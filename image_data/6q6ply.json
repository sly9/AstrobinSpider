    "description": "It's been raining here for weeks with no sight of let up so I thought I'd get creative.  This is a combination of 3 images I had taken in the past.\r\n\r\n1)  A star field\r\n2)  An overexposed waxing crescent to capture the Earthshine portion\r\n3)  First quarter moon\r\n\r\nThen I carefully layered, blended, etc in Photoshop to get this HDR image of the first quarter moon with Earthshine floating out there in outer space.  Fake picture, but kinda cool effect.  I saw whats-his-face from Australia do it and thought I'd give it a try.\r\n\r\nI didn't exactly do it right, so I may try for a more accurate version in the future.",
