    "description": "NGC 6164, at the center of the field,  appears to be a planetary nebula, however it is classified as a bipolar nebula in the Southern constellation Norma.  It is called a bipolar nebula due to the central star which is an extreme O-type star (HD 148937)with a mass of around 40 solar masses, similar to a Wolf-Rayet star thus being a mass-loss star causing the bipolar nebula.  The nebula lies at a distance of 4,200 light-years from Earth and is about 4.2 light-years across.  The beautiful filamentary outer halo was probably caused by an earlier active phase of  HD 148937.\r\nThis image is just HOO (8.5 hours Ha and 8 hours OIII) with only the stars being RGB data.  I'm going to redo it blending the RGB and Narrowband but this is what I've got, so far.\r\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\r\nTom",
