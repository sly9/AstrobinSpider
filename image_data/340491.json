    "description": "I assembled and processed this image from a four color mosaic created by the Hubble Heritage Team from  data taken from the Hubble Telescope in January 2005 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) instrument package.  The filters used were F435W (B), F555W (V), F814W (I) and F658N (H-alpha).  \r\n\r\nHere is a link to the M 51 page if you want to look at the data or try processing the data yourself - https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/m51/\r\n\r\nThe color assignments used in combining the data were:  red - blend of 50% F658N + 50% F814W, green - F555W, blue - F435W.\r\n\r\nThe original image is about 11,000 x 8,000 pixels.  The image I have uploaded is about 36% resolution.",
