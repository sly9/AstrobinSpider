    "description": "Had some technical issues and smokey skies to contend with but overall very surprised with how this turned out. I was planning on taking some shorter exposures for the core but after enduring the issues and smokey skies, I kinda lost motivation. Wish I had now! Only about 5 hours under very dark bortle 3 skies and that obviously helped. I just love how one shot color cameras do under dark skies. In dark skies, I say they are just as good as mono. At least for me the difference is negligible, in my opinion, of course.",
