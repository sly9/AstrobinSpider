    "description": "This is one tough target to get a pleasing color mix due to predominance of green/yellow in SHO palette, and a longer exposure does not really help. There are a few nice details to compensate, particularly the ionization front in shape of a huge arc on the right side of the image. It comes with a typical mix of dark columns, globules and bright rims facing unidentified hot stars that are obliterating the dark clouds. \r\nThe Tulip itself looks to me like a more random projection of bright and dark nebulosity.",
