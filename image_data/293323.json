    "description": "Montes Alpes is a mountain range in the northern part of the Moon's near side.\r\n\r\nHere we find one of the Moon's most impressive showpiece features, Vallis Alpes,  a unique feature that bisects the Montes Alpes range.\r\n\r\nVallis Alpes is a lunar valley and its floor is a flat, lava-flooded surface. Running down the center of this valley is a narrow cleft, discovered by lunar proves. This cleft is a challenging target for telescope observation from the Earth, but fortunately, nowadays, the amateurs, we can image it easily from our backyards.\r\n",
