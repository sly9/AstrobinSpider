    "description": "PK 164+31.1 is also known as Jones-Emberson 1 after its discoverers, and as the Headphone Nebula.  It is a 14th magnitude planetary nebula in the constellation Lynx at a distance of 1600 light years. It is a larger planetary with low surface brightness.  The 16.8-magnitude central star is a very blue white dwarf. The numbers in the planetary name indicate the position of the object on the sky.  \"PK 164+31.1\" basically represents the planetary nebula that when using the galactic coordinate system has a galactic longitude of 164 degrees, a galactic latitude of +31 degrees, and is the first such object in the Perek-Kohoutek catalog to occupy that particular one square degree area of sky [Wikipedia],\r\n\r\nVersion I (3/18/21) This was a 17.5 hr LRGB image of this PN but  I just added 11 hrs of Ha and OIII data for a new total of 28.5 hrs of LRGBHaOIII.    All data from DeepSkyWest, NM.  North is up.\r\n\r\n1/26/2021 (Version D):  Complete reprocessing from scratch using PI Drizzle data, TVGDenoise for NR and, very carefully, Topaz Denoise AI   --> much improved resolution of PK174 features.",
