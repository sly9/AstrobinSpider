    "description": "After many weeks of cloudy nights, I finally captured this second attempt of NGC 300 which is a Galaxy 7 million light years away, after Andromeda, this galaxy is probably the second closest to us and is in the southern constellation of Sculptor. What is so amazing is this galaxy is quite large in the camera sensor and is appx the same width of our Milky way, although there are many hot blue stars here which indicate they are young. This Galaxy is vibrant and a bit like a teenager so lots of activity and growth going on. It is inclined on a 42degree angle boasting in beauty and showing off her spiral arms, I canâ€™t help but wonder how many planets harbor here and how many resemble Earth, probably peering thru their telescopes at us.",
