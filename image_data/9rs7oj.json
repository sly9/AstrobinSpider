    "description": "This project for M33 is planned to take Ha as many as possible, in order to show the \"red flowers\" of the galaxy, and some detail of the red flowers. And finally I have accumulated 18 hours of Ha, which is good enough for this project. As for rest of the channels, only 5 hours of Lum and RGB per hour. The most difficult part of post-processing is to mix Ha with Red/Lum, the amount and how you do HDR to each channel are critical.\r\n\r\nHere are the data:\r\nHa: 15min each x 72;\r\nL: 5min each x 60;\r\nRed: 5min each x 12;\r\nGreen: 5min each x 12;\r\nBlue: 5min each x12;",
