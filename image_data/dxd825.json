    "description": "Another Image of my Polar Lights Tour, around autumn equinox 2015 near Kirkenes, Norway. I had one week of daily weather investigations, tour planning and everynight severe aurorae. (Aurorae wasnt the problem, the difficult part was finding clear skies. That far north, data from geostationary satellites is rather poor). Had the L-doveplate of my Star Adventurer with me, to mount two cameras (EOS 5D, EOS 1000 Da) in parallel on my tripod. I coundnt stop capturing until my batteries run empty. In sum it must be roughly 10000 Photos.\r\n\r\nIn the night of October 09, on my way back from Varangerfjorden, the skies opened and i found this pretty wooden church in the village of Neiden. Soon after arriving, activity started over again. The movement of this aurorae was really quick, and i had to chase them around the church, trying to quickly set my tripod in a proper position ato capture the lights in a nice framing. \r\n\r\nThis is one of the 10 best 3 images...\r\nEOS 5D MK2, EF-L 24mm f/1.4, \r\nA: 0.8s @ ISO 6400\r\nB: 1.6s @ ISO 6400 \r\n\r\nsee more images here:\r\nhttps://astrob.in/sqy43m/0/\r\nhttps://astrob.in/i7d4gq/0/\r\nhttps://astrob.in/0pysrp/B/",
