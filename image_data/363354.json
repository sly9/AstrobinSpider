    "description": "NGC 4731 is deformed galaxy located approximately 65 million light-years away in Virgo. The shape is possibly related to interaction from the larger elliptical NGC 4967 around a degree away.\r\nApparent magnitude is 11.5. \r\nNGC4731 with a size of 6.6x4.2 arc minutes, has been stretched and ripped by a larger neighboring elliptical galaxy, NGC4697. \r\n\r\nIt looks like there is not too much information about this galaxy.\r\n\r\nIMAGE:\r\nLuminance: 30x1200sec\r\nRed: 20x1200sec\r\nGreen: 20x600sec\r\nBlue: 20x1200sec\r\n\r\nTelescope: APO 120mm f/7\r\n\r\nCamera: SX694\r\n\r\nFlats, Bias and Darks applied\r\n\r\nPre-processing and Processing: Pixinsight",
