    "description": "This target was difficult to capture because the weather was windy and the mount was shaking. Fortunatly the autoguider managed to keep the stars round.\r\nI decided to take a lot of Oiii and Ha subs to make a HOO image, but I finally took a little bit of Sii just for the Hubble Palette colors.\r\n\r\nThank you to my friend Pau who lent me a bit of his garden to capture this beautiful nebula!\r\nHope you enjoy it!",
