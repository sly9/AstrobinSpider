    "description": "I love this fascinating structure.  Interesting that it doesn't have a cataloged id/description.  I had to find and enter the coordinates.  A corner of it is in the North American Nebula near the Great Lakes; looks like the wall is Boston up to Maine.  this is my second SHO image...I'll count for a while!  I'm up at Mt Pinos and captured last night.  a bit windy but got better at 2am.  there's a serious bunch of astronomers up here this week.  25 degrees cooler than home at 75 degrees here.  I'll be here for three more nights and CS on the new moon!  lucky us.  have to walk a bit down the hill to get internet...",
