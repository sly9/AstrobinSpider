    "description": "This object is a faint reflection nebula located 900 light years away in the constellation of Eridanus.  It is a large dust cloud illuminated by the reflected light of the massive nearby star Rigel off image to the right in Orion, as evidenced by the fact that the heads of the clouds point toward Rigel.  The  50 light year long cloud has a slightly bluish cast primarily because dust grains reflect blue light more efficiently than red, but also because of Rigel's strong blue color.  Although Rigel is as far from the dust cloud as Pluto is from our sun, it is able to illuminate the cloud because its luminosity is over 100,000 times that of the Sun.   As is to be expected, astronomers have found evidence that star formation is occurring in this cloud.  \r\n\r\nSeveral galaxies are visible in the image, most notably barred spiral galaxy  NGC 1752 at top center, the beautiful face-on S-shaped spiral galaxy NGC 1720 at upper left, and just below it lenticular galaxy NGC 1726.",
