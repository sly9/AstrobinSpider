    "description": "Keeping on retrieving some unprocessed / unposted to ABIN, I managed to put together several to make this \"approaching like\" image to the Boussingault crater(the  big one with the terraced walls) on the South limb ... difficult crater by the way (Vive la Libration!) and with not so many images in ABIN so I am happy to have retrieved it and be sharing it with you!. \r\n\r\nThe fun thing about Boussingault is that is a sort of Matrioska crater, 142 km in diameter (3.2 km deep), holds another large crater in the interior, Boussingault A (72 km), and also terraced which almost fills the  main crater. This creates the impression of  a crater with a double rampart. \r\n\r\nThe Moon is a fun place.... from the Earth. CS, Guillermo.",
