    "description": "Finally getting around to working this data again. This is a set from last year but I never got it quite right in terms of the edit. I finally worked it again though and I am much more happy with it. I took a lot of advice from Le_Baron and Nico Carver (thank you both very much!) on my last edit of it that was never posted and what I could do to improve. They both suggested that the Squid could use so more contrast and that it was all just a solid blue color, no really transparency to it. So I did my best to fix that in this new edit. I am still not entirely pleased with it, but it has come a really long way compared to just editing it like I would a normal image. Regardless, this was definitely one of the most difficult data sets I have had to work with yet, the thing is just so damn dim you can’t see it at all in a single frame. Just a blast though to see it complete and I couldn’t be happier.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
