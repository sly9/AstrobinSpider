    "description": "I started this project when quarantine was declared, two months ago convinced that it would end. But the damn clouds are still here, something unpublished here. What's wrong with the weather? ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤\r\n\r\nThe original idea was to also create an NB image and combine it, adding a final luminance in H-alpha to reduce the stellar field so massive that I don't particularly like it. I hope to finish it next year because it will no longer be possible.\r\nGreetings friends and take care.\r\n\r\nIÃ±igo Gamarra.",
