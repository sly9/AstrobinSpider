    "description": "This ended up being a tortuous experience which i wouldn't let go - who said taking a dark object from UK skies would be straight forwards? \r\n\r\nUltimately over (too) many evenings, this is a four pane mosaic of LDN1495 taken with my multi-scope-wide-field rig or I would still be taking this next year. Approx 50 hours of Lum data and 40 hours of RGB were used to tease out some details. These totalled - \r\n\r\nL - 132x10' and 160x7' and 128x6'\r\nR - 271x3'\r\nG - 264x3'\r\nB - 264x3'\r\n\r\nThis may seem excessive because it is. However i managed to not have enough data to reliably stitch the top to the bottom and had to reshoot a central strip so i guess if i had managed this first time around it would average at 15h a panel which is less excessive ;-)\r\n\r\nI normally use Pixinsight, but i just couldn't make the mosaic processing work this time and in the end used APP for stitching the raw frames together, and then moved back to PI. This was my first time using APP and what a great programme they have produced so will look deeper into this in the future.\r\n\r\nLDN 1495 is a large dark nebula that dominates this field of view though there are other objects including LBN782 (Cederblad 30) and a few background galaxies hiding as well.",
