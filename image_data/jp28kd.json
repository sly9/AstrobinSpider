    "description": "First target with my newly acquired Chroma filters.\r\n\r\nI found that I have some issues with my OIII filter, that I need to figure out. After stacking it seems like my reducer spacing is not adjusted correctly, but my Ha filter seems ok, so that does not make a lot of sense. Could also be that my primary focus just drifted. \r\n\r\nI guess it wouldn't be fun if it was easy... :D",
