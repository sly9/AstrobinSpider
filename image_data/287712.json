    "description": "It is interesting that the Hubble Palette image shows more of a halo around primary nebula. That is due mostly from the O3 data and some from the H-alpha. the S2 image is very weak, as you would expect. Also, it was easy to substitute the RGB stars for the  white tone mapped stars. In this case that meant just placing the Hubble Palette PN on the RGB background. The exception to that is the placement of the three colored stars at the center of the nebula itself.",
