    "description": "This is an image of the Parrot Nebula aka the Seagull Nebula in Monoceros. I captured it with narrowband filters to show the interaction of sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen in this region of the sky.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to illustrate the use of “mapped color” also called “false color” to show off the interaction of the different elements within the nebula. I used what is now a classic mapping called the “Hubble Palette” where SII is mapped to Red, Ha is mapped to Green, and OIII is mapped to Blue. Astrophotographers often just use the acronym SHO to make it clear they are using this mapping.",
