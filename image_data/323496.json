    "description": "This object, a combination of a dark nebula and a reflection nebula, is located about 1,400 light years away in the constellation of Cepheus. Although the name suggests that this sky object resembles a wolf's cave, this object is actually named after Max Wolf, the astronomer who announced its discovery in 1908.  \r\n\r\nThe large dark nebula stretching through the frame is Barnard 175. The opaque dust blocks most of the starlight behind it, but blue light from a young star is scattered and reflected off some of the particles to illuminate the reflection part of the nebula. Though stars do form in molecular clouds, this star seems to have only accidentally wandered into the area, as its measured velocity through space is very different from the cloud's velocity. This true color image of the region spans about 4 light-years, or about 250,000 times the distance from the earth to the sun.",
