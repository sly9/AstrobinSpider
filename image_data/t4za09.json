    "description": "NGC 2014 and 2020 are a striking pair of nebulae of contrasting structure in the LMC – one an apparent mass of small globules rich in Ha and SII emissions, the other an OIII-emitting ring nebula created from its central Wolf-Rayet star.  Both were featured in a 30th anniversary image from the Hubble Space Telescope called the “Cosmic Reef”.",
