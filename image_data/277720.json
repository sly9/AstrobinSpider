    "description": "This has been a challenging target both to collect the data and process.  It is faint and late December conditions in Devon, UK, have not been very favourable for long image capture sessions and I have grabbed the data whenever I've had a clear patch.  I tried some 600s subs but had to discard these due to gradients, perhaps I will try again on another occasion.  There was a lot of work stretching the tenuous reflection nebula and encouraging the surrounding emission nebula to reveal its pinky-red colouring, all without blowing (too much) the abundant stars.\r\n\r\nI think this target is frequently overlooked for its more famous and rewarding neighbours, the Soul and Heart nebulas.  I am (mostly) satisfied with this image for now.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking, C&Cs always welcome.",
