    "description": "This is a 4-panel mosaic taken with a ZWO ASI2600 color camera and Samyang 135mm f/2 lens (wide open).  Even with the narrowband L-eXtreme filter I only took 45 x 60 seconds per panel--gotta love f/2!  I spent an hour using the star catalog mosaic aligning and merging tools in PixInsight based on some good detailed tutorials, but in the end letting Microsoft ICE combine it in 20 seconds with no user input actually gave better results.  Full resolution final mosaic was 84 megapixels.",
