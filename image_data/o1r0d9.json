    "description": "IC 447 (and friends) is a large reflection nebula located in the Constellation of Monoceros. Beautiful blue glow immersed in the sorrounding H-alpha emission; coupled with dark nebula on the northwest, this field offers a rich view. This time I adopted a slightly different workflow with the help of my friend <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/mxcoppell/\">Min</a>, which offers a better control on the stars and in-turn help emphasizing the color and structure of the nebula. Still adapting myself to it and a lot to learn/try.\r\n\r\nI frame this target with this protrait framing in mind; During processing with landscape framing my wife took a sneak peek, and pointed out that it looks like a swimming whale (big head/body, small tail, and two bubbles above). The more I look at it that way, I have to say it does resemble what she describes :)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/search/?q=TeamNoctuaDSNM&subject=&telescope=&camera=&date_published_min=2011-11-09&date_published_max=2099-05-10\"><I>#TeamNoctuaDSNM</I></ a>",
