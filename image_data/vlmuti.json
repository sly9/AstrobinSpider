    "description": "NGC 2992 and 2993 in Hydra are collectively known as No. 245 in astronomer Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. An interacting pair of galaxies, NGC 2992, above and right,\r\nis a Seyfert, Sa-type galaxy. Equally beautiful NGC 2993 at lower left is clearly tidally bound to its companion. The pair was discovered in 1785 by William Herschel, and are about 104,000,000 light-years away from Earth. Many thanks go out to my collaborator and friend, Mike Selby, who acquired and calibrated this fine data in 2021.",
