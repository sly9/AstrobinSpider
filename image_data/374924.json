    "description": "This is my second attempt at this.  Previously I used my that same scope but with a DSLR.  It's amazing what a sensitive monochrome camera and darker skies will do!\r\n\r\nI took the colour at home under Bortle 6 skies.  The luminance was taken under Bortle 2 skies.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did a deconvulation of the luminance.  It took a long time to get the masking right for this, but I'm pleased with the results.",
