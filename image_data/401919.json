    "description": "This object is a beautiful galaxy group located 50 million light years away in the constellation of Virgo. Markarian's Chain is named after an Armenian astronomer in the 1970s and represents a stretch of galaxies that forms part of the Virgo Cluster. This image field of view captures about half of the galaxies in the chain.\r\n\r\nAt the lower left and lower center are two large but featureless elliptical galaxies, M84 and M86. Prominent on the right side are a pair of interacting galaxies known as The Eyes (Arp 120), with a spectacular sprawling dust lane. Other beautiful spiral galaxies are also evident in this image, some with striking dark dust lanes. The tiny blue irregular galaxy at the lower right shaped like an \"L\" is IC 3355.\r\n\r\nThe bright galaxies in the image are beautiful.  But I also enjoy the hundreds of faint galaxies scattered throughout the background and visible in the full resolution view.  I especially like the many tiny galaxies visible when looking through and just above the bright elliptical galaxy M84 (NGC 4374) on the left side of the image.",
