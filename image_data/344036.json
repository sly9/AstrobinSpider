    "description": "This object is a pair of interacting galaxies known as Arp 104, located 20 million light years away in the constellation of Ursa Major.  The disturbed barred spiral galaxy on the right is NGC 5218, while the elliptical galaxy on the left is NGC 5216.  This galaxy pair is named after astronomer P. C. Keenan, who first observed the wondrous filament that connects the two galaxies.\r\n\r\nThe filament is comprised of a cosmic trail of gas, dust, and stars, resulting from the gravitational interaction between these two galaxies.  The trail is 20,000 light-years long.  Also of interest, and tangentially aligned with the filament, is the single arm which extends out from the elliptical galaxy.  Normally, elliptical galaxies are featureless, so this arm is also likely the result of the gravitational interaction.\r\n\r\nAlmost as interesting as the filament to me is the unique shape of NGC 5218.  It is hard to know because we only see it from one point of view, but it looks like a barred spiral galaxy with an outer arm that is wildly distorted out of plane.  The distorted core is very bright, perhaps the result of star formation being excited by the gravitational disturbance. \r\n\r\nA number of smaller, faint galaxies are also visible in the image.",
