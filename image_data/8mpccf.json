    "description": "Shot at my favorite location during 4 nights (21./22./23./24. 2. 2020).\r\nI got about 9,5 hours of light. Removing bad frames the set was reduced to about 7 hours for processing.\r\nAt the lower left corner one can see some remaining artefacts from removing geostationary satellites. And there were a lot. Just 3 5-minute-frames do not have any satellite trails at all!\r\nProcessing was made with PixInsight and I did the processing 3 times from scratch to get out the most of the set. Thx for some very helpful critical comments to Helmut K.",
