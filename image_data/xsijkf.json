    "description": "LBN 923 region is another fantastic target right outside Orion. It shows up in pretty much most of the wide-field images of  IC2118 (just a little north to it). The whole region is filled with dust clouds and background H-II signals. I had this thing that I always want to blend the reflection and emission signals together - here it goes again. \r\n\r\nJim Thommes' has a very nice page to give more details of this area: <a href=\"http://jthommes.com/Astro/NGC1788.htm\">LBN 923 Region and vdB33</a>.\r\n\r\nThe weather of our remote observatory was far from optimal this winter. Not sure if it's the same case for everywhere in North America recently.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/search/?q=TeamNoctuaDSNM&subject=&telescope=&camera=&date_published_min=2011-11-09&date_published_max=2099-05-10\"><I>#TeamNoctuaDSNM</I></a>",
