    "description": "The Gum Nebula (Gum 12) is a nebula that covers approx 40° in the constellations Vela. It lies approx 1300 lightyears  from the Earth.\r\nThese thin strands of nebulosity are the remains of a star which ended its life as an enormous supernova explosion around 11,000 years ago.\r\nIt got its name after its discoverer, the Australian astronomer Colin Stanley Gum(1924–1960).\r\n\r\nExposures: 55 x 5  minutes with  OIII- and 48 x 5 minutes with Ha-filter, \r\nusing a FLI 16801 Fingerlake CCD camera on a Takahashy FSQ 106 with 530 mm focal length on a Paramount ME mount.\r\n\r\nAll images were exposed remotely on the Siding Spring iTelescop Farm at T08.\r\nBetween January 27th and February 21st 2017.\r\n\r\nThe RGB image was created by loading \r\nHa into R\r\nOIII into G  and\r\nOIII into B",
