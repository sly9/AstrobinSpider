    "description": "Here we have a very interesting pair of globular clusters located in Scorpius and familiar to all of us as appearing in the field of view of the spectacular Rho Ophiucus Molecular Cloud.  I had thought that this pair had some interesting similarities to a recent image I did of M53 and NGC 5053 which gave me the idea to image these two together. \r\n\r\nWith respect to the location of the Rho Ophiucus Molecular Cloud, Messier 4 and NGC 6144 are both much further away.  Antares the red giant which lights up a lot of Rho Ophiucus , would be just off the frame to the left and lies about 550 ly away, M4 which is one of the closest globulars to us is about 7,200 ly away and NGC 6144 is way out there at about 27,000 to 33,000 ly distant.  \r\n\r\nI struggled a bit with the color on this one and finally settled on this which is definitely biased towards yellow and red for the globulars.  My thought was that their light is filtered through that nebulosity and would likely be a bit more yellow/red than a globular that is more or less unobstructed.  I am fairly pleased with the way they came out although it was a bit of a struggle processing this.  I have not done a lot of subjects with a lot of nebulosity lately and I really had to work to get the background extraction how I thought it should be done.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you like this one...  Clear Skies and good health!",
