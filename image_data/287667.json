    "description": "This image of SQ represents everything I know how to do ... I used pretty much every technique I know of to sharpen, reduce noise, increase color etc etc etc ... hope it's not \"overdone\".  For example, color and contrast amplification was done using Lab Color techniques in PS CS 6, noise reduction was done using the Camera Raw noise reduction with a layer mask. Stretching was done using levels, not curves, to preserve the stellar nuclei. \r\nThe data was collected over several months and any frames that did not meet sharpness criteria were rejected. It was taken with my RCOS 14.5\" f/8 classical cassegrain and a Starlight Xpress 694 which uses a superb Sony chip with high QE. Astrodon filters helped separate out the colors. Taken from my home observatory in Foresthill, CA. \r\nNotice the faint blue glow to the left of SQ ... that is actually real and is blue in color ... it is a super faint star stream of some sort IMHO. \r\n    More details as follows:\r\n14 out of 25 LUM picked for sharpness, 1500 seconds binned 1 X 1.  16 RGB 1500 seconds binned 2 X 2.  Astro-Physics 2.7\" telecompressor used to bring the f/ratio down to f/6.6 from f/8.  Initial processing done in CCDStack.  Deconvolution done in AIP4WIN original version with noise filter applied.  Master 16 bit Tiff file imported into PS for stretching and color work ... extensive use of PS tools to control noise and sharpness.  Stars reduced in size using Russ Croman's excellent Star Shrink software.  ",
