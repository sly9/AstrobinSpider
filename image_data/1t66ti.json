    "description": "M94 - The Crocodile's Eye or Cat's Eye Galaxy (looks more like the crocodile's to me ðŸ˜„)\r\n\r\nThe weather did not allow me to take Luminance for this object so I instead built a synthetic luminance.  The halo that surrounds M94 can be seen to some extent, but to reveal that faint structure in more detail, I need Luminance and darker skies (I don't have one or the other ðŸ˜¢)\r\n\r\nSynthetic Luminance is a technique that I have used quite successfully lately. Every time I start a broadband object I take the RGB frames first. This way if the weather betrays me, I can at least build a synthetic luminance, process the image and get a fairly reasonable result.\r\n\r\nLocation:  My backyard in Caguas, Puerto Rico / Sky Quality 18.3 (almost Bortle 8, yes it is BAD!)",
