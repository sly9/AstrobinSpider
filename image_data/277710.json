    "description": " This field is the LDN 1495 Region in the constellation of Taurus. LDN 1495 is a large dark nebula that dominates but is not fully encompassed by this field.  The blue nebula on the left is LBN 782 also known as Cederblad 30. On the right side is a brighter portion of the dark nebula – this contains two Orion type variable, a young stellar object and a brown dwarf. There are also a number of background galaxies - one is IC 359 the dominant galaxy in Galaxy group in the lower right.  IC359  is estimated to be  182 million light years distant from Earth (stated as billion light years in the annotated image).",
