    "description": "Like Jupiter, Saturn is setting earlier each day and the chances to have good seeing conditions are fewer and further between. I also capture a lot of data to get a decent Saturn image, so I need the seeing to be good for about an hour and as some of you may know that is not always easy to achieve. Nevertheless on the evening of the 26th I was fortunate to have such conditions. \r\nThe good seeing allowed the resolution of a lot of subtle atmospheric detail on the planet and it is pleasing to have perhaps the last decent Saturn image of this apparition, which has been a very good one for me I have to say.",
