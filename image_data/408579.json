    "description": "Yay for editing kicks. \r\n\r\nHere was another, in classic SHO. Didn't want to get too crazy with the colors on this one, and thought the standard palette fit it nicely. Still a great object though, although I did do some generous cropping to get it framed how I liked. That part I did get a bit more creative with. Sacrifice some background for a more aesthetically pleasing image.",
