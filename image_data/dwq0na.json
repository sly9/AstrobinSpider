I am totally positively surprised which new upswing I am experiencing again. It's great fun to be able to edit new data again. In view of the fact that we don't often have good weather here and when the moon is usually out, I decided to go with narrowband photography like a good friend. Now that the first dates are in the box and I was able to approach procesing with a helping hand, I am very happy to have made the decision.\r\nMy familiarization with PixInsight is in full swing, as my two boys allow it ... haha ​​... :)\r\nMany thanks to nikita misiura for the great tool in PI. I will now turn to the OIII and SII data. Let's see what comes out of it. The fact is, the classy narrowband recordings here at Astrobin have enough excitement ...\r\nI'm looking forward to the future and of course the next clear sky :-)\r\nhave a good time and clear skys to all ...\r\nDaniel",
