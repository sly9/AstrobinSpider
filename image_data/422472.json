    "description": "Whilst working through my July data, I realised I had overlooked this data set when creating my \"approaching opposition\" animation.\r\n\r\nThe data quality was quite good, with a very clear capture of the polar hexagon and polar vortex. Hints of storm activity are also evident in the polar region. Depending on your screen's gamma setting, you should also be able to make out the fainter, inner C ring.\r\n\r\nThis image is a de-rotation of 12 x 90s captures, stacking the best 15% of 4,500 frames each. Total frames of data is therefore equivalent to 8,100.",
