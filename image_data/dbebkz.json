    "description": "Second light for my Tak Epsilon. Since I didn't have too much time due to the weather conditions, I decided to use my ASI 294 as color camera. As target the famous Horsehead Nebula had to be used. Although imaged so many times (and this is also my second attempt at this region) I have to say that I am positively surprised about the result:\r\n\r\nAlnitak is a difficult to control canidate in the field of view and the wild mix of H-Alpha areas, emission nebulae and dark nebulae certainly makes this area one of the most challenging to image. \r\n\r\nAs expected, the H-Alpha extensions above the horse's head are not as pronounced as one would expect from pure narrow-band photography. However, there are much more details, shades and features in the areas of the dark nebulae. There even seems to be some reflections mixed with the dark nebulae below the horse's head! :-)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it! :-)",
