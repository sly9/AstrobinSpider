    "description": "Once again, during work to check my archival Jupiter and Saturn videos for impacts using the DeTeCt software by Marc Delcroix, I discovered that I hadn't processed the data from a run on Mars from just before closest approach in 2020. I made 15 RGB runs of 4 mins per colour channel that night. I was imaging across much of the night and the seeing was clearly best in the middle of the run when the planet's altitude was greatest. This image is derived from just 3 runs where the seeing was excellent. It is nice to discover an unpolished gem like this.\nMost prominent just on the f side of the Meridian is the iconic Sinus Gomer with its two isthmus jutting north from Mare Cimmerium into the Elysium Planitia. To the north, the peak of Elysium Mons is quite prominent and there is good detail of its surroundings. Thick blue white cloud extends down towards it from the north polar region. On its p side; the vast plains of Amazonis Planitia extend towards Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes, however, the sun has already set on them and they are around the terminator. However, thick orographic clouds that can often be seen around their peaks are still visible at the terminator. The planet was still only 98% illuminated at this time.",
