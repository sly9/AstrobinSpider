    "description": "Hey Kid! Happy 4th of July! Here's some Solar fireworks. The same prom as yesterday still active today. 185 frames @ 30fps. Conditions decayed a bit because I actually started out with 250 frames. That seems to be the pattern here in Nashville. I start shooting around 9:30am and around 11 things get poor. Oh well. Notice some of the activity on the right, very dim but neat. Enjoy!",
