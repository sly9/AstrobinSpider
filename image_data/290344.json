    "description": "Here is my first attempt at M95. I had issues with cloud and poor seeing the first night, so had another go at capturing the following night with pretty much the same issues. This target is also pretty low from my location at 52:30N with it never reaching 50deg above the horizon and much of the capture when down in the mid 30s to mid 40s altitude. That turned out to be the least of my problems as I found this a nightmare to process, using only 15 of the 24 luminence. The RGB data wasn't much better, but rightly or wrongly I used as much as I dare, but even then had to discard several subs.\r\nI'm still learning how to tackle LRGB capture and processing and wonder whether the image scale of the C14 is too much at low altitudes in poor seeing. Focus doesn't look great on lots of the subs, so maybe I also need to work on that some...",
