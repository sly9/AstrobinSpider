    "description": "Ok so here is my third pass at the Trifid (M20) nebula this year.  If you have looked at my page then you know that this is my favorite DSO, it is the perfect target hosting dark (black), emission (red),  and reflection (blue).  I really am pleased with the results of this image.  Of course I am always looking to improve, so any brutally honest comments are welcome lol (despite the apparent need for a coma corrector... I Primed it so hopefully 2 days).  Thanks for stopping by!\r\n-JMB",
