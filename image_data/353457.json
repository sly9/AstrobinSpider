    "description": "ARP286 consists of a beautiful trio of interacting galaxies in Virgo.   The system lies about 90 million light years from us.   Deep exposures reveal a tidal stream bridging the two largest of the galaxies due to past interactions.   That feature is actually visible in an extreme stretch of my image, but it pushes it WAY out of \"pretty picture\" territory.     To me, most interesting aspect of this image is the variation of galactic colors and structures which is actually complimented by the foreground stars.   It is quite a menagerie.  \r\n\r\nI have amassed quite a backlog of data to process.   I'm trying to stay less than 2 months behind, but its really getting close now.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
