    "description": "Taken on the 20thApr17. Caught a rare break in the clouds and without the moon (set to rise at 4am). Just an hour in each filter.\r\n\r\nRev B: A crop to really zoom in on my poor sky :-)\r\n\r\nRev C: Got an hours gap in between the clouds and have added the extra subs, still a poor sky but better colour. Combined from the extracted L.a.b from the RGB and recombined using my Luminance stack with the a and b extracts.\r\n\r\nRev D: Reprocessed the subs 18thFeb18.",
