    "description": "One of the most massive extended objects in the known universe is the Perseus-Pisces Supercluster.   It spans 300 million light years and is home to thousands upon thousands of galaxies.   At one end of this supercluster lies Abell426, the Perseus Cluster.   This cluster is considered to be the richest grouping in the entire supercluster.   \r\n\r\nThe Perseus Cluster itself is home to hundreds of large galaxies and, in fact, doesnâ€™t fit into my FOV here.    The two dominant ones are the large ellipticals NGC1275 (left) and NGC1272 (right).    NGC1275 is a rather unique elliptical with thin filaments of emission Nebula extending all throughout like a cosmic spider web.  Unfortunately at this resolution it is only barely perceptible, so I recommend a look at the Hubble image of the area.  \r\n\r\nIf ever you question our cosmic significance, images like this can provide perspective.   ðŸ˜‰\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
