Leading portion of the NEB outbreak is setting on the eastern limb, its turbulent wake extending half way across the planet.  Oval BA is approaching central meridian having slid pass the GRS in recent days.\r\n\r\nThe image is a combination of 10,660 best frames acquired between 6:36 and 6:54 pm local time.",
