    "description": "SH2-199 or the Soul Nebula is an emission nebula located in the constellation Cassiopeia. Several small open clusters are embedded in the nebula: \r\nThis complex is the eastern neighbor of IC1805 (Heart Nebula) and the two are often mentioned together as the \"Heart and Soul\".\r\n\r\nThe nebula, spans an area of sky equivalent to four full moons and is about 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia. Like other massive star-forming regions, such as Orion and Carina, it contains large cavities that were carved out by radiation and winds from the region's most massive stars. According to the theory of triggered star formation, the carving out of these cavities pushes gas together, causing it to ignite into successive generations of new stars.",
