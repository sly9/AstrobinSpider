    "description": "It was a challenge, not with the target itself but with the nature!\r\nI had only few hours within 2 nights to image WR 134, Dec 3 & 4, 2020. \r\nIn the first night I had a window of around 1 hour before the moon rises, on the 2nd night I had only around 2 hours, then managed some Ha with moon light.\r\nNot only that, the target was very low, I started imaging at altitude 45 degrees, the last sub was taken at altitude 6 degrees!\r\nHOO + RGB stars, zero crop.",
