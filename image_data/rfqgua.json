    "description": "The Whirlpool Galaxy (Messier 51) is located some 27 million light years distant in the constellation of Canes Venatici. It was discovered by Charles Messier on 13 October 1773. In the New General Catalogue, M51 is designated NGC 5194 and its companion NGC 5195.\r\n\r\nMessier 51 was photographed between 22 February and 28 March 2020 from a rig in Spain that is privately owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me.  In May 2018. I imaged M51 from my home observatory in the UK using the identical telescope, camera and filters.  As such, it seemed to make sense to reuse the Lum and Ha from the May 2018 run. \r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC 140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS (2020); Mesu 200 (2018)\r\n\r\nHa: 21 x 1200s (2020) \r\nHa: 14 x 1200s (2018)\r\nLum: 48 x 600s (2020)\r\nLum: 27 x 600s (2018)\r\nRed: 48 x 300s\r\nGreen 48 x 300s\r\nBlue: 48 x 300s\r\n\r\nA total of 36 hours and 10 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson",
