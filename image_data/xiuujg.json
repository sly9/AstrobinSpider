    "description": "This is a wide field image of NGC6334 -Cat's Paw Nebula and the War and Peace Nebula NGC6357 also known by some as the Lobster Nebula.\r\n\r\nFrames captured over many nights in May and June 2020.\r\n\r\n The narrowband data was taken mainly from my Bortle 4 skies at home and some from a dark site called Terrick Terrick national Park in Victoria Australia. All Broadband data was taken from Terrick Terrick national park. My Skymeter readings are 21.51 with the Milky Way core high above but it is known usually as a 22.00 site.\r\n\r\nI have also done a SHO image which can be found at:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/1t6lwg/",
