    "description": "My last image with ASI1600. The skies were transparent and plenty dark - 21.6 at zenith past midnight. I spent just one night on this target, shooting about 4.5h L and 3h RGB - it could have used much more. The details in the galaxies themselves are satisfying, but despite a strong stretch I could only bring out a hint of IFN.",
