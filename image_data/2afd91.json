    "description": "Polar-Ring Galaxy NGC660\r\n\r\nThe Arecibo radio dish is sadly being decommissioned following the failure of two support cables in August and November 2020.  At a diameter of 305 meters, the spherical dish was the largest single aperture telescope in the world for 53 years until the construction in 2016 of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in China. During its illustrious 57-year history, the Arecibo Observatory has been at the forefront of numerous scientific endeavors and discoveries.  \r\n\r\nIn January 2013, researchers using the Arecibo telescope in a multi-year study of molecules in nearby galaxies reported an unexpected and dramatic outburst of energy in the polar-ring galaxy NGC660.  The magnitude of this outburst was reported as about ten times brighter than a supernova explosion and possibly resulting from a tremendous jet emanating from the galaxy's central black hole.  A subsequent study using a combination of archival radio and Chandra X-ray data, together with new radio observations made using e-MERLIN in mid-2013 showed a new compact and extremely bright continuum source at the center of the galaxy.  The authors concluded “that we are seeing a period of new active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in the core of this polar ring galaxy.”\r\n\r\nNGC660 has an apparent size of 2.7 x 0.8 arc-minutes and magnitude of 12.0. \r\n\r\nThe description from Wikipedia states: “NGC 660 is a peculiar and unique polar-ring galaxy located approximately 45 million light years from Earth in the Pisces constellation.[3] It is the only such galaxy having, as its host, a \"late-type lenticular galaxy\".[4] It was probably formed when two galaxies collided a billion years ago.[5] However, it may have first started as a disk galaxy that captured matter from a passing galaxy. This material could have, over time, become \"strung out\" to form a rotating ring.\r\nThe ring is not actually polar, but rather has an inclination from the plane of the host disk of approximately 45 degrees.[4] The extreme number of pinkish star-forming areas that occurs along the galaxy's ring could be the result of the gravitation interaction caused by this collision. The ring is 50,000 light-years across - much broader than the disk itself - and has a greater amount of gas and star formation than the host ring. This likely indicates a very violent formation.” \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the image!\r\n\r\nOnline references used for this narrative:\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory\r\nhttps://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/the-arecibo-telescope-has-collapsed/\r\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AAS...22345412A/abstract\r\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017OAst...26...88S/abstract\r\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/279968151_A_new_period_of_activity_in_the_core_of_NGC660\r\nhttps://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1348a/\r\nhttps://phys.org/news/2013-01-massive-outburst-neighbor-galaxy-astronomers.html\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_660",
