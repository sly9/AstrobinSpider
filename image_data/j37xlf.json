    "description": "This is a first light photo of NGC 7000 with a QHY183M. After imaging for two years of Fuji X1, then two years with a QHY168c, it made sense to try narrowband imaging from a suburban backyard (SQM 19.7). As a first light image, it is intended to see if anything will come out, as the image acquisition and processing workflows are considerably different. The experience was at the same time challenging, frustrating, and  ultimately exhilarating. It is clear that the demands on seeing conditions and tracking by the mount have increased significantly.",
