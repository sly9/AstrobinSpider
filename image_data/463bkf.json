    "description": "I started working on this project all the way back at the end of January. Finally, though, I threw in the towel and process what data I had. I did have a little over four hours of luminance data to add in the mix. But, I had an \"oh why did I do that\" moment and accidentally deleted all the Lum data and never had clear skies again to recapture it. Oh, well maybe next year I will have better luck :-)",
