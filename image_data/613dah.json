    "description": "M101 is large spiral galaxy 170,000 light years in diameter and is located 21 million light years away. It's almost twice as big as the Milky Way at 100,000 light years in diameter and has twice the number of stars in the Milky Way. It does not appear to have a supermassive black hole at its core based on radio and x-ray emissions.\r\n\r\nFor this image I decided to attempt to enhance RGB data with Ha and OIII data. My goal was to emphasize the HII star framing regions and bring out the faint spiral arms. I used StarNet++ to remove the stars from the Ha and OIII stacks and used the PixInsight NBRGB Combination script to handle the blending of this data into the RGB data. I used a light tough on the enhancement using Ha to augment the red channel and OIII to augment the blue channel. \r\n\r\nAcquisition Details:\r\n\r\nNights 4-26-2020 and 4-27-2020\r\nGrain 75, temp -10C\r\nRed: 71 x 240 sec\r\nGreen: 71 x 240 sec\r\nBlue: 71 x 240 sec\r\n\r\nNights 4-28-2020 and 4-29-2020\r\nGain 139, temp -10C\r\nHa: 68 x 360 sec\r\nOIII: 49 x 360 sec",
