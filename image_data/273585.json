    "description": "This is my second processing of this data - this time it was done mostly in PI and turned out to be much better.\r\n\r\nThis FOV, although it seems to be dull and boring at a first glance, is full of interesting objects and striking details. Aside from two main objects it has huge number of tiny galaxies across the field.\r\n\r\nI was surprised by amount of detail on M 106 and NGC 4217  we were able to capture with only 4\" scope - just take a look at revisions D and E!\r\n\r\nRev D:\r\n\r\nClose up on beautiful core of M 106. You can see striking amount of details in Ha image! Also, there are two Ha regions visible in small NGC 4248! \r\n\r\nRev E:\r\n\r\nClose up on NGC 4217. I really love this galaxy - its distorted dust lane looks very nice. And together with nearby colorful stars it makes a wonderful picture.",
