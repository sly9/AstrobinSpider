    "description": "From WiKi\r\nNGC 3631 is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation Ursa Major. It is located at a distance of circa 35 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 3631 is about 60,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on April 14, 1789. It is a grand design spiral galaxy seen face on.\r\nTaken last November from my garden ROR Shed. I had some spare time yesterday and decided to try processing it. \r\nThanks for looking.\r\nDave",
