    "description": "Wolf-Rayet stars are extremely hot, bright, massive stars, and one of the rarest classes of stars known. As of 2018, only 154 had been identified in the Milky Way. Some produce spectacular nebula -- e.g. the Bubble nebula, and the Crescent nebula -- thanks to their strong stellar winds, intense ultraviolet emissions, and clouds of gasses that they shed in earlier stages of their relatively brief lives.\r\n\r\nBack in July, I captured a spectrogram of WR-134 -- the bright white star near the center of the frame -- and two other Wolf-Rayets in Cygnus, and saw that a few other people had captured a graceful nebula surrounding it. So, here is my capture of WR-134's nebula, in HOO pallet with RGB stars. WR-134 is about 6000 light-years distant. Five times the diameter of our sun, it is 400,000 times more luminous, with a surface temperature of over 60,000 degrees celsius. With the stars removed, it becomes more evident that the O-iii extends in an iris-like ring around the central star. I'll need to revisit this next summer with a 3nm O-iii filter.",
