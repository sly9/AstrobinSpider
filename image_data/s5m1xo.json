    "description": "I reoriented the camera to approximately 360 degrees and shortened the exposure to 90 seconds (vice 120second lights).  The sky wasn't as kind as the night before however the field was more interesting.  The comet was still around 0.72 AU from earth and 1.2 AU from the sun photographically displaying interesting color and tail structure.\n\nPredicted to fade as the moon reenters the sky.\n\nDan",
