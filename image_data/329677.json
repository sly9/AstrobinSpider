    "description": "ARP87 consists of NGC3808A and NGC3808B which are around 300mly distant in Leo.   The pair of spirals underwent a recent interaction (a couple hundred million years ago) that left streams of stars stretched across inter-galactic space.  I was happy to see that I was able to capture the faint tendrils that wrap around the smaller galaxy at least twice.   As a result, I just gave it the first name that popped in my head.   It reminded me of a big spool feeding a spindle.   The bright blue of star birth activity can clearly be seen in the disturbed arms.   There is a beauty of a face-on spiral down in the corner of the full image, too.     I'm uploading a second revision which is just a crop into the center to make the target galaxies more visible.  \r\n\r\nI can add this to the list of crazy small targets I went after at the end of 2017.   I've been shut down for several weeks due to weather.   So, I poked around with this dataset and it was of surprising quality for the amount of integration I was able to acquire.    The pairing is barely more than an arc-minute wide.",
