    "description": "I took this on the morning of September 16, 2020 looking at the Skyway Bridge in Burlington, Ontario. We have had forest fire smoke over most of southern Canada and almost all of the US for at least a week, reducing transparency and providing an ominous glimpse of the future. Most people I talk to about the skies think it is just high level cloud.\r\n\r\nThe exposures are spaced by 150 seconds.\r\n\r\nLuckily tonight, September 17th looks a little better.",
