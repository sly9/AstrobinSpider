    "description": "The 3330 light-year distance in the Cepheus constellation is NGC 7129. This reflection fog is home to nearly 130 young stars, many of which are younger than 1 million years old. These stars illuminate and reveal details of fog. Near the NGC 7129 some deep red crescent shaped shapes are formed, \"Herbig-Haro\", which indicates areas where new stars are born. These red regions are made up of ionized hydrogen, which is compressed into interesting forms by the shock wave of young, emerging stars. It is assumed that a similar starboard cradle was born in our Day, approx. 5 billion years ago. From a photographic point of view, the NGC 7129 has about 7 arc diameters and has a very low surface brightness, so capturing has had some challenges.",
