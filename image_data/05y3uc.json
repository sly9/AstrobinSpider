    "description": "After working for almost 2 weeks to get the data and stitch the images together at least 1 panel is worth presenting. It was impossible so far to get the panels together, and I certainly will try further, but for now I do need to take a break. Not quite sure why the stitched images with PI introduced a scaling problem. Getting 2 panels together was no problem, but as soon as the next set is added the stitching does not work out anymore. I guess I have to go back to \"manual\" stitching, but only after a longer break!",
