    "description": "Directly after returning from a buisiness trip me and my son prepared our equipment and went to our observatory in the mountains. Tonight was the first night I saw Neowise. Luckily only a few clouds but some serious half moon were working against us. On my Eq-6R I took several shots. Unfortunately the ionic tail stayed unvisible and even through a large binocular the comet appeared quite reddish. Using the Nikon of my son, I took three of the exposed pics and merged them together. As scope I used my little Williams Apo with an aperture of 90 and a focal length of 620. \r\n3x60 sec at Iso 1000",
