    "description": "This one was pretty difficult to capture and process. For a Planetary Nebula, there is very little OIII, so I concentrated mostly on the Ha structure. I tried to do it justice by really piling on the integration time. It reminds me a lot of the Squid Nebula (Ou4), but mostly in Ha instead of OIII. Ou4 is bipolar as well.\r\n\r\nLocated in the constellation of Cassiopeia just off the famous Bubble Nebula, KjPn8 (also known as PN G112.5-00.1) is a very unusual bipolar planetary nebula. Its complex structure is the result of irregular ejections of gas in different directions. It is about 14′ x 4′ in size, so given my focal length and image scale I cropped the image a lot. The edge of the Bubble Nebula was actually in the corner of the image before cropping. The radial velocity measurements suggest a distance of ~5,200 light years.",
