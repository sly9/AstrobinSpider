    "description": "What a blast of a target to revisit this year around. This has always been one of my favorite nebulae in the southern hemisphere, and while I was happy with last years rendition, I think the added frames and a bit more of a careful hand when processing really helped this version shine. \r\n\r\nWith this and my last post though, I guess there is only one more image to post from this region. I wonder what it will be? ;)",
