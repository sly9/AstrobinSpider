    "description": "NGC 3199 is an emission nebula located around 12,000 light-years from Earth, in the southern constellation of Carina. The nebula is about 75 light-years across. The image shows an approximate complete ring shape, it does however appear very lopsided with one edge much brighter than the other. Near the center of the ring is a Wolf-Rayet star, a massive, hot, short-lived star that generates an intense stellar wind. Stars such as this tend to have powerful winds that sweep up surrounding interstellar material.\r\nImaged at El Sauce (Obstech), Chile in Narrow Band SHO , OTA RiDK 700. \r\n\r\nImage Processing: Roberto Colombari  Mike Selby \r\nSystem control Software: Voyager byLeonardo Orazi",
