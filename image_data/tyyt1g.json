    "description": "I wanted to give it one more try on this beautiful galaxy this year with an OSC. The colour balance is much better and the star colours look better than last year's attempt with a mono; but then again it could be the seeing conditions. \r\nI also wanted to see if I could get the same SNR and Signal to noise ratio with an OSC vs mono CCD with the same exposure time (bortle 6-7 sky). It seems that the same amount of exposure time is needed, so no cutting corners here :-)",
