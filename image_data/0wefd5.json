    "description": "This is a very interesting area in the Taurus Molecular Cloud featuring many dark and reflection nebulae. The main subject in the center is Barnard 7 (the dark nebula) and LBN 782 (the blue reflection nebula). To the left side is vdB 27, illuminated by RY Tauri, a young variable star. To the right is another reflection nebula illuminated by variable star CW Tauri. Peeking through the dust 186 million light years away is the galaxy IC 359, in the bottom right. All in all, a lot of different things to see here!\r\n\r\nThis has been my hardest image to process to date, and to be honest I'm still not quite happy with it, but I've reached the point where you can only keep doing it over so many times without getting any better, so here it is!",
