    "description": "This combines archive data with a new run using kit jointly owned with Steve and Lis Milne and Tom O'Donoghue. Dual TEC140 on Mesu 200.  Atik 460: RGB 9x15mins per channel, Ha 7nm 15x20 mins, OIII 4x20Mins and 21x15 mins. Moravian 8300, Lum 31x10 Mins, Ha 5nm 21x15 mins.\r\n\r\n(Some of these exposure times arose from calibration file difficulties which remain to be understood...)\r\n\r\nIn the end I only used the luminance over the main feature because the RGB stars were the tightest. Holding down the stars is the hardest part of this target in my view. We had a lot of colour and I made the most of it. If it's too much for your taste I quite understand! The image is a crop.",
