    "description": "This is an image of a complex of many nebulae all in one pretty picture, the most prominent features here are the Bow like structures and also the flare of blue and red nebulae scattered across the vast ocean of millions of stars here. If the camera had more pixels these stars would be more vivid. The Nebulae is quite large around 100 light years across and contains many Dark squiggles also known as dark matter nebulae yet to be fully explained. With so many ballistic super explosions going on here the gases are simply exotic creating all sorts of dynamic shapes & colors. The nebulae is appx 5000 light years away and is not a very popular structure for imaging as it is quite faint. The power of my Hyperstar lens and extra sensitive camera has brought most of it's mysteries out for us to explore only for a short while. In a billion years from now the shapes would completely have changed but space is timeless and forever ongoing with no endâ€¦",
