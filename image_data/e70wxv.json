    "description": "Such an interesting galaxy and so big and bright too!  The drawback is it doesn't get very high, even at 32 degrees north.  Another bonus is the large amount of HII and when blending, one has to be a bit careful to not let it swamp the image.  L 70x120s, RGB 28x80s 2x2 binned, HII 15x150s 2x2 binned.",
