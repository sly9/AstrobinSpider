    "description": "The Southern Pinwheel Galaxy has a Magnitude of 7.54, making it one of the brightest barred spiral galaxies our the sky.  This is a massive grand design spiral and is about one half the size of our galaxy, The Milky Way.  Grand design spiral is an appropriate name for this classification.\r\n\r\nIt occupies an area of 12.9 X 11.5 arcmin of the sky, but the presentation and orientation of M83 really couldn’t get any better.  I can look and explore the details of this galaxy for extended periods.  It has well-defined arms containing very active and bright Ha areas.  Tiny wispy threads are visible at the ends of the galaxy arms.  If you look carefully, dark vanes present within the dimmest parts.  And, to top it off, the many tiny galaxies distributed throughout really complete the scene.   Yep, it’s been on my todo list for years, and hopefully, I have done it justice.\r\n\r\nThere is another treat, a very faint tidal stream.  This would be the glowing area on the far left.  I checked with Simbad, and it’s there, bearly.  Conner Matherne recently posted his version of this incredibly faint stream of material that is in an arc, away from the main body of the galaxy.  It was an interesting puzzle on how to tackle the problems of revealing such a faint feature next to a very bright galaxy.  The most challenging part was dealing with what appears to be a dip in luminosity around the galaxy.    \r\n\r\nInstruments Used:\r\n•10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\n•Astro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\n•SBIG STL 11000m\r\n•FLI Filter Wheel\r\n•Astrodon Luminance, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\n•Baader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nAcquisition Details\r\n•Luminance  35 X 900 seconds\r\n•Ha  36 X 1200 seconds\r\n•Blue   12 X 900 seconds\r\n•Green  8 X 900 seconds\r\n•Red  7 X 900 seconds\r\nTotal Time: 27.5 Hours",
