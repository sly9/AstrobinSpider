    "description": "Sh2-124 is an emission nebula located in the constellation of Cygnus around 8, 500 light years away. It is a faint target, rarely imaged. It appears to be like SH2-125 (the Cocoon Nebula), which is in the same area, however it does not have the reflection you see around the Cocoon, so I thought this was perfect for narrowband. OIII was pretty tough, but was able to pull it out. There is a very tiny planetary nebula in the upper left corner if you can find it.",
