    "description": "I fit two different planetary nebulae into this same frame.  Heckathorn-Fesen-Gull 1 (HFG1) is a planetary nebula in Cassiopeia.  It was produced by a binary star system and discovered in 1982. The small circular bubble, Abell 6, is also a planetary nebula.  It's diameter is around 3 arc minutes in the sky.\r\n\r\nIt's captured with narrowband filters. I put Ha in the Red Channel and OIII in the Green and Blue Channels.  \r\n\r\nAll of the data was captured in October and November, 2019.\r\n\r\nAstronomik Ha: 285x240\" (gain: 139, offset: 21)\r\nAstronomik OIII: 308x240\" (gain: 75, offset: 15)\r\n\r\nIntegration: 39.53 hours",
