    "description": "NGC 6744 is classified as an intermediate spiral galaxy and has a similar structure to the Milky Way.  It’s located in the southern constellation Pavo at a distance of about 30 million light-years.  The low surface brightness of this galaxy requires long exposures to reveal the wonderful structures near the core and along its arms.   The similarities with our own galaxy include the elongated core, flocculent (fluffy) arms, and a similar companion galaxy NGC 6744A, similar to one of the Magellanic Clouds in our own galaxy.   The arm on the top left is most likely distorted by this companion galaxy.  NGC 6744 is a member of the Virgo Supercluster. \r\n\r\nThis image was created from exposures taken through five different filters.  The RGB component was used to create the base colour layers.  Details of the galaxy and its core were revealed with the luminance filter.  Finally, Ha highlights the presence of emission nebula throughout the galaxy. \r\n\r\nEven after their long journey, the photons captured have revealed a beautiful galaxy with integrate structures near its core as they were some 30 million years ago in the past.   This is perhaps the main reason why I enjoy this hobby so much.  To be in a position where I can take incredible images from objects so far away.  The time taken for light to reach us is almost unimaginable.  It's really nice to have my own time machine that allows observing objects as they were millions of years ago.\r\n\r\nEquipment Details:\r\n•10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\n•Astro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\n•SBIG STL 11000m\r\n•FLI Filter Wheel\r\n•Astrodon LRGB Filters\r\n•Baader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\n•Red 15X600\r\n•Green 18X600\r\n•Blue 23X600  \r\n•Lum 47X900  \r\n•Ha 41X1200\r\nTotal time: 33.4 hours\r\n\r\nThanks for looking",
