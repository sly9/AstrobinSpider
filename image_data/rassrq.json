    "description": "M96 in Leo is the next of the Messier catalogue objects on my list. At a distance of 31 million light years in the constellation of Leo this is similar in size to our own galaxy, containing about 100 billion stars. Although the sizes are similar, there are some interesting differences. The spiral arms are not as well developed, and there's a lot of asymmetry suggesting gravitational interactions with other galaxies.",
