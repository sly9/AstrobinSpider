    "description": "Another from an evening of lunar work from January 21st (Jan 22 GMT).  Freshly cleaned and collimated SCT and seemingly, very nice seeing conditions.\r\n\r\nWe have a view in this image from Archimedes to Eratosthenes with the Montes Apenninus.  Certainly among the more dramatic regions of the lunar surface and especially beautiful with the relief revealed by the shadows of dawn.  I particularly like the appearance of Timocharis just beginning to be illuminated.\r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy this lunar vista...  Clear Skies and Good Health",
