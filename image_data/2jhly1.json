    "description": "This barred spiral galaxy is in the constellation of Eridanus and is  a member of the Fornax Cluster. It has a number of dwarf companion galaxies, with NGC 1531 vividly appearing in this image. The two galaxies are interacting gravitationally and you can see the resulting plumes stretching between them. \r\n\r\nNGC 1532 is a “peculiar” galaxy, appearing in the Catalog of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and Associations, by Halton Arp and Barry Madore. It meets the criteria for three different categories of peculiar galaxies:\r\n\r\nCategory 1—Galaxies with Interacting Companions\r\nCategory 8—Galaxies with Apparent Companions\r\nCategory 10—Galaxies with Peculiar Spiral Arms\r\n\r\nTech Notes for ASA 500/3.6:\r\nASA Newtonian, 500 mm aperture, 1900mm focal length, F3.6\r\nFLI Proline 16803, 9 mm pixel, 4096 X 4096\r\nASA DDM85 equatorial mount\r\nProcessing with PixInsight, StarTools, and Affinity Photo",
