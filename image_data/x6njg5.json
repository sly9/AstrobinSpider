    "description": "Last night, after failing to shoot Venus (Terrible seeing, probably heatplumes from roof tops), I ended up shooting Lunar images. The initial set were all having high clouds and with IR685 filter, it was stable enough. I was getting about 16FPS without using ROI mode. I got few 4 minute shots .\r\n\r\nThis is a mosaic of 3 images but I have a hole on the bottom right.. strategically used for info card.\r\n\r\nI had to look up the names of these features (Not really very familiar with Moon's regions) and it is facinating to see the amount of details on the surface. This has been an enjoyable process. I have few more videos to process.",
