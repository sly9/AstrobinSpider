    "description": "Three years in the making  this five-pane mosaic image shows the beautiful region around the Constellation Orion.\r\nFrom the left the main features are the Witches Head, the Orion Nebula, Flame and Horsehead nebulae, Barnards Loop and the Rosette and Cone nebulae.\r\n\r\nThis particular image is my third attempt which consists of 18 months worth of image capture  (previous versions being 8 and 7 panes using a mono camera and filters).  COVID-19 and 6 months of cloud around where I live greatly hampered my acquisition efforts.\r\nMostly  the data was captured from my Bortle 4 home, with some acquired from a Bortle 2 dark site 2.5 hours away (to escape the clouds)\r\n\r\nEquipment Used : I run a dual camera arrangement consisting of ZWO ASI294MC-Pro with a Sigma 85mm F/1.4 Art Lens as well as a CentralDS astro-modified and cooled Canon 6D coupled to a Samyang 135mm F/2.0 lens.  \r\n\r\nCapture method & Software used :  12.5 hours of the best selected data acquired over an 18 month period via two simultaneous sessions of Sequence Generator Pro.  Integration, light pollution removal and mosaic stitching performed in AstroPixelProcessor.  Final editing in PixInsight and Adobe Photoshop.",
