    "description": "NGC 7822 is a young star forming complex in the constellation of Cepheus. It's also called Cederblad 214.  I was only able to image the interior of the complex due to my pixel scale. I took the frames spread over 3 nights due to the clouds rolling in each time. November 26, 28, and 29 2020.",
