    "description": "Saturn 2017\r\nFirst acceptable result on Saturn on a mid-night sight, I have nothing to complain about since I believe I'm starting in good style.\r\nSecond largest planet in the Solar System and the second largest \"owner\" of moons: Saturn and its 62 natural satellites are not easy to unravel, but some spacecraft and spacecraft have already brought us many answers about the gaseous planet. In terms of atmospheric composition and rotation, it is quite similar to Jupiter and precisely for this reason it was baptized with the name of the father of the god Jupiter in Roman mythology.\r\n\r\nIts core, it is believed, is composed of rocks, but the planet is basically surrounded by helium and hydrogen and does not have a solid surface. Its hue is yellow and the famous rings, first observed by Galileo Galilei in 1610, are a great mystery apart: there are theories about their origin, but none of them have been confirmed for the time being.\r\n\r\nFour ships have already passed through the planet and the last one, which arrived in 2004, still produces studies and analyzes on Saturn and its moons, in addition to the Cassini spacecraft, which began operations in 1997 and is due to retire in 2017.",
