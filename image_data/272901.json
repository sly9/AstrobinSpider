    "description": "Here we have classic M42, the \"Kraft cheese\" of Nebulas. \r\n\r\nSo named because everyone has one or wants to have one and it's a time honoured rite of passage in AP.\r\n\r\nNeverless, in spite of there being 35,000+ versions of this thing on the web, I havn't attempted this with my current gear, and it's big, bold and beautiful so heck, why not? \r\n\r\nI'm going to attempt to do my usual subtle NB take on it  \r\n\r\nLots of dust & gas up there, hoping to get 20+ hrs on it if the weather gods permit.\r\n\r\nHere's a sneak preview - taken from my backyard in Melbourne, Australia.\r\n\r\nThis is 6hrs of 1800 sec subs, 30mins of 300sec subs and just 6 mins of 60sec subs were individually stacked in Startools.\r\nThen combined in PS using layers/masks, and finessed with NIK SilverFX pro. \r\nStill lots of work ahead methinks \r\n\r\nThanks for looking, Cheers\r\n\r\nAndy",
