    "description": "Beating in the body of the mythical queen of Aethiopia, Cassiopeia, is the Heart Nebula. Nearly 200 light-years across and 7,500 light-years from Earth, this bright emission nebula spans about 2 degrees of the night sky, an area about four times the diameter of the full Moon. The young, massive star cluster at the center of the Heart energize the surrounding gases dominated by hydrogen, with lesser measures of oxygen and sulfur.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus in this project, the planetary nebula, WeBo 1, is also present beneath the Heart in the bottom right of the frame. It is a peculiar object with a young barium star surrounded by a ring-like planetary nebula.\r\n\r\nThe night sky has been blanketed by marine overcast for the last two months. While I know that it is coming every summer, I still find the inability to collect data frustrating. Fortunately for me, I am a “packrat” and have a 5-terabyte drive filled with data collect over the last few years. This image came from those data, collected in the fall of 2019. I was fortunate to have three night in a row of clear skies and collected nearly 30 hours of data in total, 20 hours of which was excellent Ha data with HFR ranging from 1.8 – 2.2.",
