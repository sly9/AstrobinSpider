    "description": "This is one of my most challenging targets so far.\r\n\r\nThis image includes the reflection nebulae VdB 7 and VdB 9 and also several dark nebulae. Vdb 7  (lower right) lies in proximity of RZ Cassiopeiae. The nebula is located just to the left of this star. The illuminating star however is not RZ Cassiopeiae, but a much weaker star, of eleventh magnitude. Regarding VdB 9, its illuminating star is the fifth magnitude SU Cassiopeiae, a white-yellow dwarf Cepheid, at a distance of about 1,400 light-years from Earth",
