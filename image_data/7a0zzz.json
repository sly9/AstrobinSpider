    "description": "Captured from Deep Sky West's southern facility in Chile.\r\n\r\nNGC 1532 is a nearly edge-on, deformed barred spiral galaxy about 180 thousand light-years across. It is located about 55 million light-years away from Earth and appears in the southern constellation of Eridanus (the River). It may possess several dwarf companion galaxies, a few that can be seen in the field of view, but is most likely interacting with the nearest neighbor, NGC 1531.\r\n\r\nNGC 1531 â€“ the small background galaxy with a bright core that lies just right of NGC 1532 is a lenticular dwarf galaxy of about 20,000 light-years across. The two galaxies exert enough gravitational pull on each other to cause NGC 1532 to became distorted. One of its spiral arms sticks out like a backwards check mark.  It is believed that over time the gravitational interaction of the two galaxies will tear the smaller galaxy apart and merge its remains with the larger one.\r\n\r\nL - 24x600\r\nR - 18x600\r\nG - 15x600\r\nB - 17x600",
