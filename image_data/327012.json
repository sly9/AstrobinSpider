    "description": "This object is a faint dwarf elliptical galaxy located 2 million light years away in the constellation of Cassiopeia.  It is a small satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy.  This galaxy, with a diameter of 11,000 light years, is about the same size as nearby NGC 147 and likely revolves around it as a binary system.  I posted an image of NGC 147 last week on this site.  M31 and its four brightest companions (NGC 147, NGC 185, M32, and M110) are all members of the Coma-Sculptor Galaxy Cloud.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting aspect of this galaxy to me is the dark dust patch visible near the core, which appears to be very similar to the dark dust patches visible near the core of M110, its neighbor.",
