    "description": "My version of the NGC 3521 Galaxy.\r\n\r\nAcquisitions by <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/gturgeon/\">Greg Turgeon </a>  (@gregturgeon_astro), who has graciously provided it as the second part of a contest, thanks a lot Greg ! :)\r\n\r\nThe first phase of the contest consisted in processing an image of the \"pencil nebula\" (NGC 2736) ; the 10 best images beeing selected by a jury. Having been lucky enough to have <a href=\"https://astrob.in/zeh38t/0/\">my image selected </a>, I also had the chance to process this image of the galaxy NGC 3521 ! :)\r\n\r\nThis floculent spiral galaxy lies in the constellation of Leo, and is distant about 35 millions LY. \r\n\r\nSetup :\r\nTelescope: Planewave 17‚Äù CDK - Camera: FLI ML16803 - Filters: Chroma LRGB 8nm - Mount: 10 Micron GM3000 - Location: DSW, Chile\r\n150 x 300s (12,5h)\r\n\r\nLRGB version - Processed with Pixinsight & Photoshop\r\n\r\nSome details about the process : classical processing of the individual images, gradient removal on each layer, star reduction on each layer, noise reduction on linear images, deconvolution on Luminance layer, maskedstretch histogram editing for R, G & B layers, Luminance layer : mix of a classical log+histogramm & maskedstretch histogram editing, HDR composition on Luminance layer and blend with original luminance layer, PhotometricColor Calibration for RGB layer, color adjustements, boost of color saturation, assembly in LRGB, noise reduction on non-linear images, slight highlight of the halo of the galaxy with dedicated mask, final color and saturation adjustments on Photoshop.\r\n\r\nI have to say that the color calibration was a bit challenging, I made many attemps in order to have a quite decent result ! :)\r\n\r\nHope you will like it ! :)\r\n\r\nJB\r\n\r\nEDIT (04/05/2021) : I am pleased to complete this presentation because I was privileged to have this image selected as the winner of the contest! It is obviously a great honor and a great pleasure! Thanks again to Greg Turgeon and all the members of the jury; and congratulations to all the participants! :)",
