    "description": "The Stars of Orion - 300 image mosaic in the making. \r\n\r\nTen more panels making it 20 total with 17 left to edit.  I had a big season transitioning to dual scopes and I’m posting this one ahead of finishing out to Betleguese. I’m on a mission to make it to Betleguese before Orion sets for the year but Weather will play a big part. I’ve got roughly five hours a night left until March. It’s going to be tight.   Regardless, I am on track to finish at least 25 panels this season,\r\nMaybe even 13 more if I get the time. It’s worth noting I got 3 before switching to the dual scopes and 22 after with the week in Marathon Texas. If it has been clear all week\r\nfor us, I’d of finished this leg. \r\n\r\nIntegration per panel:\r\n\r\n12x3min L\r\n12x3min R\r\n12x3min G\r\n12x3min B\r\n\r\nAcquisition:\r\nSequence Generator Pro - Mosaic wizard Calibration in BPP per scope (Batch Pre Processing), integration with star alignment outside of BPP with the Star Alignment Tool, and processing with LRGB combination and photometric Color calibration applied per pane. \r\n\r\nLevels and exporting in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nEquipment:\r\n132 FLT William Optics x 2\r\nQHY 16200A CCD x 2\r\nAstrodon filters: LR in scope 1, GB in scope 2 \r\nAstro-Physics 1100 GTO \r\nQHY 5L-II on a 200mm WO Guide scope\r\n\r\nADM dual saddle with ADM robin Cassidy aiming device.",
