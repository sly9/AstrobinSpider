    "description": "What excellent sky conditions we have had this week in Houston, TX!  While I continue to collect data for my major summer project (a 20 panel mosaic of the veil complex) I have been sneaking in some of these open clusters that are quick targets.  I enjoy these star clusters because they require low integration time and are generally easy to process as long as I don't shoot them while the moon is in close proximity (which creates challenging gradients).  NGC 6819 lies on the boundary of Cygnus and Lyra.  I like how it hides subtly behind a few bright blue foreground stars and the gentle golden glow of the cluster itself.  Thanks for having a look.",
