    "description": "Its been a dismal year for imaging and I really havnt had a decent image using the CFF RC250 from Sydney. Self isolating at my dark site of course has benefits and a bit of Galaxy imaging is one of them. So many faint fuzzies.\r\n\r\nNGC4945 is in Centaurus, Mag 9.3 and a doddle to capture data for as its above the horizon for 18 hours at this time of the year.",
