    "description": "Decided to get my other two favorite targets from the southern hemisphere.  This was taken with a remote telescope so not much skill here for telescope setup but I did process the data :). \r\n\r\nThis supernova can only be seen from the southern hemisphere.  One day I'll head to Australia or New Zealand where I can take some of these targets in person.  For now I will settle for the remote telescope.\r\n\r\nThe Vela Supernova remnant is a Type II supernova, meaning that it is the result of a fast collapse of a massive star.  Similar to my Western Veil nebula this was taken with two narrowband filters, Oxygen iii, and Hydrogen Alpha.  Each is then mapped to a color with oxygen showing in blue and hydrogen showing in red.  The crazy thing about these really dark locations is that they don't take much time to collect data.  For my veil nebula I had to take 25 hours and over a week of work.  This thing is just 2 hours of data from this very dark sky site....",
