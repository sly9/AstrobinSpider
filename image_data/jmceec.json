    "description": "Interstellar dust clouds and bright nebulae abound in the fertile constellation of Orion. One of the brightest, M78, is near the center in this view, covering an area north of Orion's belt. At a distance of about 1,500 light-years, the bluish nebula itself is about 5 light-years across. Its blue tint is due to dust preferentially reflecting the blue light of hot, young stars in the region. Dark dust lanes and other nebulae can easily be traced through the gorgeous skyscape that includes many Herbig- Haro objects, energetic jets from stars in the process of formation.(text from APOD)\r\nOverall though, I'm happy with this image, I wanted more data (don't we always?) but was prevented by a minor technical glitch & then the thick bushfire smoke hanging over Australia at present. Nice to be out over dark skies again though!",
