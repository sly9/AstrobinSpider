    "description": "Went after M109 with my SCT 9,25 + a 0,63 reducer.  \r\nI tried something a little different on this one.  120 Lum,  60 each of RGB and all frames where 45 sec gain 300.\r\n\r\nThe scope is a little tricky to get good focus with, and then having 4 filters on top of that.  Probably the last pic with the big scope in a while. Now it's back to the little WO Zenithstar 61 for narrowband.",
