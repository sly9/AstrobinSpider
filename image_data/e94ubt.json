    "description": "There are objects, which are more interesting captured in narrowband technique. I think NGC 6888 is one of them. So I worked on that target again  but with a wider field to include that nice soap bubble nebula as a HOO pic. For green I mixed H alpha to 25% and OIII to 75% to produce some more natural star colors. Hope you like it",
