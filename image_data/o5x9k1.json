    "description": "The Northern Trifid Nebula (NGC 1579 with IC 2067) is a reflection Nebula located in the Perseus constellation.Though the nebula itself is not a typical Ha emitting target  is \"backilluminated\" by a star (LkHÎ± 101) contributes a lot of the ionisating H-alpha radiation that produces the red color tones. \r\n\r\nThe northern Trifid is a good target for mid winter. I shot it very late with the moon hunting me and needed 7 evenings from 2021-02.21 to 2021-03-06 to gather enough light for this image. The total imaging time is about 9.7 hours.\r\n\r\nASI2600mmp and TS Photoline 130/910 mm",
