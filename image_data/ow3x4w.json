    "description": "This is my first narrowband attempt with the ASI1600. I am still learning the star removal -> process -> star replacement technique, but I think the stars look pretty good here, even if they are not RGB.\r\n\r\nI had the camera cooled to only 0c to avoid any condensation. I can probably go below that temperature next time.",
