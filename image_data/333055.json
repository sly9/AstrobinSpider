    "description": "NGC672 (top right) and IC1727 (bottom left) are a true interacting pair around 25 million light years distant in the constellation of Triangulum.    The effects of the previous interactions are apparent in the appearance of the galactic structure.   Though NGC672 classifies as a barred spiral, it is rather diffuse and indistinct.   Though I have to say, it looks pretty presentable when compared to it's neighbor, the amorphous blob.    Both galaxies show evidence of recurring star birth events which likely coincide with repeated close approaches between them. \r\n\r\nOne other interesting aspect of this image is the collection of three distant edge-on spirals.    All three of these are 450-500mly distant so are likely neighbors as well.  \r\n\r\nThe weather really limited the amount of integration time I could pull off with this one.   It was just one of those targets I parked on when I had to kill some time.   I started doing that in November!    Since it's getting in the way of finishing other projects, I won't collect any more on it this year.  So, I processed what I had .... which was way less than I usually have.    \r\n\r\nAs always, enjoy!",
