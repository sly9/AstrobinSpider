    "description": "A composite of two images to scale taken minutes apart.\r\n\r\nNon-astronomical note:\r\nIn parallel I took further photos and a short video before the two girls or guys felt asleep hanging on the power line. Bats have a cute face almost like a fuzzy little teddy bear. The left one pissed before s(he) slept. For this to do it turned up 180 degrees, completed its business and returned to sleeping position with a face as if nothing happened. Unfortunately, I failed to video the scene. It was truly funny. Wait... the power line crosses my vegetable garden.\r\n\r\nDear viewers in the southern hemisphere, please feel free to rotate the image 180&deg;.\r\n\r\nJuly 10th., Revision B:\r\nIf anybody is interested in the night life of bats, here is a 1-minute MP4 video (24MB):\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astropical.space/astrobin/bats.mp4\">View</a>",
