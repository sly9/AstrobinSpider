    "description": "This object where we can count the presence of very young stars in formation has been visited very little by astrophotographers and I was not sure what I could get from it. The Ha layer immediately sets the tone for what will emerge from it and even a weak presence of Sii let made it possible to bring some nuances to the colors. Overall here is an RGB combination which results in a colourful starry background.\r\n\r\nThe starless version offers an amazing perspective of this complex!",
