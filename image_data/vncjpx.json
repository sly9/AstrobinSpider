    "description": "KJPN8 is a bizarre polypolar planetary nebula in Cassiopeia. It is rarely imaged which is surprising given its close proximity to the Bubble Nebula. In fact, many have it in their field when the capture the Bubble Nebula but don't recognize it because it is so faint. The strange structure is thought to be the result of multiple periods of ejectate by a rotating binary core over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nImaging Camera: QSI640wsg\r\nImaging Scope: Celestron 9.25\"Edge HD at f/7\r\nGuide Camera: SX Lodestarx2\r\nMount: Avalon M-Uno Fast Reverse\r\nFilters: Astrodon Gen II LRGB\r\nExposure: 6 hours 5nm Ha, 9 hours 5nm Ha, 15 minute subs. 1 hours each L(binx1)RGB(binx2)60 second subs.\r\nCapture: APT\r\nProcessing: CCD Stack and PS CC\r\nDate: 6/25/20 6/29/20\r\nSky conditions: Below average seeing, bortle white skies, SQM 17.8 mag/arc-sec2\r\nLocation: My front driveway.
