    "description": "After months long trial and error, I unwillingly admit that it takes way too much time to collect enough O3 data from light polluted backyard. So I took the shortcut this time.  The one hour long solid O3 data from the club dark site could easily beat 30+ hours from my own backyard.\r\nI tried to explain to my 8yo what is Wizard but nothing could prevail the other name Harry Potter and Golden Snitch. Honestly I don't know how authoritative is that 'popular' name other than seeing it on Stellarium or SkySafari. It doesn't matter, as the kid already started to tell me a story of one magician chasing the other falling one from the picture!",
