    "description": "My main target (will come as next image...) during the last clear sky period was only reachable for appr. 3,5h/night. So I could use rest of the time for imaging this tiny galaxy, which shows some nice structures which seems to be a cocoon... Spooky :-) \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the filterwheel of my CCD broke down, so that I missed finishing RGB and H-Alpha data. That was the point I decided to use my \"old\" DSLR to finish this project. So the color calibration was a little bit tricky for me...",
