    "description": "This is a reprocessing of one of my panels in my 4 panel mosaic of the Sadr region of Cygnus. I learned several new tricks and reprocessed it from top to bottom. It is so much better in several key ways that I classify it as a new image...or at least an image worth posting separately from my previous renditions. \r\n\r\nI went with a more dynamic color palette that includes greens, cyans, blues, reds, orange, yellow, and dark backgrounds. I used over a dozen color masks, GIMP, starnett++, and LocalHistogram Equalization. Thanks for looking!\r\n\r\nFor gear and exposure data, please see my other Butterfly nebula picture.",
