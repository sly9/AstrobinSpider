    "description": "Well, I am now officially running out of subs after the nice weather period we had here. This is the last one of my images taken over the last two weeks.\r\n\r\nHere my attempt on M101. It is featured in AstroPixelProcessors Tutorial section: <a href=\"https://www.astropixelprocessor.com/community/tutorials-workflows/star-color-calibration-1-58-completely-red-now/\">[Sticky] Star Color Calibration 1.58</a> (I couldn't get the star colors right in the beginning)\r\n\r\nSo great to see real world physics embedded in Astrophotography ... I love the star colors now that I found out how to correctly use the color calibration tool. \r\n\r\nSecond attempt this year on the Pinwheel. Now with some proper integration time! Love SGPro for letting me sleep :) So many galaxies to see on this one, really great to see what some 16ish hours can do on a little scope.\r\n\r\nAlso another one of my series \"been there before last year\": <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/299042/G/?image_list_page=3&nc=&nce=\">M101 by Frank Schmitz</a>",
