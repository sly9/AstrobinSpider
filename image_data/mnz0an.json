    "description": "Have always been head over heels for this galaxy, so happy to finally have a completed image of it! This was definitely a tough one to get working due to some high noise levels on the current sensor. However, hopefully those will be remedied soon for future images to make bringing out super faint structures like this jet a bit easier. One thing I am definitely disappointed in though is the sharpness of this set up. This scope combined with those small pixels and excellent seeing have made for a stupendously sharp image of this object. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking! :)",
