    "description": "This is a 'work in progress' image as we gather the data for a HOORGB image which will take a couple of seasons to gather the necessary data.  The four panels have the minimum data really to produce this test image and we do in fact have two further panels for a row across the bottom of the image but as yet no data!  This target is low even at e-Eye's latitude and so imaging in the turbulent lower atmosphere we are relieved to see little distortion and refraction effects on the RGB channels for the stars.\r\n\r\nI have wanted to image this very pretty target for some time and am delighted we have persevered sufficiently for an HaRGB image.  So I am pleased to add my version to the many fine Seagull (or Parrot) Nebula images posted recently.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne.\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking & CS to you all!",
