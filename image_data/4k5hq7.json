    "description": "This image, IC2167 and IC2169 Located in the Constellation of Monoceros isn’t as popular as its neighbor the cone nebula. It’s not as often imaged yet it is full of dark nebula (LDN1605 LDN1606 and LDN1607) and of course the blue reflection nebulas scattered about the area. It is approximately 2500 light years from earth.",
