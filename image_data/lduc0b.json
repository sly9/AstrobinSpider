    "description": "My absolutely favorite DSO, the lenticular galaxy M104 in the constellation Virgo! This was imaged over two nights with one of the Newtonians (T3) at ChileScope with a total integration time of only 4.3h. \r\n\r\nI was able to spot a bright asteroid (+14.5 mag) in the files from the second night, which turned out to be the asteroid 1145 Robelmonte. The GIF shows the movement of the asteroid over a time interval of approximately 2h.",
