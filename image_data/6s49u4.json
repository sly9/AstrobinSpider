    "description": "Here is the well-known Iris Nebula, NGC7023, which floats about 1300 light years away.\r\n\r\n It is a reflection nebula.  The central star carved out a pocket in the immense brown dust cloud and now illuminates it from within. We see the reflected starlight here in blue.\r\n\r\nI’d say this is definitely the best look I’ve been able to get so far. Enjoy!",
