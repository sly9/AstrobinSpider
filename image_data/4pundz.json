    "description": "This interesting and beautiful galaxy was my main object that night. After the distraction from the great seeing and the moon, I startet with 3 min subs. When the moon was lower, I switched to 5 min and let it run till dawn. It was very cold -10Â°C brrrrðŸ˜¬, but the good thing is, less noise in the image.ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\nI already have all the parts to build a cooling system for my dslr, before it's getting warm again.",
