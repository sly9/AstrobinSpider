    "description": "This is an HaSHO version of my recent \"propeller mistake\".   I like the bicolor version a lot so I posted this on its own so as not to bury the bicolor.  This region is endlessly fascinating no matter the framing or focal length used.  Not 100% convinced I don't need more OIII and especially SII data for this image, mostly to reduce noise, but also to improve signal strength.  the OIII is exceedingly faint in this FOV and the SII is pretty faint as well.",
