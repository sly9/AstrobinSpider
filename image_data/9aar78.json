    "description": "The  photo  represents a vast area of sky in the constellation of the Swan and includes numerous nebulae such as the Crescent, the Tulip, the nebular complex of Ic 1318, the Propeller nebula, the small blue reflection nebulae Ngc 6914 and covers about 16 degrees by 8 degrees.\r\nThe photo is a mosaic of 3 panels taken using the filters Ha, OIII, R, G, B. I used for the shooting   my new purchase, the Samyang 135mm f / 2.0 that really surprised me with its quality as I was able to use it setting the aperture to f / 2 and f / 2.8. The Crescent and the Ngc 6914 were made with the Skywatcher  ED 80 refractor in 2x2 binning to get some more details.\r\nIn the elaboration I highlighted out the weakest structures of the nebulae producing therefore a final result, in terms of details, very similar to the black and white photo that comes out of the H alpha file once it has been made a stretch but with in addition also the colors of the very few nebulae that appear using the OIII filter (WR 134 Ring Nebula, the external parts of the Crescent, the Soap Bubble and the traces of nebulosity on a star in the right area of the photo quite close to 2 bright stars, one  blue and one yellow.",
