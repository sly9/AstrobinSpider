    "description": "I just returned from holidays on La Palma (Canaries) which is one of the top places for astronomy. I had the chance to visit the Gran Telescopio Canaria during the day which was awesome and to do some astro imaging during the night time under a bortle 2 sky. This is the first image I have taken showing the Rosette Nebula.  It was the first time I used the RedCat 51 refractor with the ASI 1600 MM which is a nice setup for travelling. \r\nHope you like the image.",
