    "description": "Cygnus is a rich field of objects for we Northern imagers.  I wanted to try and target one of the less often seen nebulae, but also gain some long FL data that I could also use for blending with a wide-field image I'm shooting from the backyard.  \r\n\r\nI shot this with SHO filters, however the blend is Ha as luminance and an S-O bi-color for the color.  The Ha is very strong here while the OIII is weak so the SII was a better match for the color channel.\r\n\r\nNebula processing was done starlessly with the narrowband stars added back later.  Star removal used Starnet++ to identify the stars and Photoshop's fill function to replace them.   Noise reduction with Topaz De-Noise AI.   Sharpening and contrast adjustments via High Pass and Unsharp filters.",
