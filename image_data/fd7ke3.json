    "description": "NGC 253 : the Sculptor galaxy\r\n\r\nIt is located 11 million light-years away in the constellation Intermediate Spiral Sculptor (SABc). It is probably the most visible Galaxy in the sky after the Andromeda galaxy, easily observable with binoculars.\r\nIt is physically associated with the group of galaxies called The Sculptor's Filament (or Sculptor Group) of which it is the most massive member This group is one of the closest groups of galaxies to the Milky Way. The nucleus of this galaxy is probably home to a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of 5 million solar masses (Seyfert galaxies)\r\n\r\nNGC 253 is a prototypical active star forming galaxy, or starburst galaxy. Starburst, or baby boom, galaxies have been the major drivers of star formation and galaxy evolution throughout the whole history of the Universe. Therefore it is crucial to understand what exactly is going on in the heart of such galaxies.",
