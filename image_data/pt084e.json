    "description": "NGC 5426 and NGC 5427 (Arp 217)\r\n\r\nESO selected this galaxy pair as their final image captured on their Very Large Telescope (VLT) before decommissioning their VIMOS instrument in 2018...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://scitechdaily.com/vimoss-final-image-interacting-galaxies-ngc-5426-and-ngc-5427/\">VMOS's Final Image on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT)</a>\r\n\r\nI was curious to see what's possible if the telescope is fairly large, but not VERY large. (-:\r\n\r\nThis galaxy pair is relatively small in my FOV, so I processed with 2X drizzle for maximum resolution. Current 21.5+ SQM skies with 1.8\" average FWHM on 15 minute subs also helped a bit. (-;\r\n\r\n120 Million Light Years distant.\r\n\r\nBTW, is that a very distant \"M82\" at the upper left?",
