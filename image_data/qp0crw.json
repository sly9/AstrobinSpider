    "description": "M1 - The Crab Nebula (HOO)\r\n\r\nFirst time shooting this beautiful supernova remnant. This one was really cool to capture. Shooting narrowband everything starts off in greyscale... Even without color this was so incredible to see appear on my screen with all of the fine gassy intricate details.
