    "description": "This image was a real challenge for me but was rewarding to image and process.  I hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost Nebula is a reflection nebula that has several stars embedded within the nebula. These stars give the nebula an eery brown color. The nebula itself consists of numerous Bok globules - areas where the dust and gas is condensing to form protostars. The dark nebula to the right of vdb 141 is LDN 1435. Within this nebula is a Herbig Haro object known as HH 157 which is probably a binary star system in formation. \r\n\r\nAlso known as Sh2-136, the Ghost Nebula is about 2 light years across and 1200 light years away. The surrounding nebulosity is uncatalogued, although these dust clouds are pervasive throughout the constellation of Cepheus.",
