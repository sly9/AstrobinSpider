    "description": "This section of the Vela Supernova Remnant is made up of 2 panes shot using the TOA-150 refractor and FLI ML16200 camera located in El Sauce Chile.  This target was a very difficult one to process.  I must have thrown everything away and restarted 5 times. The detail is more faint than you would think making it very difficult to bring out the color and detail that I imaged before I started.\r\n\r\nHats off to the PixInsight team for the development of the MosaicByCoordinates script.  In my previous mosaics I used the StarAlignment tool to attempt to put the individual frames together.  This always seemed like a kludge and I typically struggled with images that were 1 pixel too wide or too long that would refuse to combine.  The MosaicByCoordinates script is AWESOME!!!  It took a bit longer to run, but it was perfect.  I can't believe that I didn't know this thing was there (I'm sure it has been for a while, I just didn't know it).  The reason that I mention it here is in case there are others out there that are also unaware of its existence.  The documentation for it was great and I had no problems using it.  My individual channel mosaics were done with a few ticks of the clock and zero frustration.\r\n\r\nC and C always welcome!\r\nTim.",
