    "description": "Reasonably dim and rarley imaged  IC1287 at the lower right. With the blue reflection nebula are a collection of Barnard Dark nebula, several SNR's and an open cluster all in the constellation Scutum. \r\n\r\nThe nebula is illuminated by athe magnitude 5.7 star near its center also in the field are B94, B95, B96, B97, B1000, B101 and the open cluster NGC6645 to the lower left. \r\n\r\nThis object would work well with longer focal length instruments. The focal length here is 550mm.\r\nI used Astrodon filters\r\n(12) R at 180 seconds\r\n  (8) G at 180 seconds\r\n  (9) B at 180 seconds \r\n  (9) Halpha  at 180 seconds. There isn't much HAlpha in the field\r\n\r\nImage B is an annotated Blue-channel for referencing some additional objects...\r\n\r\nNorth is to the left",
