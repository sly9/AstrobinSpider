    "description": "The Tadpole Nebula is an emission nebula in the constellation Auriga. The Tadpoles proper are rich in hydrogen and sulphur emissions and stand out against a background of mostly oxygen signal. \r\n\r\nTo create the starless version for processing of the narrowband data, I used the code Starnet by Nikita Misiura, folowed by clean-up in Photoshop CC. Reference: https://www.astrobin.com/339099/\r\n\r\nVersion A: Wide crop of the IC410 nebula region\r\nVersion B:  Tight crop of the Tadpoles\r\nVersion C: Starless image of IC410\r\nVersion G: No tone mapping. I decided to reprocess the data and was a more natural palette of colors starting from cross-blended SHO.\r\n\r\nAll data acquired with ZWO ASI1600MM Pro, Gain=139, Offset=50. 75% of acquired data was retained for processing (discarded subs were eliminated due to bad seeing or wind).",
