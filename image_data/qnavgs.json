I put it together and removed sharpening artifacts by using masks and moving detail of surface for main layer with minimal processing. That's why picture is smooth :)\r\n\r\nSeeing was extremely good taht day and also there was no wind - that's why I was succesfull with register a lot of detail - especially \"horseshoe\" shape of Phoebe Regio :)",
