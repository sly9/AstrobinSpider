    "description": "Looking at the color stacks of that dim beauty, it seems that this face on galaxy is not very colorful. It seems to be a dirty grey with some accents of yellow in the core. Magnificant instead are the stunning h alpha regions in the outer regions. So how to process? I decided for a not to bright version, so that you can see the bright stars in the foreground, the reason why it is barely able to be seen in a telescope and the dust between us and the galxy of course( hidden). Instead  the h alpha regions emphasized, which gives the whole thing some nice color. But that's just my idea of how it can look.",
