    "description": "This has been a struggle to acquire and process. \r\n\r\nMy original plan was to go deep on this target at high resolution.. However, during the time I had good seeing, the moon was large and bright and couldn't shoot any broad band (ended up shooting M1) and everytime I tried shooting L on this target, the seeing was terrible and I had to eke out subs out of multiple nights.  \r\n\r\nThe color data had horrible gradients as well as I did bad framing (or may be it was mirror flop and I had badly framed images as well that had to be discarded).  I pushed the processing as much as I could but it has fallen well short of my target. I will keep trying to collect data but the forecast isn't looking good and the target is going to hit meridian early before long (and I cant shoot past it).\r\n\r\nThe stars are big and fluffy.. cant do much about up ... If only I had some good seeing on moonless nights.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion B: Collected more L subs and threw out a bunch of less quality subs\r\nL - 162*3 mins\r\nR/G/B - 50/60/55 * 3min\r\n",
