    "description": "19 March 2018, wide conjuction of the Moon, Venus and Mercury.  In the foreground one of the 15 sculptures of the project Getij-dingen2018, placed on the beaches of Koksijde, only visible at low tide because at high tide the sculptures are under/in the seawater.  After 10 months one will be able to see the influence of seawater, wind and sand on these sculptures.\r\nThis sculpture is by Marc Vanhecke and is called Berten met de verrekijker (Bert with binoculars).",
