    "description": "Here's my final 2021 version of M81 and M82. \r\n\r\nPlease check the full view and zoom in for some actual details! :) \r\n\r\nThis is easily. My deepest exposure yet, clocking in at 80 hours.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting data was definitely the H-Alpha part. Not only does the apparently abundant hydrogen in M81's satellite galaxy, Holmberg IX show up, but also in the form of the \"Cap of M82\". \r\n\r\nI stumbled upon it after analysing my H-alpha data, and then found a couple of images featuring it after some research. I don't think it's been shown in this way before. Most images I found are very close up and don't feature the IFN in the same image.\r\n\r\nEither way, I'm pleased with this version. The stars, as always, are ugly... But I've decided to buy better filters, hope that'll fix it. I guess I might even have to go for spider vanes on top of the dew shield to get better star shapes. Let me know what you think! :)\r\n\r\nBy the way, the image wasn't 4800x60s.\r\n\r\nMore like H-Alpha: 1100x120s at Gain 11\r\nLuminance and RGB: 2600x60s at Gain 0",
