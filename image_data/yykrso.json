    "description": "It was interesting to see how deep I could go with 6 hours of luminance data from my suburban backyard. \r\n\r\nRev.B shows inverted luminance with annotations from the SDSS R9 catalog. I used the data from the Sloan G-band filter, since it covers a good part of the visible spectrum (400 - 530 nm). Additionally, objects were filtered to include only galaxies instead of stars.\r\n\r\nThe limiting magnitude of this image appears to be ~21.5, more than 1000 galaxies can be seen.\r\n\r\nUpdate 17 May: I found a quasar named 7C 121446.70+472852.00 on the right side of the frame (click see full size Rev. C, the quasar is annotated in white text). It looks like a magnitude 19.5 star but itâ€™s actually much, much further away. The redshift is 1.13 and according to the calculator below, this object lies 12 billion light years away! http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html",
