    "description": "Here we have a try at Kemble's Cascade (Kemble 1) which is an asterism located in Camelopardalis.  This one, much like the Double Cluster is a feast for the eyes visually and I wanted to try to capture that experience with this image.\r\n\r\nThis is a first-light with an Askar 72mm Petzval-like refractor.  I have been looking for a nice small refractor for a while, particularly a fast and fairly wide field instrument for the wide field and grab-and-go type of applications.  I had worked a little bit with an Apertura 60mm FPL-53 doublet but either that particular instrument has some problems or simply is not good enough to do what we do with these.  I think it it likely the former.  \r\n\r\nIn any case, using this was a pleasure and the data I was able to capture seems to be pretty good considering that we had the jet stream parked over Arizona for a while resulting in clear skies but poor seeing.  So it seemed that doing an image like this was the appropriate kind of object with these conditions.  I suspected that there might be a little bit of Hii in this area of the sky so I did a bit of Ha integration to see.  I think I caught a little bit of it so probably not a waste of time.\r\n\r\nI hope you like this one, comments/criticism always welcome and Clear Skies!",
