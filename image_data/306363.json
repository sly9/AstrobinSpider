    "description": "There aren't many galaxy groupings that were named after the location where an observer once enjoyed a good view, but this is one of them. NGC7331 is a beauty of a spiral galaxy and the group includes several other interesting galaxies. The smaller ones are almost 10 times more distant and its safe to say that NGC7331 steals the show here. \r\n\r\nNGC7331 is a spiral galaxy with an interesting property. The core of the galaxy has retrograde spin, which means it spins in a direction opposite from the outer arms! The core also appears somewhat off center. These properties lead you to believe something strange indeed happened in it's youth. \r\n\r\nThe image was captured after I reassembled my deep sky image train from a short planetary stint. I had some issues to work through and had to capture this in a couple cram sessions to beat the coming moon. I would have liked to give it a bit more time on RGB, but I finished this out with what I had. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
