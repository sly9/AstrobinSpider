    "description": "Spiral galaxy NGC 3718. This distorted galaxy is distinguished by distorted spiral arms and a dust lane wrapped across its center.\r\nFirst discovered by William Herschel in 1789 both NGC 3718 and the probable cause of its distortion NGC 3729 make a nice galaxy pair for northern observers. NGC 3729 also appears distorted but not as much as 3718 It appears that NGC 3718 could be evolving into a polar ring galaxy. The nucleus of NGC 3718 is not circular but definitely box shaped. Both 3718 and 3729 are classified as SB (barred spirals) but obviously they are both distorted from this basic designation.  3729 are about 40 million light years away.  Hope you enjoy",
