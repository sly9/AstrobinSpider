    "description": "M101 is a spiral galaxy 21 million light years away from us located in our night sky just above the end of the handle of the big dipper. M101 is a large galaxy coming in at 170,000 light years across and containing a whopping 1 trillion stars. Given this size and the fact that it is relatively close to us (in comparison to other large galaxies outside our local group) it appears fairly large in the night sky at 22 arcmin across and in fact I was unable to fit the entire galaxy in frame, including the outer bands of its loosely bound spiral arms with my Edge HD setup. The galaxy also has a large number of HII star forming nebulae regions that speckle its spiral arms which Iâ€™ve pulled out in this image by adding in a narrowband HII filter to the image.",
