    "description": "My goal with this project was to see how close I could get to the 2015 Hubble shot celebrating 25 years in orbit...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/the-pillars-of-creation\">Hubble Pillars of Creation</a>\r\n\r\nFortunately my Ha, OIII and SII filters are very close to those used by Hubble...\r\n\r\nBlue: F502N (OIII)\r\nGreen: F657N (HÎ± + NII)\r\nRed: F673N (SII)\r\n\r\n... so similar color was in sight. (-:\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge was to capture good Ha for detail. This uses 35 of my best 5-minute Ha exposures over several days. FWHM on Ha subs is between 1.7\" and 2.1\".\r\n\r\nAfter combining SII, OIII and Ha, uncolored Ha was added as a soft light layer to help with detail and contrast.\r\n\r\nMinor noise reduction was applied to SII and OIII. No noise reduction on Ha to help maximize detail.\r\n\r\nFinally, a very mild Unsharp Mask was applied over a cropped 2X Drizzle for additional detail.",
