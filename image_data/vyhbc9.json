    "description": "Barnard 150 dark nebula in Cepheus. It has the shape of a Sea Horse, swimming in the the celestial sea. I imaged this from my clubs dark site. While driving out to the site ( while it was still light out). I was hoping a lot of the high clouds would clear. Plus it was looking a little hazy. Once the Sun set and Astronomic Dusk came the sky did look better, but still the seeing was 6/10.\r\n    I also thought the Blue and red in the upper left corner was some kind of artifact. But I realized that it is nebulosity from the neighboring object Sh 2-129.\r\n I plan on getting more data on this object from the dark site. I really like this object.\r\n        Clear skies ,  Mike",
