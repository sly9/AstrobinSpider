    "description": "I present to you an image captured over the last 2 weeks because the sky in Quebec is rather cloudy these days. Please be indulgent because I had to temporarily remove my telescope from the mount and unfortunately some dust was moved and my flats are been taken after. This small pair of star clusters was a perfect target since the 2 clusters almost perfectly entered my field. Good viewing !",
