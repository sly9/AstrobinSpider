    "description": "The mysterious \"Crab Nebula\", otherwise known as M1 in the constellation of Taurus...shown here in natural color.  The Crab Nebula is a supernova remnant...the expanding guts of a star that blew off its outer layers in the year 1054 (our time) with only the collapsed core of the progenitor star left at its center. The explosion was so bright that it could be seen from Earth in the daytime and was documented by the Chinese and the American Indians. What remains at the center of this maelstrom is a \"neutron star\"...a relatively small body consisting of only neutrons caused by the crushing collapse of the atomic structure of the atoms making it up...pressured so strongly in the explosion that the electrons of the atoms in its core have been crushed into the proton atomic nuclei so that only neutrons remain. The collapse of the star also increased its speed of rotation greatly so that we now see it rotating at 30 revolutions per second...sending a beam of radio noise our way pulsating at 30 times per second...a \"pulsar\". When initially discovered in 1968, this regularly pulsing signal was thought to be of alien origin before the physics of the situation was understood and other pulsars found. The neutron star is also emitting strong X-rays, which are often used as a source to calibrate x-ray astronomy equipment.",
