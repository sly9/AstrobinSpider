    "description": "This object is a planetary nebula located 1200 light years away in the southern constellation of Fornax.  I find its look and shape to be very different from the other planetary nebulae I have imaged.  It has a 3-D, non-symmetric oblong appearance, swirling color and shading variations along its length, and subtle reddish matter at one end of its long axis. The bluish color is due to a mix of ionized oxygen and hydrogen gas, with oxygen being dominant.  The clearly visible central star is believed to be a Wolf-Rayet star, brighter and hotter than usual.",
