    "description": "As I mentioned my last post, this is a first light image with a new William Optics telescope that I am testing, the Fluorostar 91 (https://williamoptics.com/fluorostar-91). The FLT 91 is an Apochromatic refractor with a focal length of 540 mm and an aperture of f/5.9. Over a seven day period I was able to collect about 17 hours of good quality narrowband data (there was an 80-100% Moon during the collection period), including 8 hours of Ha subs with an HFR range of 1.6-2.2. My previous post of these data was an SHO rendition (https://www.astrobin.com/oq39mu/?nc=user). This is a “natural” palette version using these same data (use this link for a full description of my narrowband natural processing procedure, https://www.astrobin.com/0th11x/?nc=user, Version C). For this object, I prefer this “natural” look over an classic Hubble palette. What color palette do you favor?",
