    "description": "A couple months ago I had the plan to image the famous horsehead, however a single panel failed to include a lot of the interesting surrounding nebulosity and so I upped it to a 3 panel. \r\nOn top of that I decided to make it an HaLRGB image, I estimated roughly 11 hours per panel, 5 to Ha, 3 to L and 3 to RGB. In actuality it equated to 32.5 hours total!\r\nThis has been my most ambitious project yet, I spent over a month just acquiring the sufficient data, several days spent processing (9k x 4k images are slow on my computer)",
