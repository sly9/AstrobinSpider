    "description": "NGC 2359 is a bright emission and/or reflection nebula in Canis Major, nicknamed the Duck Nebula or (more popularly) Thor's Helmet.\r\n\r\nViewed through an O-III filter, this nebula is fairly bright, large (8' x 8'), and irregularly V-shaped with several obvious concentrations. The brightest lies at the southern end (lower part of the image), spreading west from a 9th magnitude star. Several filaments extend northward into a triangular asterism. Three 11th magnitude stars mark its northern edge, with a fourth 11th magnitude star at its southern vertex. The very faint planetary nebula, IC 468 (not shown), is attached at the NW end (right hand side).",
