    "description": "NGC 281 (the Pacman Nebula) is an 80 light-year diameter dust cloud some 10,000 light years away in the constellation of Cassiopeia.  The nebula was discovered by EE Barnard in August 1883.  \r\n\r\nContained within the cloud is the open cluster IC 1590.  \r\n\r\nNGC 281 contains a number of dark globules within which (it is believed) new stars are forming.  These are named Bok Globules after the Dutch-American astronomer – Bart Bok who first described these in the 1940s.\r\n\r\nNGC 281 was photographed from our home observatory in the UK between 6 and 25 September 2016.  Steve has previously presented his version, but this is my first attempt at producing a ‘Hubble Palette’ version with the data.\r\n\r\nCapture details:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Skywatcher Esprit 120\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon 3nm NB\r\nMount: Mesu 200\r\n\r\nHa: 15 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 15 x 1200s\r\nSII: 15 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 15 hours exposure.",
