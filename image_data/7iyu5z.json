    "description": "Another reflection nebula, this time in Taurus. I have seen very few renditions of this reflection nebula online. \r\n\r\nThe challenge with capturing and processing this nebula is obviously the bright star to the left - a lot of reflection coming from it which provides undue gradient in the image. \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, there is not a whole lot of red in this image - must be a region full of new and hot stars.\r\n\r\nAnother thing about this image - there are plenty of faint and small galaxies in this region. \r\n\r\nOh, the wonders of the Universe just don't cease to amaze!!!",
