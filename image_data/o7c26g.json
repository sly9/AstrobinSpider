    "description": "Mars with moons Phobos & Deimos - at opposition.\r\n\r\nTransparency was good, but seeing was quite poor and I couldn't get good photos of Mars, but the positions of the moons was perfect for capturing them.  Both moons were at the ends of their orbits farthest from Mars making them easier to capture.  I could see both in live view while taking the photos and stacking and wavelet processing brought out them pretty sharply.\r\n\r\n30 frames, 2.5 sec exposures, 120 gain",
