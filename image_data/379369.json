    "description": "M31 - Andromeda Galaxy shot remotely from my system in Marathon Remote Imaging Observatory (MaRIO) in Marathon, TX.\r\nThis image has been a bit of a pain for me. This should have been a single panel image but turned into a 2 panel mosaic. After processing the first panel data, I realized I had a pretty pronounced reflection on the right hand side. Bad enough that I was never going to be able to clean it up. So I had to shoot another panel with roughly the same integration time to mask back in the correct details. But I felt this image was worth it to gather the additional data and make it look right.\r\nI will enter in only the main data so I don't skew the numbers. Main image was 24.17 hours and the second panel was 20.83 hours for a total of 45 hours to capture this.\r\n\r\nSoftware used to capture image:\r\nSequence Generator Pro\r\nPHD2\r\n\r\nSoftware used to edit:\r\nPixInsight\r\nAstro Pixel Processor\r\nPhotoshop\r\n\r\nTotal data gathered:\r\nMain Panel: (145) Subs @ 600secs - 1x1 @ Gain 2200\r\nSecond Panel: (125) Subs @ 600secs - 1x1 @ Gain 2200\r\n\r\n\r\nCamera : QHYCCD QHY128C\r\nTelescope: Stellarvue SVQ86\r\nMount: AP Mach1GTO",
