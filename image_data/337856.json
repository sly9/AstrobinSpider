    "description": "A combination of data from Jim & Linda Powell's TEC 160FL at DSW, the Ceravolo 300 I share at SRO and data from the RCOS 14.5\" at DSW.  Total of about 50 hours LRGB and a little Ha.\r\n\r\nThe data from Jim & Linda is the backbone of the image.  At SRO we abandoned the target after only managing to collect Lum and Red before it got too late in the season.  The RCOS has a relatively small field of view so that data was used to add some detail to the centre of the image.\r\n\r\nSRO C300: captured at SRO Nov-Dec 2015 (only Lum and Red)\r\nDSW RCOS team: captured at DSW, Oct 2017 to Jan 2018\r\nJim & Linda Powell TEC 160FL: captured at DSW, Jan-Mar 2018\r\n\r\nAcquisition credit: Jim & Linda Powell, John Kasianowicz, Daniele Malleo, Leonardo Orazi, Rob Pfile, Rick Stevenson and Jerry Yesavage.\r\n\r\nProcessing & copyright: Rick Stevenson",
