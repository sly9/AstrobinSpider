    "description": "The Triangulum Galaxy is part of the local group and near enough to be resolved easily into single stars, at least the bigger stars. There are lots of HII regions, most prominently loopy NGC604 which is presented as a 100% crop. \r\n\r\nThe closeup was done with my Lacerta 10\" f/4 Photonewton, and as M33 proved a little too big to be fully covered I just pointed my Takahashi Epsilon130 along for a wider shot. Both are LRGB with ASI1600MMPro.",
