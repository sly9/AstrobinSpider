    "description": "NGC 2442 and NGC 2443 are two parts of a single intermediate spiral galaxy, commonly known as the Meathook Galaxy. It is about 50 million light-years away in the constellation Volans, and was discovered by Sir John Herschel on December 23, 1834. Associated with this galaxy is HIPASS J0731-69, a cloud of gas devoid of any stars. It is likely that the cloud was torn loose from NGC 2442 by a companion.
