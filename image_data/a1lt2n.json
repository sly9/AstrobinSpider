This is due to a perfect storm of errors I have since discovered in my new (2nd hand) OTA . The Tak reducer, Feathertouch Focuser & both adapters at each end were all unevenly out of round, not square and are progressively being re-machined to better than factory standards by my ASV colleague and telescope builder, Stefan Buda. Fingers crossed it will all be ok soon!",
