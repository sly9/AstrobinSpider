    "description": "This is a 16-frame mosaic. This time, I decided to go relative narrow-field with high resolution. The consequence is it is not very deep.\r\n\r\nThe original mosaic has 683 Mega pixel, and it's not practical to upload such a large image. The version uploaded here is a 25% reduction.\r\n\r\nAstrobin seems to have some problem displaying images at this moment. If you have trouble seeing this image, you can go to my Flickr page:\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/weihaowang/27315702327/in/dateposted/\r\nLarge file:\r\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/1/950/27315702327_0600c19cc4_o.jpg",
