    "description": "Annoying diffraction patterns.  i found my secondary was partially coated on the edges.  Might that have caused it?  Or maybe a pinched primary?  I have since removed the secondary entirely and replaced it with a 1.25\" focuser for a small camera.  I did a de-greened and denoised version but I didn't like it as much.  :)",
