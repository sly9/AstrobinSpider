    "description": "Decided to see if i could see any of this from my home site in semi rural Shropshire. Whilst the processing might be over done i haven't learned how to smooth this out and lose some of the granularity. \r\nSkies were poor seeing which may be half the problem but interested if anyone has any suggestions?\r\nThere are 125 x 300\" L, and 30 x 180\" each of RGB.\r\nthanks for looking\r\n\r\nWith thanks to wimvb for helpful suggestions for the stars.",
