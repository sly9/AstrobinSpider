    "description": "NGC 1808 is a barred spiral galaxy located 40 million light years from Earth in the constellation of Columba.\r\nWhile most spiral galaxies are flat disks this one has spumes of dust and gas on its outer spiral arms. The unusual shape may have been caused by a proximate encounter with another galaxy (NGC 1792). This is supported by the amount of gas moving towards the nucleus of NGC 1808 which has triggered a very high level of new star formation.\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\r\nSystem Control Software: Voyager by Leo Orazi",
