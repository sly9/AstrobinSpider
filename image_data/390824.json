    "description": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI've been doing astrophotography for a little over three years now. I think I have come a long way in that time and learned a lot. When my girlfriend recently asked me for an image of the orion nebula for a large sized print I though \"No, the old image wasn't too bad but you can do it better now\".\r\n(old image: https://www.astrobin.com/270901/)\r\n\r\nSo I got to work to create an image that is matching my current level of skill in this hobby. I want to share my result with you today.\r\nSince the Orion Nebula is the brightest nebula in the northern hemisphere it is the easiest and one of the toughest to image well. You definitely need to do HDR when you have a camera like me and you want to capture the core and outer faint nebulosity.\r\nThe weather really made this image a challenge as I had not a single clear night from mid of November to mid of January. But with enough patience I finally managed to get the ~16h of exposure time done.\r\n\r\nI opted for a different approach here and did not capture luminance but rather captured a lot of HA which I combined with a pseudo luminance from the RGB channels for the whole detail information. I'm still not sure if it was a good choice but I am happy with the final image. I hope you enjoy it :)",
