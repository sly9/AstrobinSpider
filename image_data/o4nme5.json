    "description": "Hi everyone, this was a first test with my brand new ZWO 7x2\" EFW, The first night I have some several issues of tilt in the imaging train due to the added wheight because the wheel and the 7 2\" filters, but I could solve it at least fot now for the second night.\r\n\r\nThat's the reason that I could only get 4 h of each channel, and the clouds appear, so Sii must wait for clearer nights. Also the Moon was full, so no best condition for photography, but I really wanted to try the filter wheel, and it is magical. Before the wheel I have to screw the filter in use on the thread of the coma corrector of my newton telescope, and for changing filter I have to take the camera out, unscrew one filter an screw the other one, for that reason I always did 1 channel for each night. Now I can get Ha, Oiii and Sii on the same night, this is a huge improvement in my setup.\r\n\r\nThe Image is a Bicolour image, mapping the colors was creating a synthetic green R:Ha, G:Ha*Oiii*1.3 and B:Oiii. \r\n\r\nHope you like it and stay safe.\r\n\r\nClear Skies, Ariel.",
