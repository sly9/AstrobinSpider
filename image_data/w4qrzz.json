    "description": "Hi, üëã‚ùÑ üååüå¨\r\n\r\nCategory: Panorama\r\n\r\nThe sacred image of Podlasie is a multitude of chapels along dirt roads, always at the crossroads. Shrines often have a companion, i.e. a tree. They were the borders of villages, they protected them from all evil, defeat, war and epidemics. Power was assigned to each such sacred place, along with the words of the prayer \"from air, hunger, fire and war, save us, Lord.\" In summer, seeing such places bathed in flowers, we have confirmation of the importance of the shrine. It's frosty today. Winter and crunchy snow. Taking 2 hours of photos, I noticed that the place does not protect against frost -18¬∞C‚ùÑ  . But who would care when looking at the stars in such a landscape of Podlasie. We have a hypnotic image in such a view of the sacredness and the sky, I perfectly understand why a roadside shrine in the middle of nowhere has so many properties. \r\n\r\nPodlasie, POLAND üáµüá± \r\nPanorama 16 x 15s ISO3200 @ f1.8 \r\nCanon EOS R mod Plus Sigma 28mm f1.4 ART  Tripod \r\n\r\nSocial:\r\nFB: ≈Åukasz ≈ªak ·¥æ·¥¥·¥º·µÄ·¥º \r\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/lukaszzak/",
