    "description": "The Soul nebula is such a large object that we could not fit it easily within a single frame of our remote Tak 106/QSI 683 'widefield' rig located at the e-EyE facility in Extremadura, Spain.  As such, this is a two-panel mosaic consisiting of 21 x 1200s each of SII, Ha and OIII per panel - a total of 42 hours.  Data were captured between 19 November 2017 and 11 January 2018. \r\n\r\nThe Soul Nebula is a star forming region located 6,500 light years away in the constellation of Cassiopeia.  It is 100 light years across and contains several open clusters.\r\n\r\nSII: 42 x 1200s\r\nHa: 42 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 42 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 42 hours.\r\n\r\nData capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage processing: Steve Milne",
