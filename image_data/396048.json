    "description": "The object Dr15 (Drechsler 15) is most probably a very old, developed planetary nebula that has already interacted with the interstellar medium. This explains its non-circular shape.\r\nDr15 was discovered by me in December 2018 and is not far from the star Alpha Centauri. \r\nI found the object using the SuperCOSMOS H-alpha Survey (SHS).\r\n\r\nAround the PN you can see a spherical shock front filled with very thin OIII gas. Unusual, because there is hardly any OIII gas inside the PN.\r\nThe only explanation I have that it could be a PN is that dust in the foreground of the PN scatters the weak OIII signal too much and therefore nothing arrives at the sensor. \r\nThis is supported by the fact that there are no blue background stars in the region. All distant stars are yellow, orange to red, which indicates that their light is strongly scattered by dust. \r\n\r\nThere is also the possibility that this could be a supernova remnant. X-ray or radio data could be revealing.",
