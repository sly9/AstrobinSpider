    "description": "92x15sec subs taken with a RASA8  and the small pixel OSC grabbed this narrow field view of C/2020 F3 two nights before its closest approach to the earth.  \r\n\r\nProcessed solely in PixInsight this one came together surprisingly smooth.\r\n\r\nAt full resolution you can see the prismatic effect on the stars due to the comet's low altitude (10-15 degrees)  A planetary ADC would have been an interesting add-on if they made one with a wide field and a short enough spacing.\r\n\r\nBest!\r\nDan",
