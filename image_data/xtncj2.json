Although it is a fairly bright star with an apparent visual magnitude that varies from 1.6 to 3.0.\r\nGamma Cassiopeiae is a Be star, a variable star, and a binary star system. Based upon parallax measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite, it is located at a distance of roughly 550 light-years from Earth.  (star description credits: Wikipedia)",
