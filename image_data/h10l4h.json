    "description": "After many nights of really bad seeing and other obstacles, last night I managed to complete Cat's Paw in Hubble palette.\r\nIt's 24hs worth of data. I think this is close to the limit of what I can do with my setup, knowledge and observing conditions. I hope you guys enjoy it.\r\nClear skies everyone!\r\n\r\n*Dedicated to Bongo, my beloved cat that passed away a few weeks ago.\r\n\r\nps: last Tuesday I caught asteroid Liszt crossing between the fingers in the Paw, it amazes me that the 200p can resolve a rock only 13kms in diameter, orbiting beyond Mars!",
