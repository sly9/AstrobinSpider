    "description": "Now the whole nebula. After exposing new colour data in addition ( especially blue) I processed now the whole nebula. Had a quite good night for that. All in all ,I must say that the orion nebula is tough to process because of the dynamic range and a natural colour setting, especially for me, because I am a narrowband fan and as such one ,my skills in natural colour are few. I hope I have not overdone the processing.....",
