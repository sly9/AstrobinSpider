    "description": "Finally cleared and I got the RASA 8 up and running again on my old NEQ6, here aimed at some dark nebulosity near the Iris nebula. Had the ASI2600 set at gain 100 and -10Â°C.\r\n\r\nI think there is same drama in the image as dark forces appear to head toward the loverly Iris.",
