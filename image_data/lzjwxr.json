    "description": "Finally , one of my favorite galaxies, M81 is a real challenge, so famous  and not easy to process . Its core is very bright, and delicate dust lanes seem to evaporate around the nucleus. Some nice  HII nodules can be also be enhanced with an Ha layer.\r\nI threw away half of my lum data , and waited for perfect nights to get nice FWHM Luminance subs.\r\n\r\nMessier 81 (also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's Galaxy) is a grand design spiral galaxy about 12 million light-years away, with a diameter of 90,000 light years, about half the size of the Milky Way\r\n\r\n4 nights : 14,15, 17/18, 28, 30/31 march\r\n\r\n128 Light subs @180s gain zero and -20°C and\r\n\r\n72 Halpha subs @300s gain 139 and -20°C and\r\n20 Blue subs @180s gain zero and -20°C\r\n20 Green subs @180s gain zero and -20°C\r\n20 Red subs @180s gain zero and -20°C",
