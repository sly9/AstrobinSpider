    "description": "Located about 1,000 light-years from Earth, the nebula looks more than a little like the Golden State when viewed by visible-light telescopes: It is long and narrow, bending to the right near the bottom. The visible light comes from gas in the nebula being heated by a nearby, extremely massive star known as Xi Persei, or Menkib.\r\n\r\nThis image was shot over several nights from my backyard in San Diego, Ca.\r\n\r\n82 x 600\" (Ha)\r\n55 x 600\" (SII)\r\n55 x 600\" (OIII)",
