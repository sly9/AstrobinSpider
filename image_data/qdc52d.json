    "description": "M63 from year 2019.  Like the way it turned out. Biggest problem was stars. My new sx694 had issues with antiblooming, and brightest stars got weird shape. Tried everything I know, but without success, but at least, managed to reduce them. Some other projects going to have the same issue, but luckily Terry from SX showed me how to adjust  the antiblooming gate, hopefully, my camera will perform flawlessly from now on :).\r\nThis time tried Barry Wilson's approach combining Luminace and RGB, liked it a lot, it helped me to preserve colors. Thank you very much Barry for a nice tutorial :)\r\n\r\n170 frames in total.  Lum 80 frames, and 30 frames per channel RGB",
