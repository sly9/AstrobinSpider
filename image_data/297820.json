    "description": "By the time spring weather finally broke in central Oregon, M106 was at the meridian at sunset and darkness was lasting less than 5 hours so it was pretty late in the year to go for it.  My skies to the west aren't very good so it took nearly a solid week of shooting every night before I accumulated barely enough good data to process this image. It was a landmark image for me since I operated the scope fully remotely (just outside my back door) to test it before moving it to New Mexico this summer. All focusing was done using FocusLock and guiding was with a new ASI-1600MM. I didn't have time to try to add Ha data so that will be a good project in the future.  Along the way, I discovered that my calibration files were totally out of data so I had to spend an evening re-shooting flats, darks and bias to get this data properly calibrated.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot going on in M106 and this image makes me want even more resolution!  At the center of the galaxy is a supermassive and very active black hole that influences nearly everything about this galaxy.  Unlike most galaxies, M106 has 4 spiral arms.  The red wisps near the core are thought to be material blown out of the plane of the disk by energy generated by the black hole.\r\n\r\nC&C is always welcome so feel free to let me know what you think...\r\nJohn",
