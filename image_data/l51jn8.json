    "description": "Had a lot of issues during acquisition for this target and as I've found it, it is also quite a hard one to process in RGB. I ended up abandoning the NBRGBC script in PI, I just can't get it to look nice compared to just doing LRGB combination using Ha as Lum. This is a more basic way to add Ha data to RGB but it works, only downside is my stars are pretty MEH. One of my favourites spots in the sky but it really does deserve full NB treatment. Maybe next year.",
