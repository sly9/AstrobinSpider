    "description": "In this feed I show you the last images of the recent phases of Venus including the rare ring arc captured very close to the Sun just before the inferior conjunction. On June 2 only 0.05 percent of it was still illuminated. You see these irregularities in the brightness of the ring? It could caused by differences in the thickness of the aerosol layer of the Venusian atmosphere.\n\nFor the Venus Ring I used my Traveler from Astro-Physics in combination with a Baader FFC (and Herschel Prism). A RG-610 filter helped to improve the contrast. My old QHY5LII-M camera was a good choice to capture sequences of 10,000 frames. With AutoStakkert I stacked ~30% of two selected video files. Location: Spicheren, France\n\nImage: Dr. Sebastian Voltmer\n\nThe report: <a href=\"https://www.apollo-13.eu/tages-astrofotografie-der-venus\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.apollo-13.eu/tages-astrofotografie-der-venus</a>\n\nLearn more about the capturing techniques and my other photographic works in the Instagram profiles @sebastianvoltmer and @artcontrasts\n",
