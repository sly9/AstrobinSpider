    "description": "I really pushed it with this one. I really wanted this object this season so had to battle strong light pollution to my west as it sets early. I had to push the noise a bit high to get the signal of the dark clouds up but I'm pretty happy with it considering. Image is resampled 50% for AB file size constraints.\r\n\r\nvdB 38 is the blue reflection & Sh2-263 is the red emission of The Moldy Strawberry. Sh2-265 is the reddish faint emission nebula to the left with LDN 1589 and LDN 1590 as dark nebulae embedded in it.",
