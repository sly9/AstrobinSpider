    "description": "This small but mighty galaxy in the constellation of Octans is a collection of doubles. First, we have a double set of spiral arms that have wrapped themselves around the galaxyâ€™s central region. The central region itself is a double bar. And at both ends is a set of ansae (the bright spots plainly visible this image).\r\n\r\nAnsae are found in the extremities of planetary ring systems and in nebulous clouds. In galaxies like NGC 7098, the ansae are areas jammed with stars. \r\n\r\nThis is an RGB image. For an object only 4 arcminutes wide, a lot is going on! \r\n\r\nTech Notes:\r\nASA Newtonian, 500 mm aperture, 1900mm focal length, F3.6\r\nFLI Proline 16803, 9 mm pixel, 4096 X 4096\r\nASA DDM85 equatorial mount\r\nProcessing with PixInsight and Affinity Photo",
