    "description": "55,000,000 light years distant, NGC 1055 is seen edge on.  There is some evidence of warping in the disk, as well as a rather boxy halo, suggesting a prior encounter with a neighboring galaxy.  NGC 1055 is about 15% larger than the Milky Way and is considered a starburst galaxy.\r\n\r\nImage acquisition info:\r\n\r\nDate: November 2019 and 2020\r\nLocation:  Starlodge Observatory, Fairview UT\r\nTelescope:  AT 16 Ritchey Chretien\r\nCamera: Atik 16200\r\nLRGB: 63:29:32:28.
