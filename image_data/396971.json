    "description": "The lens is at 17mm/F4.0.  The sky and foreground were stacked separately, and blended together.\r\n\r\nThe telescope to the right is the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the largest single-dish submillimeter telescope in the world. The telescope is protected by a Gore-Tex membrane, which is transparent to submillimeter wave.\r\n\r\nThe moon phase isn't ideal for this shot. It will be much better a month later.",
