    "description": "IC348 is a reasonably young open cluster surrounded by the nebula VdB 19 and sits next to the bright blue star, Atik (Omicron Persei) which shines at magnitude +3.8. \r\n\r\nThe whole region is surrounded by dust and gas with HA emission coming from LBN 749, dark lanes including Barnard 3 and 4 & LDN1468/70; the whole region of dust emission extends west towards another commonly imaged object, NGC1333.\r\n\r\nI like the shape of the \"boxing hare\" silhouetted against the brighter dus/gas (just above/east of Barnard 3) - another animal in the dusty menagerie. \r\n\r\nThis is an LRGB image taken from EEYE, Extremadura during Jan, Feb & March 2021.\r\n\r\nImage capture: Paul Tribe, Graeme Coates\r\nProcessing: Graeme Coates",
