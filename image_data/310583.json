    "description": "The sky was clear tonight but with the light pollution and an almost 3/4 Moon it could not be\r\nconsidered dark by anyone's definition.   I was having trouble seeing some of the \r\nconstellations.   I didn't plan to image Cr 399 tonight.   It is an object that I've wanted to image\r\nbut just never got around to it.   I used to enjoy viewing it with binoculars.   I took a test image\r\nof what I intended on imaging tonight and decided that  it would not be a good idea because of\r\nthe Moon.  Several people lately have posted images of Cr 399 to Astrobin  so I decided that Cr 399\r\nmay be a good object to image with a Moon up.   I couldn't find Cr 399 with my scope at first\r\nbecause I could not see Sagitta the constellation that I usually use to locate it.  I went inside and\r\ngot my 15 X 70 Binoculars and scanned the sky where I thought it should be.  After a few minutes\r\nof searching I located it and made a note in my mind where I needed to point my scope.   I \r\nfound it quickly but I was kind of surprised how large it was in my AT72ED Refractor.   I\r\nconsider it a wide field scope but Cr 399 was taking up a lot of the field of view.    I was hoping\r\nthat Cr 399 would be smaller in my image but unfortunately it is what it is.   I  was really not\r\npleased with the framing of this object  but I had to kind of take what I could get.   I also hoped\r\nto capture a lot more of the dense star field than I did but again it is what it is.    There is\r\nonly so much that can be done when the Moon is directly over head and washing out the sky.\r\nWith all of that said I am pleased with my first image of this object  but  I'm sure I can do \r\nbetter on a Moonless night  so I'll probably revisit this object.  Please enjoy my first image\r\nof Cr 399 the Coat Hanger.",
