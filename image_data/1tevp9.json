    "description": "The famous Omega Centauri a very bright, expansive and stunningly beautiful globular cluster located in Centaurus. This image was an experiment to see if I could capture reasonable data on a bright object during a busy moon period. I grabbed one hour of data on the night of 3-4 May and the remaining three hours of data on the night of 4-5 May. The moon was between 77% to 88% illuminated over the two nights. Because of the bright moon I limited to sub times to 30 second but took lots of them (120 x 30s per channel for LRGB).\r\n\r\nI am pleased with the result and it is interesting to compare it to my previous Omega Centauri taken seven years ago. The equipment used then was a Skywatcher 4\" refractor and a Canon 550D DSLR (un modified). Here is a link to the previous image:\r\n\r\nhttps://astrob.in/41896/C/",
