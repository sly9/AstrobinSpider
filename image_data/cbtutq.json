    "description": "Great Orion Nebula in LRGB\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/.../50815743123/in/dateposted-public/\r\nBelieved to be the cosmic fire of creation by the Maya of Mesoamerica, M42 blazes brightly in the constellation Orion. Popularly called the Orion Nebula, this stellar nursery has been known to many different cultures throughout human history. The nebula is only 1,500 light-years away, making it the closest large star-forming region to Earth and giving it a relatively bright apparent magnitude of 4. Because of its brightness and prominent location just below Orion’s belt, M42 can be spotted with the naked eye, while offering an excellent peek at stellar birth for those with telescopes. It is best observed during January.\r\nImage shot with 16\" f3.7 Dreamscope astrograph FLI proline 16803 180mins ( 3hrs worth data)\r\n300 sec subs 1x1\r\nFor core older data used probably 2 years old \r\nCopyright : Utkarsh Mishra ( @mr_deepsky) Michael Petrasko, Muir Evenden\r\nwww.insightobservatory.com",
