    "description": "Imaged on nights of 2021/4/5, 2021/4/6, 2021/4/8\r\n\r\nAbell 29 (PK244.5+12.5) is a rarely imaged planetary nebula in Pyxis.  Abell29 is a fairly large Abell, measuring 6.7 arc minutes and has a magnitude listed at 14.3. It shows very faintly on the RGB image. The Ha signal is stronger than the Oiii signal, but the Ha is concentrated on the outer rim, so both show well.   It exhibits some lovely and striking detail, with the Ha very strong on opposite sides exhibiting bipolar properties.\r\n\r\nMy Collections:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae (70 of 79)</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2627/\" target=\"_new\">Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2626/\" target=\"_new\">Galaxies</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2625/\" target=\"_new\">Sharpless 2 Objects</a>",
