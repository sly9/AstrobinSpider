    "description": "One of the most cataclysmic events in the universe is the explosion of a massive star as a supernova, which can create a neutron star (NS). NSs are thought to be born rapidly spinning with rotation periods of a few 10 ms. Their rotation is first slowed down by magnetic dipole braking and then by the propeller effect when the NS is in a binary star system and mass loss from the companion star begins. When rotating slowly enough, accretion onto the NS sets in and the system can be detected as an X-ray binary. The spin evolution of the NS in a high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) system depends on the initial magnetic field strength of the NS and on the mass accretion rate. The remnant is oxygen-rich (in Blue) , indicating that it developed from a type Ib event. You will find it in the photo, just to the right of NGC602.\r\n\r\nThis image was produced with the Ha - Oiii - Sii filters and the composition was inspired by the method proposed by the author of <a href=\"https://thecoldestnights.com/2020/06/pixinsight-dynamic-narrowband-combinations-with-pixelmath/\">The Coldest Nights</a> \r\n\r\nThank you ForaxX!",
