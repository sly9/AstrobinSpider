    "description": "This is Sharpless 132: a rather complex nebula approximately 10200 light years distant. The gasses glow and are shaped by ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from several very hot stars in the vicinity. The nebula may have been a star nursery at one time but shows no signs of new star formation now.  I haven't posted any \"star pictures\" for a while because the last one (Sh2-112) frankly burned me out a bit: it was a very tough image to work on. This one came together much more easily. The palette is plain old SHO: the only color manipulation was an application of SCNR to reduce the green haze in the original combination.",
