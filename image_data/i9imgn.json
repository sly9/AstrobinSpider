    "description": "I was fascinated by  the double ring structure of this galaxy and decided that, regardless of its small apparent size (only 4 x 4,24 arc mins according to Stellarium), I had to give it a go! At Mag 10.37 and an estimated distance of 80.9 million light years the photons captured in this image left NGC 1398, and started their journey to us, during the Cretaceous period when dinosaurs still ruled the earth. Unfortunately over the 2 nights of capturing the constant breeze was enough to keep my guiding RMS pegged between 1 and 1.2 but I am still satisfied with the result. :-)",
