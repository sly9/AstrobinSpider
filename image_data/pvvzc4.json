    "description": "I originally processed in the SHO palette. I decided to give the more natural HOO palette a try. \r\n\r\nThis small Sharpless object sits high in the northern fall sky north of SH2-171, which is a common object imaged and south of Abell 85; a supernova remnant. Often called the small rosette due to its resemblance to the original, this small Sharpless object is five times smaller in size and much less bright than the Rosette Nebula; therefore it is not a common imaged target.",
