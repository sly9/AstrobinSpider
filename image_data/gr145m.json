    "description": "During the processing of Abell 39, we discovered a strange signal on the 26 first Oiii subs with a quick movment.\r\nAfter some inspection, it's confirmed that the signal in the Oiii filter was the comet C/2020 R4 ATLAS with exactly the same coordinates for the day & time of acquisition.\r\nSo with just the comet in Oiii filter, we managed to put it into G and B (minus) layers to include it in the final image.\r\nVery lucky, since this conjunction was not planned for shooting Abell 39!\r\nWe made a animated gif in the version B.\r\nHope you will like it,\r\n\r\nCS, Renaud & Olivier",
