    "description": "<b>Stefan's Quintet</b> close up from <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/314277/B>the whole frame</a>\r\n\r\nIn fact 6 Galaxies, only 5 of which are gravitationaly bound together and form first ever disconvered galaxy compact group (Hickson Compact Group 92) at distance ~ 300 mly (NGC 7320, the bluesh one, is located at distance only 40 mly). Discovered by Eduard Stefan in 1877.\r\n\r\nIntergalactic filament between NGC7319 and NGC7318A/B can also be seen (wave of bluesh colour) , which is now believed to be a giant intergalactic shock-wave (similar to a sonic boom but traveling in intergalactic gas rather than air) caused by one galaxy (NGC 7318B) falling into the center of the group at several millions of kilometers per hour.\r\n\r\nFull frame:\r\n<a href=https://www.astrobin.com/314277/B><img src=\"http://astrob.in/314277/B/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"></a>",
