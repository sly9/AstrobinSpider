    "description": "The North America Nebula is a field diffused emission nebula in the Cygnus, which was named due to the similar appearance of the continent. The Cygnus Wall is the part of the North America Nebula around the Mexico bay, where the star formations are more active. More details can be revealed through the narrows-band filters, only passing the specific emission lines. Both images of DSW and my own images were captured by H-alpha, OIII, and SII filters, respectively.",
