    "description": "Didn't think I could get deeper than my prior attempt with 28 hours of 5 nm Ha captured by Adam Block in his 32\" - with the moon out...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/9o5ja2/B/\">Prior \"Deep\" attempt</a>\r\n\r\nHere's my 20 hours of 5 nm Ha captured over the last 4 days between 8:30 PM and 1:30 AM PST. I was pleased to discover I could get noticeably deeper with 24\" vs 32\" and 20 hours vs 28 hours - but no moon with a 21.3 SQM sky all 4 days.\r\n\r\nRed-colored Ha was very carefully screened over LRGB to preserve all the Ha detail. Adam's stacked and deconvolved Ha has 1.78\" FWHM vs my 1.92\" FWHM, so there's a minor loss of Ha detail. The deeply exposed M82 core in Ha was significantly dimmed using both PI HDR and PS Shadows/Highlights to help preserve the natural RGB after the Ha screening process.",
