    "description": "I took a look at my prior \"dust free\" version this morning with fresh eyes...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/us1b7f/\">The Needle Galaxy minus Cosmic Dust</a>\r\n\r\n... and felt this could be done better with the quality of the data I collected over 10 days.\r\n\r\nSo here's a new version. More time spent up front with PI deconvolution – lower Global light (.01) and dark (0.0) values – and a deeper star and space mask.\r\n\r\nThen MUCH less processing required after that. (-:\r\n\r\nSharpening was very subtle using PI MLT with .05 on layer 2 and .1 on layer 3. The data after more extensive deconvolution just looked too good to go any further.\r\n\r\nColor calibration started with PI PCC. I then tweaked it a bit to remove some of the red \"haze\" but not all.\r\n\r\nThis final result is what I feel may be a more \"natural\" version with both \"softer detail\" and \"softer color\".",
