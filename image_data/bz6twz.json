    "description": "NGC 1097 is located 50 million light-years away. It is spiral-shaped like our Milky Way, with long, spindly arms of stars. The \"eye\" at the center of the galaxy is actually a monstrous black hole surrounded by a ring of stars.\r\n\r\nThe black hole is huge, about 100 million times the mass of our sun, and is feeding off gas and dust along with the occasional unlucky star.\r\n\r\n The jets trace an X centered on the galaxy's nucleus. It seems they don't originate there but  they could be fossil star streams, trails left over from the capture and disruption of a much smaller galaxy in the large spiral's ancient past.",
