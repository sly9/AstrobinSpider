    "description": "I've been drawn to the Ghost for several years now and have started imaging it each season.  Weather had not allowed me to collect enough data so this has been the project that got away.  I've always thought of this as \"Tortured Souls.\"  To me it looks like figures are being sucked into an eternal quagmire while a demon hover above.  These souls appear to be in  various stages of torment with one completely engulfed trying to break free.  \r\n\r\nThis August I've had terrific skies for a change and over the last two \"newish\" moon periods I have managed to collect 27 hours of data.  I generally don't take luminance frames, but this target is so dusty and faint that I decided I needed to try some.  \r\n\r\nI'm not very good at processing faint dust, so hopefully I'll be able to learn with this data and refine these skills.  It's a real balance between details, color and noise!\r\n\r\nC&C welcome and any advice on bringing out the dust would be great!",
