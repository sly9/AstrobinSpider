    "description": "I was sitting a long time on this project, mainly working on the star integration. I might have overdone it a bit, but came up with a mechanism to reduce the star sizes to a (my) minimum. They seem a bit too sharp, but I did not want to start the process again (I guess if it rains more here then I will do that). My idea was to create masks on different levels of stretch, and eliminate this way all the bloated stars. At the end I added up all different masks to one and used it as color mask for the RGB stars with a highly stretched RGB image. I should have done the star mask generation a bit fuzzier, not sure if that would have been better, the future will tell. At least I have now an idea hoe to integrate the stars in a better way, if anybody else has a better one please let me know! I also obtained a set of HÃŸ data to see if this would make a difference, and it did not, hence I will stay with the recommended list of targets for this filter from now on. I used it as Luminance at least.",
