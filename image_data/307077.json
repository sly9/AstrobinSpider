    "description": "Took more data on the Western Veil Nebula last night! Combined with the last time I imaged it (Western Veil #1), this image represents 3h45m of total imaging time.\r\n\r\nPart of the Cygnus Loop, which is a supernova remnant from a star that exploded sometime between 6,000-3,000 BC, it is also sometimes called the Witch's Broom. It lies about 1,470 lightyears away.",
