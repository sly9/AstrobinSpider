    "description": "unfortunately a bit out of focus ...\r\nA cloudy sky was predicted for the night, but I wanted to use the time for a series. Since it was a shooting star night anyway, I was able to pass the time ...\r\nAt around 3:37 CEST the Starlink - 9 train was forecast.\r\nUnfortunately I could see half the train and guessed it to be 3-4 mag. \r\nI could not see the other half with naked eyes! We have a 5.5 mag sky because the moon is still slightly in the sky, you can`t still say for sure, but with this brightness it would be much better!\r\nUPDATE 21.08.2020 \r\nA composite with pictures from 08/21/2020 that show somewhat sharper stars.\r\nBahtinov mask used correctly :D -> check :)",
