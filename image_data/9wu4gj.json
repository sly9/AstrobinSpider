    "description": "M82 galaxy in Ursa Major has apparent dimension of 11.2’x4.3’ and an estimated distance of 12 million of light years. \r\nIt is the closest starburst galaxy: its activity is due to an interaction with the neighbouring galaxy M81 (the distance between the two galaxies is about 300000 light years). \r\nThis interaction has led in M82 to an increase of the star forming regions mainly in the central zone where there are 4 regions of high superficial luminosity. \r\nThe peculiarity of this galaxy is the presence of a superwind perpendicular to the galaxy plane: it is originated just from the central active region and it is powered by the explosions of supernova stars.\r\n\r\nwww.robertomarinoni.com",
