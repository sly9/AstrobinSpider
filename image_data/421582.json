    "description": "Like chinese writings in the sky ... with this dark nebula  LDN673 in Aquila\r\nThe shot is build with a mosaic of 2 frames in LRGB.  Well , I made a few mosaics before but this one was particularly tough to realize, some bright stars were just on the seam between the 2 shots ...\r\nOn the other hand , I did not want to bloat the big stars like the one at the top. The gold effect of the milky way is really amazing .\r\n\r\nRed 40 subs@180s -20째C gain zero\r\nBlue 40 subs@180s -20째C gain zero\r\nGreen 40 subs@180s -20째C gain zero\r\nLight  92 subs@180s -20째C, gain zero\r\n\r\n5 Nights : 23, 29/30,30/31, 01/02 02  of July , and August",
