    "description": "Rarely do I  have success at Ha-OIII bicolor images.  This data was collected some time ago and all images were lost in the infamous crash.  I found the original data and reprocessed the image.  I have always liked a red based palette for this nebula, though I have not yet attempted an LRGB image.  Until I do, this bicolor Ha-OIII palette seems more fitting than the Hubble Palette that I usually employ in my narrow band work",
