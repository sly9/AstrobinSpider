    "description": "Processed with synthetic L derived from RGB.\r\nI did take 130 subs on the Np127is in L, but I get a better result just using the synthetic L from the RGB.\r\nImaged on nights of 8/24/2019 and 8/25/2019.\r\n\r\nNGC 246, known as the Skull Nebula, is a planetary nebula in the constellation Cetus. The nebula and the stars associated with it are listed in several catalogs, as summarized by the SIMBAD database. It is roughly 1,600 light-years away. The nebula's central star is the 12th magnitude white dwarf HIP 3678.\r\n\r\nAmong some amateur astronomers, NGC 246 is known as the \"Pac-Man Nebula\" because of the arrangement of its central stars and the surrounding star field.\r\n(Wikipedia)",
