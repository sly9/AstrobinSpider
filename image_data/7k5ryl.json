    "description": "This image is a combination of data acquired in the past with two different setups:\r\n\r\nSept.2019, Esprit150 and ASI071, 150x120secs , at pixel scale 0.915 arcsec/pixel,\r\nand\r\nSept2020, Takahashi FSQ106ED4 and ASI2600, 150x300secs at pixel scale 1.456 arcsec/pixel\r\n\r\nAll individual calibrated subs were normalised, aligned and scaled on the smaller FOV and then processed (all in Pixinsight).\r\nIt was an interesting project, which indicates again that it is a good practice to keep older data available :-)",
