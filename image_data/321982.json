    "description": "This is a major part of the constellation Cygnus, including Deneb and Sadr as main stars, covering a field of about 20 by 20 degrees. This image focusses on the rich H-alpha nebulosity in this region. In contains some of the famous emission nebulae, e.g. the North America Nebula, the Pelican Nebula, the Crescent Nebula, and the Veil Complex. However, what I find even more exciting is the sheer mass of nebulosity that covers the whole field with dramatic ripples and dark lanes. Make sure to zoom in as far as you can to really see the amazing detail in this image.\r\n\r\nThis is a 5 x 7 mosaic (35 panels) obtained with the Samyang 135mm lens and the ATIK 460ex camera using the 3.5nm Baader H-alpha filter. Nine panels were from an earlier imaging run, the rest was taken from the light-polluted skies of my backyard. \r\n\r\nProcessing was rather easy, thanks to the MosaicByCoordinates and GradientMergeMosaic tools of PixInsight. The file at full resolution – more than 100 mega-pixels – is getting a bit large, so this a 50% resampled version. In addition there is an annotated version B, including all the Sharpless, NGC, and IC objects in this region.",
