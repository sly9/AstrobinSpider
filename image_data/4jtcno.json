    "description": "I've never taken a good photo of the Great Orion Nebula M42 but in 1 hour and 40 minutes, under a 97% Moon, I've come closer than ever.\r\n\r\nThat's the window I had between roof and trees to capture this very bright but for me, notoriously difficult nebula, now returning to our night skies for another summer.\r\n\r\nWhile I gathered a set of longer and shorter subs with the DSLR through the 200/1000 Newtonian (El Bucko) I also collected sets of longer and shorter Hydrogen Alpha subs through the f/7.6 doublet refractor (Old Gold). \r\n\r\nI blended the Ha into the red channel and luminance, for both the neb and core exposures, then layered the core on the neb. \r\n\r\nKept the Newt stars because... colour and spikes.\r\n\r\nOrion Season is open.",
