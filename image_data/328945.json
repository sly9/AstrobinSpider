    "description": "I recently uploaded a version shot with a f/3.8 Riccardi-Honders composed of 23.50 hours of lights.  This adds 33.50 hours of data from a f/6.3 Tak FSQ.  The critical subs were the OIII subs and both scopes took 1800s subs: 29 from the RH and 55 from the FSQ.  Given the speed differences a FSQ sub collected a bit more than a third of the light of a RH sub of equal duration.  So, the resulting exposure only increased by 69% despite increasing from 14.50 hours of OIII to 42.00 hours.  These data sets were mutually rotated so I had to crop down to the point where much of the Flying Bat was cut while preserving the Squid.  All in all I like my processing of the RH only version better,",
