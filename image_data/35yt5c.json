    "description": "Hi everybody.\r\nI'm trying some new (for me) techniques in imaging.\r\nThis is a try under a very light polluted sky (my hometown), 18.60 mag/arcsec SQM.\r\nI have done a live stack of 2880 frames, 10 seconds each, grouping 60 at a time (10 minutes each group), using a Newton 250 f/4 and a ZWO Asi294mc and no guide at all. \r\nNeither flats nor darks. \r\n8 hours of total exposing time over three nights (10-11-12/May/2020).\r\nProcessing such a picture was very challenging: without calibration frames I've fought against every kind of gradient you'd imagine. \r\nBesides that, I think this is an interesting picture, considering the sky and the minimal gear and subexposure time used.\r\nHope you enjoy it.\r\nCiao",
