    "description": "The Veil supernova remnant is magnificently beautiful and I wanted to capture the entirety of it. This has been my most ambitious project yet, consisting of 9 panels, and over 100 hours of acquisition.  \r\n\r\nIt was actually my first mosaic process, and I have to give special thanks to Dennis Sprinkle for providing me with his APP mosaic workflow.\r\n\r\nI also followed David Ault's mosaic tutorial - Highly recommend it!\r\n\r\nMy process workflow went as follows: Organize all the subframes into appropriate directories for channel and panel. PixInsight: Batch preprocess the subs for calibration; Eliminated any bad frames; StarAlignment; Integration; Cropping; ABE; export each master panel as TIFF. Astro Pixel Process: Import all the master panels; mosaic registration and integration. Did that whole process for each channel. Load mosaic images into PixInsight: Cropping; DBE; Deconvolution; Combination; Background and color calibrations; HistogramTransformation; Luminance and Saturation tweaks; light HDR applied. Then exported as TIFF and imported into LightRoom. LightRoom: adjusted color temperature; applied noise reduction; applied sharpening; adjusted background shadows.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any question, comments, or feedback! I'd love to share more about any part of my workflow and process with anyone curious.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
