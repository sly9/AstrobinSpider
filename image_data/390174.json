    "description": "I processed this data in Dec 2017 and returned to it in March and April 2018.  First time posting to astrobin. Originally posted on FB.  There is an oval, uncorrected lens flare in the middle right side caused by the bright Aldeberan.  First time I saw one of those in my image data I thought it was some kind of undiscovered nebula. :-)\r\n\r\nL = 36x 300s (12/10 - 12/12/2017)\r\nR = 47x 300s (12/8 - 12/16/2017)\r\nG = 29x 300s (12/8 - 12/17/2017)\r\nB = 39x 300s (12/8 - 12/17/2017)\r\n\r\nAfter cleaning up a few noisy pixels and retuning the colors, eliminating green in the pursuit of perfection, I felt  that some of the yellow vibrance of the original was lost while seeking mainly to eliminate a few rays of green coming out of Aldeberan, if you look closely. So, I set back the first to final as imperfect but good enough, especially if you don't zoom down to the pixels on the full size :-)",
