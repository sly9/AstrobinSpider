    "description": "Here we have IC342 The Hidden Galaxy.  This is an intermediate spiral galaxy located somewhere between 7 and 11 million light years away in Camelopardalis.  \r\n\r\nThe line of site to this one is actually close to the galactic equator of the Milky Way and  thus is obscured by gas and dust.  \r\n\r\nThis is one of the closest galaxies to us yet not in the Local Group.\r\n\r\nThis project was delayed by the smoke from the California fires so to finally get some more clear skies to finish this was nice.  I enjoyed this project very much and was particularly happy with my luminance data.  \r\n\r\nSo the final product shown here is unfortunately, unfinished.  I usually use the staging area here to post my images to see how they look on various different devices and then make some final adjustments to the images before sending them to the public space.  I also like to let them sit for a day or two before publishing to combat what I call image fatigue.  You know, when you are working on an image so long you lose perspective and the ability to actually \"see\" it.  \r\n\r\nI keep my data and projects on external hard drives.  This as I learned, can be a mistake.  I somehow dropped my current 1tb external disk from about 1/2 meter and now, it won't log up and just clicks.  I gave it to one of my IT boys at the office and they told me that it was toast.  Nearly a years worth of projects and all my calibration files.\r\n\r\nWell, live and learn I guess...  It'll be SSDs and cloud storage going forward.\r\n\r\nIn this image, I did manage to get a lot of good quality Ha data too.  I was trying to find the right level of this and in this final image. I think I could have brought the Ha up a little bit.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is what I have to share and I hope you like it!\r\n\r\nClear Skies and of course, all comments/criticism are welcome!",
