    "description": "Milky Way center from Namibia Isabis 2018\r\n\r\nDuring my Namibian expedition I didn't plan to make image with photo lense, but the look of the Milky Way center in the zenith is simply breathtaking. I couldn't let myself to come home without imaging it. Fortunately one of my mate Patrik lended me a Canon EOS 6D and a 24-70 lens so I was able to do othis image. Tourist photo from Isabis.\r\n\r\n124* 10 sec, ISO6400, Canon EOS 6D modified, Canon 24-70 F2,8@24mm Credit goes to Patrik Tarczy for the equipment",
