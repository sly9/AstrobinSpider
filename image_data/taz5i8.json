    "description": "This image combines DSLR RGB data collect in 2017 with CCD narrowband data collected in 2020. The 2017 data were collected with a Canon 70d full-spectrum mod and an Orion 6” RC. The 2020 data were collected with a ZWO ASI1600 MM Pro and a WO FLT132 refractor. My original plan was to use Ha narrowband data to create a luminance mask to reduce the noise and enhance the structural detail of the DSLR image. In this approach, while the emission nebula portions of the resulting image were improved, the reflection nebulae were obscured and the structural detail was lost. So instead I created a composite image, combining emission nebulae portions of the field in a SHO image with the reflection nebulae in the field from the DSLR RGB image. To accomplish this, I stacked the two images in Photoshop Layers and created a mask that allowed the reflection nebulae of the DSLR RGB image to appear in the SHO narrowband image. The resulting image has the tight resolution and structural detail of the emission nebulae, as well as the delicate details and natural color palette of the DSLR-captured reflection nebulae. I like how this image turned out and will use this RGB/NB composite processing technique in the future.\r\n\r\nTip of the hat to Alan Pham for adding the Alnitak star spikes.",
