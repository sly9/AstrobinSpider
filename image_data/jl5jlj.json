    "description": "To better use the large image circle of TEC 140, I upgraded my imaging camera to  Moravian G2 16200.  Comparing to my previous work horse ASI1600, it is much better. The sub is just smoother and deeper with better details. In this season and limited to backyard, I don't have many options and decided to shoot Rosette Nebula again.  Weather wasn't very incorporated and the window from my backyard has dwindled from 4 hours to 2.5 hours per clear night. It took almost a month to get  barely enough data. I tried couple of different  color combinations back and forth. After tweaking it on and off for a week, I settled to this version.  Hope it is enjoyable from this traditional object.\r\n\r\nInformation of Subs:\r\nHa: 11x20min\r\nS2:  16x 20min\r\nO3: 15x20min\r\nRGB for stars:  17x120s",
