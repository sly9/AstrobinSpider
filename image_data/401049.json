    "description": "As a test process to make sure the mosaic fits together, I have processed the luminance that Steve and I have collected to date: varying from 1.5hrs to 2hrs in each of the six panels.  The weather is not co-operating much at the moment and a patient approach is required for this ambitious project through the galaxy season.\r\n\r\nAt this stage there is a fair amount of noise across the mosaic however the abundance of galaxies is clear and I have been amazed staring at my screen.  Annotated image is included too for amusement: it is a busy image ;-).\r\n\r\nWill update as data accrues!\r\n\r\nUpdate: we have added 2 further panels, total now 8.  This mosaic of the luminance does have quite a variation of subs in each panel so it is relatively noisy and with background gradient variations.  It will of course improve as we gather further data.  We have some RGB but lots more to do!\r\n\r\nThere is a splendid array of galaxy shapes and types so worth a view at high resolution . . . just forget the background variations.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
