    "description": "Following is an image of Mars taken on September 19 with variable stability and transparency. This is one of the most iconic faces of Mars, showing the famous albedo patch of Solis Planum, known to past astronomers as \"the eye of Mars\" due to its curious round shape. To the north of the structure is the famous Vallis Marineris, one of the largest valleys in the Solar System. North up and South up views!",
