    "description": "This is a 6 panel mosaic of the Horse head and M42.\r\n\r\nProcessing was done in PI and PS. \r\n\r\nMatching the frames proved more difficult than normal due to a huge variation in signal to noise between frames, but I'm happy with the final product.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately getting colour data for this target is almost impossible from my location, but would love to add it eventually.\r\n\r\nAs always C&Cs are most welcome. Thanks for looking.",
