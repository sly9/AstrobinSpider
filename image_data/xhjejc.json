    "description": "IC 5146 is an open star cluster associated with a diffuse nebula, type H-II.\r\nLocated in the northern part of the Cygnus constellation, the small cluster is surrounded by a very small, cocoon-shaped nebula, connected in turn by a system of dark nebulae known as B 168. This nebular group, together with the cluster, are distant from Earth about 1012 pc (3300 light years).",
