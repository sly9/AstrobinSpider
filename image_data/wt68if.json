    "description": "If you look high in the west at sunset, the radiant Venus is now quickly setting behind the Sun.\r\n\r\nA year on Venus is only 225 days and is speeding past us in solar orbit, positioning itself between us and the Sun. In this season, Venus looms large and we progressively see more of a crescent phase, as the sunlit side is hidden from view. Venus will quickly slide lower in the evening dusk, only to reappear in the late-June dawn sky as it speeds past us.\r\n\r\nYou all know I’ve mentioned it’s going to be a great year for planetary observation. During July, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto (the planet) will all be observable in the morning! This doesn’t happen often.\r\n\r\nThis image was shot through an achromatic telescope, so the luminance came from the green light filter.   The color is composed of an extended spectrum of UV-G-NIR for R-G-B.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
