    "description": "NGC 1514 preprocessed with 2x CFA Drizzle - due to light pollution and lots of noise which would have required me to apply an artificially looking strong NR or to downscale the image, I focused on the nebula's detail rather than on showing the interstellar dust. But I was pretty impressed, how much of it there was, so I also uploaded an over-stretched monochrome version to make the amount visible. It took me quite a while to realize that there really are almost no bluish stars in that area and that the dust is particulary illiuminated orange from the stars present. First I thought that I made mistakes while processing the colors - but after checking fellow AB members' images I finally accepted the (orange) facts.",
