    "description": "The Supernova Remnant IC443 otherwise known as the Jellyfish Nebula and Sharpless 248, lying at a distance of approximately 5000 light years from us in the constellation Gemini, visible towards the top left in this image is the Jellyfish, the remains of a supernova that occurred between 3000-30000 years ago, lower right in this image is the diffuse and reflection Nebula IC444 otherwise known as Sharpless 249. \r\n\r\nCaptured using data from Grand Mesa Observatory's system 1 the Takahashi FSQ 130 (available on our subscriptions) using the new QHY367 Pro C full frame One Shot Color CMOS camera with Chroma Narrowband Filters.\r\n \r\nIn this Hubble Palette version the H-Alpha is mapped to green, SII is mapped to red and OIII is mapped to the blue channel. Then I used the naturally colored stars from the broadband image, while the colors in this image are not the true colors, the narrowband filters used in the making of this Hubble Palette image reveal much more of the hidden gasses not visible in a broadband image. \r\nCaptured over 5 nights in January and February 2020 for a total acquisition time of 16.5 hours.\r\nTechnical Details\r\nCaptured and processed by: Terry Hancock\r\nLocation: GrandMesaObservatory.com Purdy Mesa, Colorado \r\nDates of Capture January 15, 17, 19, February 2, 11 2020 \r\nHA 240 min 16 x 900 sec \r\nOIII 450 min 30 x 900 sec \r\nSII 300 min 20 x 900 sec \r\nNarrowband Filters by Chroma \"5nm\"\r\nCamera: QHY367 Pro C\r\nGain 2850, Offset 76 with Dark, Bias and Flat Frames\r\nOptics: Walter Holloway's Takahashi FSQ 130 APO Refractor @ F5\r\nEQ Mount: Paramount ME \r\nImage Acquisition software Maxim DL6 Pre Processing in Pixinsight Post Processed in Photoshop CC",
