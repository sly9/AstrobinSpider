    "description": "Little \"Neo\" having a bath in huge ocean waves on the early morning of July 8th, 2020 at 02:19 UTC. \r\nI was amazed to see it for the first time and if this wasn't enough, mother nature added a huge amount of NLCs. The NLCs reached a level comparable to the evening-NLC-event 2 days ago (which I missed photographing).\r\n\r\nThis guy is a naked-eye object. It's my hero of the year!\r\nUsing a pair of binoculars makes the experience even more spectacular.\r\nThe NLCs did not exactly help in visibility, but still, I could clearly identify the comet by naked eye. But honestly, when will such a coincidence ever happen again, NLCs and a comet at the same time?!\r\nPerhaps tomorrow? Lol :-D - you never know with NLCs..... ;-)\r\n\r\nIn the upcoming days it will climb higher in the northern sky making it observable in the evening hours also. Be sure not to miss it!\r\n\r\nNLCs dynamics:\r\nI made a videoclip (tried to) out of 51 still frames demonstrating the astonishing dynamics of the NLCs. Actually the NLC material itselfs is not forming the waves, it is rather floating over them. See it in the video \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GC4eJevWvg\r\n\r\nClear skies!!\r\nOkke :-)",
