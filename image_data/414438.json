As well as another brilliant astrophotographers he chose, like Emil, Johannes, Leo Orazi, Sara Wager, and countless humans beings spreaded all over the world - the way to good will, to be humble and help less fortunate hobbyists, just like me, a poor dreamer! :-)\r\n\r\nI think they chose his path because they are clever and enlightened beings... and because they learned that we are nothing, even less in a hospital bed, just star dust, given the gigantic dimension of the Cosmos...and the humility gave all this men and girls the gift to be great even in your tiny planet...\r\n\r\nWell... thanks a lot for all Astrobin guys and girls motivation...!!! Hope you enjoy this Antennae Galaxy processing !!\r\n\r\nDaniel...",
