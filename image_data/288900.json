    "description": "One of the brighter galaxies visible to us, NGC 253 belongs to the Sculptor group...the next door neighbor to our own Local Group of galaxies, which includes our own Milky Way.  With an apparent diameter of almost one half degree (the size of the full moon), it is readily visible in small telescopes.  NGC 253 lies at a distance of 12.8 million light years.  \r\n\r\n",
