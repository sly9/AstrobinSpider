    "description": "* Image acquisition (Halpha) by <a href=\" https://www.astrobin.com/users/JTravis1965/ \"> John Travis</a>.\r\n* Image acquisition (HaRGB) by The Liverpool Telescope. \r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n\r\nOn day 4, I got a big fright. Not because of the ghost but because I went to the doctor and had to undergo surgery on the same day. Luckily it went well and I was able to return to contact with the ghost.\r\n\r\nI quite like this object because it carries with it a certain mysticism. And in this mysterious context, i used data from the LTA, an RC equipped with a primary mirror of 2m diameter and exposures of 1,4h. I wanted to see the ghost in a close up. But it was not possible. Perhaps in other wavelengths that penetrate dusty areas it is possible to contemplate the ghost.\r\n\r\nThis ghost can be found about 600 light-years in the direction of the constellation Cassiopeia.\r\n\r\nIts appearance results from the influence of the ultraviolet ionizing radiation of the hot and luminous star Cass gamma.\r\n\r\nIC 63 is dominated by red light emitted by H-alpha as ionized hydrogen atoms recombine with electrons.\r\n<a href=\"http://astrob.in/323610/0/\"><img src=\"http://astrob.in/323610/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
