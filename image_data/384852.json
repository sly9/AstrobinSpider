    "description": "This is started out as one of the early images I was shooting with the Planewave and STX.  I tried to fit M81 and M82 in the same frame with both in the corner.  Bad idea....  \r\n\r\nAfter starting over twice with a focus just on M81, due to registration problems, I found the only part of the of the original data I could use was the core.  I almost always use a Super-luminance of all color and luminance subs and I did here as well.  So that core includes data from at least 35 hours of subs.  But the rest of the galaxy is a Super-luminance of the sharpest half of the Luminance, Red, Green, and Blue subs.   Ha was used to enhance the nebulae - I added it in photoshop as a colorized layer in lighten mode.\r\n\r\nOne goal I had when processing was to get detail out of the core while retaining the \"domed\" look that it has naturally.  By that I mean the core is thicker than the spiral arms and I wanted to make sure it looked that way.\r\n\r\nGiven the depth of the Super-Luminance data, I have a good base to add IFN data later.  But for now I just want to have a COMPLETED M81!",
