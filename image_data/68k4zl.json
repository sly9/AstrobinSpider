    "description": "There are so many rich and wonderful targets in Orion and so many ways to present them.  I have always liked this area of Orion, even naked eye viewing as it seems to me, there is some vague nebulosity visible. \r\n\r\nI have seen some very wide-field images of the area that encompass the entire round nebula that I think is a nice representation of the whole head of Orion.  Here we have an image that focuses more on the brilliant open cluster in the middle of that.    I may go back and try to capture the whole head of The Hunter with a Samy 135 as a complementary project a little later in the season.\r\n\r\nThis is a very young cluster (~5 million years old)  located about 1,300 ly away and contains some very nice blue giants.  The largest and brightest is Lambda Orionis, also known as Meissa, which emits about 65,000 times the energy of our sun and effectively lights up the surrounding molecular cloud.  (credit The Houston Astronomical Society)\r\n\r\nThis is a typical HaLRGB image as I find I really like the natural RGB color palette but i like it just a little more with the enhancement we can get by incorporating the Ha.\r\n\r\nI hope you like this one and as always, comments/criticism welcome!",
