SII, OIII and rgb stars were a single frame shot through my Esprit 80.\r\n\r\nHA - 22 subs @ 600 sec per panel\r\nOii - 156 subs @ 180 sec\r\nSii - 228 subs @ 180 sec\r\nRGB - 120 subs @ 60sec per filter\r\n\r\nMajority of processing was completed in PI, with final tweaks and saturation completed in PS.\r\n\r\nAs always any comments are greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nCheers, George",
