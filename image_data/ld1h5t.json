    "description": "One of my favorite deep sky objects, Melotte 15, with its grand nebulous spire at the core of the Heart Nebula in Cassiopeia is a relatively newborn star cluster and emission nebula at only about 1.5 million years young. The nebulous clouds are sculpted by the stellar winds and radiation from massive hot stars - a few nearly 50 times the mass of our sun. Melotte 15 is located about 7500 light years from Earth.
