These are hot, giant stars at the end of their stellar evolution - in a a 'pre-supernova' phase. The nebula is estimated to be around 30 light years in diameter.\r\n\r\nThis is a bicolour image from the Deep Sky West remote imaging facility in New Mexico. Data collection took place over several nights between 27 December 2017 and 5 February 2018.\r\n\r\nHa: 28 x 1800s\r\nOIII: 14 x 1800s\r\n\r\nA total of 21 hours exposure.",
