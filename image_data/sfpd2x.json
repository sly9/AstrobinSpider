    "description": "Cygnus Wall\nNGC7000 is a pretty cool target with a huge nebula characterized as the North American nebula.  Part of this structure is a wave or wall called Cygnus Wall.  Near the start of Deneb in the constellation Cygnus, this light is about 2200 light years away.\n\nThis was captured using a 8″ Edge HD with Hyperstar and then the stars removed to showcase the dust and nebula swirling around in this beauty.  I processed it in the Hubble color palette which really highlights the various areas and depth of it.\n\nHa Filter:  24×300″\nOiii Filter: 30×240″\nSii Filter:  41×240″",
