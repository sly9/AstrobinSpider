    "description": "This is an attempt to reprocess a data set I collected in 2017.  I do remember processing this galaxy was really tough with my first attempt.  I could see many features that I wanted to reveal in the RAW data, but my choices in processing helped in some areas, but in other places, diabolical would be a good choice for a word.  My previous attempt suffered from a splotchy background and I wanted to work on this a little.  The galaxy had more in it, and I wanted to lift that a little, hopefully adding an element of depth.  The optical jets were a little noisy as the signal is very weak.  My attempts to reveal these may have contributed to the background levels not being ideal.  \r\n\r\nTwo years later, and a little more practice, I decided to have another go.  This time, I have presented a wide field shot using the full-frame of my sensor.   This presentation certainly has less impact but retaining the full-frame allows the many galaxies distributed throughout to be seen.  So many of those smudges that are visible while zoomed in are galaxies.  There are hundreds of them within this field.  I love exploring and searching for galaxies in images.   The main subject is 45 million years away, just imagine how far away some of the galaxies that are only pixels across are.  \r\n\r\nNGC 1097 can be found in the constellation of Fornax, and is classified as a SBbc, barred spiral galaxy.  It’s a fantastic galaxy to look at and is very dramatic.  The distortions and tidal debris have been caused by the interaction with its companion galaxy NGC 1097A.  A galactic train wreck. Personally, the most interesting thing would have to be the optical jets that are visible in deep exposures.  Optical jets are very rare, and NGC 1097 has four.  Only three are clearly visible in this image.   The current theory is that the jets are actually the shattered remains of a cannibalized dwarf galaxy, and composed of stars, but without hydrogen gas.  The gas may have been stripped away in the past during this interaction.   \r\n\r\nLike all nice galaxies, it has a supermassive black hole at its centre. The mass has been calculated to be 140 million times the mass of our sun\r\n\r\nObject Details\r\nNGC 1097, Arp 77\r\nConstellation: Fornax, Galaxy type: SBbc (barred spiral)\r\nSize: 9.3’ x 6.2’\r\nRecession Velocity: 1,284 km/sec\r\n\r\nInstruments:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\n36 X 900 Bin 1X1 Lum\r\n12 X 450 Bin 2X2 Red\r\n12 X 450 Bin 2X2 Green\r\n12 X 450 Bin 2X2 Blue\r\n19 X 1200 Bin 1X1 Ha\r\nPixel scale: 0.8\r\n\r\nLocation\r\nAustralia, Central Victoria",
