    "description": "I used this target as something to fill imaging time after the Pleiades went behind my neighbor's house.  Because my camera was rotated for the Pleiades mosaic, I didn't get the framing I wanted at all. But I am very happy with the way the colors worked out. I may have to come back to this another time for a better framed image.",
