    "description": "Here's an image of the Lagoon Nebula in SHO that I had from DSW.  There's so much blue from the OIII, I found it kind of hard to process but I think it's toned down a bit, so I thought I'd post it anyway.  I've been taking data with my rig but since I got that ASIAir Pro...I had the camera settings wrong and wasted 5 nights of clear sky imaging.....oh well, I'll get it right and have some of my own images soon!\nAnyway, hope ya like this one!\nTom",
