    "description": "Finally, the first narrowband image this summer! One of my favourites objects of Cygnus that was on my bucket list,  the Tulip nebula is situated at 8000 ly away close to Eta Cygni. It is modeled by the bright O star HDE 227018 situated in the center of the nebula.\r\n\r\nIt was a long project, with really bad guiding during the first hours of the night, during May when the elevation is lower. The project is a classic SHO composition with RGB stars.",
