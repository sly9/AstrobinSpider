    "description": "NGC-7380 in SHO.\r\n\r\nProcessing on this started off normally -- calibration and tone-mapping the narrowband channels -- and then went off the rails. Normally, I'd create a synthetic luminance by combining the original Ha with the O-iii and S-ii tone maps. Unfortunately some of my Ha data was slightly out of focus with the result that I had to choose between bloated stars or severely clipped luminance.\r\n\r\nHmm. What to do. I ended up working over the combined tone map image more than usual: two rounds of LocalHistogramEqualization with a range mask to heighten contrast in the nebula, curves to increase overall contrast and restore a bit of saturation, MultiscaleMedianTransform with a small amount of bias at layers 1-5 to sharpen details, and a final round of curves for contrast. Then I added the RGB stars using PixelMath, and used a gentle round of SCNR on the background (nebula protected by a range mask) to desaturate the red channel a bit.\r\n\r\nThe result is probably a little less crisp than it would be with a proper luminance but I like that it captured faint nebulosity in the region and the stars were prettier than the hard white stars that tone-mapping + luminance usually produces.",
