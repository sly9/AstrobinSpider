    "description": "Messier 77. This galaxy, discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1780, is one of the largest galaxies in the Messier catalog. But its extreme distance, at 45 million light years, makes it a very difficult target for two amateurs with an 11” telescope. It is a Seyfert galaxy—that is, a galaxy with a very active galactic core. That activity involves a huge supermassive black hole eating gas, dust, stars, and anything else that gets too close, while spewing out jets of hyper-energetic particles.",
