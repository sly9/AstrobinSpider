    "description": "The Angel is a very small Nebula nestled in a field of dim Ha emission.  It measures about 3 arc minutes, or maybe 6 Jupiter's wide.   A young massive star at the center of the hourglass structure is emitting jets of hot gas and ionizing nearby dust.  At only 100,000 years old, this star has been busy!  I believe the Blue star is obscured by left jet.  This one shows up in Blue and OIII while the right did not.\r\n\r\nHubble version here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh2-106#/media/File:Sharpless_2-106.jpg\r\n\r\nIt is pictured upside-down here, if that is possible with objects in the sky.  The wonderful Hubble version clearly shows the \"gown\" of the angel - a small \"V\" shape between the wings made by the jets.  My image only subtly hints at the gown of the Angel so I chose to orient the image with the bulk of the surrounding HII emission at the bottom for aesthetic purposes.\r\n\r\nI started the image as a SHO capture but, not seeing the Angel's gown, I finished with LRGB.   The final product here is a blend with SHO+Luminance for Luminance, Ha+SII+Red for Red, Green for Green, and OIII+Blue for Blue.\r\n\r\nA total of 31.7 hours, 2/3s being SHO and 1/3 being LRGB.\r\n\r\nTo give a better idea how small this is I upoaded a full frame, 0.5 degree FOV version as version C.",
