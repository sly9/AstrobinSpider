    "description": "Melotte 15 in Cassiopeia  \r\n\r\nAt left, is an open cluster of bright stars located at the heart of the Heart Nebula- IC 1805. Named for its discoverer, Philibert Jacques Melotte (1880-1961), the grouping of O-type supergiants is only about 1.5 million years old. 'O' stars are the brightest and most massive known- about 20 to 100 times larger than the Sun! The lifespan of these hot, blue stars can be as short as 3-6 million years. Melotte 15 is about 7,500 light years away from Earth\r\n\r\nHa : 21 x 1200s ; OIII / SII - 12x1200s ; Total 15 hrs integration time",
