    "description": "This is somewhat artsy experimental rendition of LDN 1250 nebula.\r\n\r\nI decided to create starless version of my previous image, but it looked pretty boring. So I left some of the brightest stars and, since it looked artificial enough, I also gave it a full go with Star Spikes Pro.\r\n\r\nI like its dreamy look - I imagine this is how some kid would imagine a picture of the night sky.\r\n\r\nHope you will like it!)\r\n\r\nData was acquired in 2015 and 2017, full acquisition information can be found under <a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/318951/\">conventional rendition</a> of this object.",
