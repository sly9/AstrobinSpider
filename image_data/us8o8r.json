    "description": "IC1318 - The Gamma Cygni Nebula       (aka Sh2-108)\r\n\r\nEstimated at 5,000 light years distant, the Gamma Cygni region features newly-formed stars, vast streaks of light-blocking dust, and glowing nebula along the plane of our Milky Way. Gamma Cygni, the massive F8 supergiant star located off-center in the frame, actually lies much closer to Earth at only 750 light years. This massive star is 150 times the size of the Sun and forms the center of the constellation Cygnus, the Northern Cross. Due to its bifurcated shape, this portion of the Gammy Cygni nebula is often called the Butterfly Nebula. \r\n\r\nThis image is a combination of 29 hours of camera exposure using a set of narrowband light filters. These filters transmit only a small fraction of visible light wavelengths, each tuned to the wavelengths associated with the energy released by sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, respectively. This “SHO” combination is frequently known as the “Hubble Palette”, originally developed for color mapping of images produced by the Hubble Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nThis image has been drizzled 2x to make up for the native 2.3\"/pixel resolution. I think it did a nice job.",
