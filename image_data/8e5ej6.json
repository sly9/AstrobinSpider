    "description": "Centaurus A is the nearest galaxy with an active nucleus and the nearest Radio galaxy. It is huge with 20x25arcmin but in Radio frequencies it spans 8x4 degrees and is the biggest extragalactical thing up there. Jets are emitted which are partly visible even in this picture, east of the center almost at the outskirts you can find one obscure straight structure. The big halo shows weakly defined shell structures, some of which also can be seen here. There are weak extensions along the axis of symmetry reaching beyond the frame. What an enigmatic beast! I was observing it on every of my journeys to more southern latitudes, and now finally I was able to have it on chip with a pretty capable setup.\r\n\r\nThis is a LRGB with a 10\" f/4 on CGE Pro and ASI1600MMP, taken from the mountain chalet at Rooisand farm in Namibia.  Thanks to Faried of www.deepskysafaris.com for inviting!",
