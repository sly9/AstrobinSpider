    "description": "I wanted to do this object in RGB  for 2 years now.  There were always problems preventing me from getting at it. Most notably my son's cancer that was diagnosed exactly one year ago today.   I finally did it this past week!   \r\nI will print it and offer him the print to celebrate his remission.\r\n\r\n\r\nDone in LRGB in -18C temperature (heck it is a winter DSO afterall  :-)\r\n\r\n4 hours of Luminance  bin 1X1\r\n40 min of each color binned 2X2\r\nAll processed with APP and Photoshop\r\n\r\nEnjoy, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to every one!\r\nCheers!",
