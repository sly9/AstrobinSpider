    "description": "There are names for the four phases of a solar eclipse. The moment that the Moon makes contact with the Sun at the beginning of the eclipse is called the first contact. The second contact is when 100 percent of the the Moonâ€™s disk is over the Sun. At third contact 100 percent of the the Moon is no longer over the Sun. When no part of the Moon is touching the Sun, the eclipse has ended, and fourth contact has arrived. After first contact during the annular eclipse on May 20, 2012, the Sun was in and out of the clouds, and I was worried. At second contact, the sun was totally obscured, and I thought I missed it. Then the winds pushed the clouds to a break. There was a tremendous roar of applause around me on the grassy field at the University of Nevada in Reno, Nevada, USA where over 500 people had gathered to watch the eclipse. Smiling, I quickly re-centered my camera. I caught the third contact.\r\n\r\nShot as video at approximately 15 fps and converted to GIF. This GIF is running at about 10x real time.",
