    "description": "Ever since I learned of the Pelican Nebula Herbig-Haro (HH) Object 555 (HH555), I have been wanting to image this field of view. In order to get higher resolution data near the HH555 object, I imaged only that section with the Celestron EdgeHD 11\" telescope at 1960mm and blended the luminance data into the rest of the image taken with my Stellarvue SVR102-T at 714mm.",
