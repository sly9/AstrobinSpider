    "description": "I had gone up to my astronomy club's observatory to do some maintenance and capture a ton of darks with the club's camera. I had brought my imaging equipment with me in hopes that it was going to clear up and I could capture some good data, as the skies are pretty dark there. Hours went by and the temperature started dropping well below freezing and the clouds were still enough of a pain to image through, so I decided to start wrapping things up and go home. I was about to get in my car when I noticed a glow to the north...then a pillar....then another pillar! I quick set up my tripod and camera and started firing off shots. From about 3 am till sunrise I was witness to one of the best aurora shows I had seen since the big storm of 1989. Lots of movement from NE to NW, pillars, curtains, it was a sight to behold. Above is one of my favorite shots.",
