    "description": "I decided here for new luminance data from the edge 11 HD. The color comes from older data taken with my CT 10. For increasing structure and contrast, I did an inverted multiplication with a starless version in photoshop. This area is stunning for me. With new processing and the resolution of my edge 11, I think I could increase quality. Now waiting for better weather.....\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
