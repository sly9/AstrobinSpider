    "description": "This is my try on the Phantom of the Opera. I selected first 5 minutes exposures, just to find out that this is for this target not enough, there was not enough depth in the image to really make it pop. So I decided to scrub the 5 minute trials and went for 10 minutes, and it was definitely worth it, hence to everybody who wants to take an image of Sh2-173 in suburban skies, 10 minutes with a 6\" refractor seems to be more appropriate. I use my \"standard\" assignment of the 3 narrowband channels to Pseudo RGB. The 2 bright stars in this area do not make life easier either. Still, I am happy with the result. Once my APO (yes, I decided for a refractor to come in 2021) is here I want to do this object again with real RGB data.\r\nPRGB assignment of the narrowband channels:\r\nR = 45% Ha + 55% SII\r\nG = 10% SII + 20% Ha + 70% OIII\r\nB = 10% Ha + 90% OIII",
