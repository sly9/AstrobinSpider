    "description": "Rework on my Mars from September 2018.\r\nOn 05.09.2018 the seeing was good, at that time I just did not know that. I took a total of 8 x 60 seconds, of which only 60 seconds were used in this image. Since I am not really a luminaire in planetary editing, I have used the processing techniques of deep-sky image editing. The result is to my taste more appealing than my first processing a year ago. Maybe it seems a bit too high-contrast, but I wanted to achieve a slight 3D effect. Personally, I am very satisfied with the result of my 6-inch Newton - which at the time was probably not good adjusted.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it!\r\n\r\nSkywatcher 150/750 PDS\r\nZWO ASI120 MC-S\r\nSkywatcher 3x Barlow\r\n1,5 Drizzle",
