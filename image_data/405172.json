    "description": "I don't believe all deep space images look good starless, but in this particular case there was a lot of background Ha partially obscured by a pretty thick star field. Unfortunately I had to reprocess everything all over gain, as I had originally ran deconvolution in PixInsight. Nikita's StarNet++ does not work so well with deconvoluted images due to the variations in how each person handles the process. So despite how well StarNet++ works, in my case it took some time. \r\n\r\nCTB1 is a nearby supernova remnant (SNR) with an apparent diameter of about a half a degree (about the same size as a Full Moon). Upon early discovery, CTB1 was thought to be a planetary nebula, so Abell included it in his catalog of planetary nebulae as Abell 85. It was identified as a SNR by van den Bergh et al. in 1972 based upon its optical half-circular shape consisting of radiative filaments. Deeper images taken in H-alpha by Fesen (1993) show that it has a complete circular shape except for the unusual breakout structure toward the northeast, which also shows up in X-Ray images. Distance and age estimates are 10,000 light years, and 7,500 â€“ 11,000 years, respectively. It spans nearly 100 light years.",
