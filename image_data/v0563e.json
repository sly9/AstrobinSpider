    "description": "Adding some additional data to an older version of that iconic galaxy.I wasn't really happy with the old one because of blown stars and processing artefacts. My goal was to increase detail and structure and not caring about IFN. There are still some spikes visible because of the cable holder cross in the dew cap for the hyperstar function in the older data. The additional shots were without this cross. Hope you like the new and finer version.\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
