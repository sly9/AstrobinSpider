    "description": "Returning to two old favorites of mine, the Lagoon and Trifid nebulas.  This latest image captures these two beautiful nebulas with a bit more imaging knowledge, and new equipment.\r\nAt the beginning of my AstroBin gallery, these two are first seen as captured on film back in the early 1980's.\r\nIn 2019 I imaged them as part of my very first attempts at digital astrophotography.  Taken in Death Valley and using the same 1970-1980's era telescope and mount, and short exposures and pure manual guiding.\r\nThis last image has them both captured in a single image using my 6\"f4 Newtonian and autoguiding on the Paramount MYT.  Image was taken from William's Hill under Bortle 3 skies.\r\nThese two nebulas are a joy to image and process, very bright and colorful.",
