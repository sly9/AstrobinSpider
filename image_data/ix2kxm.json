    "description": "NB image (mostly bicolor), where the SII data was partially blended with H-alpha and OIII in the R and G channels to enrich the tonality. The main goal was to attain the maximum resolution possible with my setup, with attention to the trapezium region. Conditions were variable during acquisition, but fortunately enjoyed a couple of windows of good seeing.",
