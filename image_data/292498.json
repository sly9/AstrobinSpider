    "description": "I decided that tonight I would try and image M97 and M108 in the same field of view.   The sky\r\nwas not perfect.  It had a dim haziness for lack of a better description and there were scattered\r\nclouds.  However there were no clouds where I wanted to image.   I found  M97 and M108\r\nquickly and took a test image to check my framing.  I did not like the framing so I adjusted my\r\nscope and took another test image.  This time the framing was acceptable.  I began imaging.  I\r\nintended on taking at least 40 light frames but if the sky permitted I was going to try for 60 to a\r\n100 light frames hoping that this would produce an image with less noise.   However as is my usual\r\nlately when I got to light frame 13 the image was brighter, pink colored, and hardly anything\r\ncould be seen in the image.   I moved away from the glare of my computer screen and looked \r\nat the sky.  The entire sky was now clouded over.  So I only had 12 light frames to work with.  I\r\nfelt that noise would be an issue and my assumption was correct.   I had captured a fair amount\r\nof detail and color in both M108 and M97.   The post processing took a while and most of my\r\n time was spent trying to eliminate the noise.  Finally I came up with an image that I consider\r\nacceptable.  It is not exceptional but I'll take it.  As usual I'm long winded.   However with all\r\nof that said this is my first attempt at imaging M97 and M108 in the same field of view.  Please\r\nenjoy. ",
