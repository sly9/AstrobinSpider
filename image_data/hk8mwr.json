    "description": "This region of the sky is dominated by dark nebulae, molecular clouds and dense cores. Additionally, the are a few background galaxies. The prominent catalog item in this image is the molecular cloud MBM 56 (Magnani+Blitz+Mundy catalog). There are  six objects from the PGCC catalog (Planck Catalogue of Galactic Cold Clumps). A few background galaxies are seen in this image - none have any studied distance estimates. These objects and some bright stars are identified in the <a href=\"http://www.jthommes.com/Astro/images/LBN467-470_MN152_PI-PS2_annotated.jpg\">annotated image</a>.  There are also a number of background galaxies in this field not identified in the annotation.   Horizontal FOV is approximately 88 arc minutes (1.88 arcsec/pix image scale on the full size image).",
