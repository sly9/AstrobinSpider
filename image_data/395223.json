    "description": "APOD - May 1, 2019 ........  My first APOD so I'm pretty excited. \r\n\r\nSince having given up astro-imaging for health reasons and selling  my gear, I am finding real joy in processing some of Hubble's amazing image data such as this one,  the Cat's Eye Nebula also known as NGC 6543. I am grateful that NASA has given the public free access to their Hubble Legacy Archive which is chucked full of amazing stuff! Thank you NASA!\r\n\r\nThe Cat's Eye Nebula was one of the first planetary nebulae to be discovered and is one of the most complex planetary nebulae ever seen. Planetary nebulae form when Sun-like stars gently eject their outer gaseous layers, creating amazing shapes. The Cat's Eye Nebula, also known as NGC 6543, is a visual \"fossil record\" of the dynamics and late evolution of a dying star. It is estimated to be 1,000 years old.  (Technical info from NASA Hubble Space project)\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Hubble Space Telescope (downloaded from the Hubble Legacy Archive)\r\nData preprocessing: Chandra X-Ray Data at Harvard University\r\nData processing: Rudy Pohl\r\n\r\nI downloaded pre-processed data from: chandra.harvard.edu/photo/openFITS/multiwavelength_data.html\r\n\r\nColour mapping/channel combination done in Pixinisght using Pixelmath:\r\n- NGC 6543 Chandra X-ray (Magenta)\r\n- NGC 6543 Hubble Optical - ACS F502N (Blue)\r\n- NGC 6543 Hubble Optical - ACS F505N (Green)\r\n- NGC 6543 Hubble Optical - ACS F658N (Red)\r\n\r\nSoftware: \r\nPixinsight 1.8, Photoshop CS5",
