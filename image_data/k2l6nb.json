    "description": "This is M42, the Great Orion Nebula and its close companion, M43, De Mairan’s Nebula (on the far left). At 1,344 light years away, it’s easily visible with the naked eye as a bright blob in Orion’s Sword (just below Orion’s Belt). And this thing is a star factory!\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the stars to come from that factory are the four main stars of the Trapezium, creatively dubbed A, B, C, and D. They are visible in this picture but hard to pick out because of the brightness of the emission nebula’s central region. Ironically, they are very prevalent when viewing the nebula visually through an eyepiece because the frequencies of bright blue light they give off are more compatible with our eyes than the rest of the nebula, which appears to be a cloudy gray to our eyes.\r\n\r\nBut put a camera on it, and all sorts of gorgeous colors and textures come through. We shot this at the full 2800mm focal length of the C11. So we couldn’t get the whole thing in the frame—but I think we compensated for that by capturing a great deal of detail.",
