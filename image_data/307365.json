    "description": "Image taken for fun with my friend Sebastiano Recupero (http://www.astrobin.com/users/mesone/) with my new Nikon D750 camera and a Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 G lens. We wanted to test it on the night sky. We decided to go to a place not so far from home and we took 81 x 30s exposures on the Milky Way, using a Nano Tracker to avoid blurred stars, and a single 30s exposure without sideral tracking for the landscape. \r\nMany thanks to Sebastiano and to his strong experience with Pixinsight :)\r\n",
