    "description": "The protagonists of this image are those reddish clouds composed of Hydrogen Alpha that surround M31, although in order to reveal those clouds I had to squeeze the Ha data to the maximum.\r\n\r\nAfter misinterpreting the data and deleting it because it didn't seem right to show an image that had little to do with reality, I decided to reprocess the Ha image from scratch, after trying to reveal it in different ways I decided to re-select the data again Ha, make a new flat master and make a severe cut to the image to try to deal with the vignette that had fooled me in the previous result, after about 10 hours of work I finally got the desired result, again I apologize for My previous erroneous result and I hope you like this new result even if the size is reduced.\r\n\r\nAlberto Pisabarro.",
