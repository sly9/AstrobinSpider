    "description": "The Ha data was so good, the best I have ever had.  The RASA with around 200 minutes of data is fantastic.  Just wish I had more clear sky hours.  I just love the BW Ha data.  I think the SII data would either look wonderful separately or supplementing the Ha.  I just did not get enough SII data.  \r\n\r\nI discuss techniques and artistic decisions in the video linked above.  Thanks and clear skies.",
