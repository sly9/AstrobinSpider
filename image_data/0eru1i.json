    "description": "This is roughly the \"upper\" half of Barnard's Loop, Sh2-276, in Ha. The subs as they came down were in horizontal mode, with LDN 1622, the Boogie Man Nebula [top just left of center], on his head. When we typically look at the area around Orion the Loop is in a vertical orientation, to the \"left \"of the main constellation stars. I rotated the final image to this more typical and familiar vertical position. The poor Boogie Man is now sideways, but it is space, after all...no real up or down.\r\nI am about to hopefully be able to add a filter wheel to this setup and not use a filter drawer, so plan to gather OIII and perhaps SII data for further presentations.\r\n\r\n...Stephen\r\n\r\ncapture:\r\nSigma 135 f/1.8 Art @ f/3.5\r\nASI 1600MM cooled\r\nBaader Ha3.5nm filter\r\nParamount MX+\r\n\r\nguiding:\r\nWilliam Optics 50 x 200 guide scope\r\nASI 290 M Mini guider\r\n\r\nTheSkyX, SGP, PHD2\r\nPixInsight, Topaz deNoise AI, Preview\r\n[30] 600s guided subs\r\n5 hours integration",
