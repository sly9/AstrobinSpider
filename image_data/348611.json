    "description": "This didn't come out 100% as I'd hoped, but f/8 under heavy light pollution and/or with narrowband is just difficult! I think I might need to rethink this setup - I do have the CCDTV67 reducer, but I haven't used it yet. I think what I need to do is pair it with the IMX183 to get the magnification I want with it - I just don't know when I can get the monochrome version of that sensor. I'd probably permanently bin it to keep from oversampling. I have two more targets with this scope and then I'm putting my Newt back up. Can't wait!\r\n\r\nForgot to say: Thanks to Jeff Bax (https://www.astrobin.com/users/jeffbax/) for giving me some good tips during acquisition as well as to Jonas Illner (https://www.astrobin.com/users/Jonas242/) and Jarrett Trezzo (https://www.astrobin.com/users/jtrezzo/) for some invaluable constructive criticism on the processing.",
