    "description": "Scattered across the heavens are so many fascinating wonders depicting the enormous beauty of Godâ€™s presence and despite the power portrayed in some of these images it only is a glimpse of what they truly resemble up close. This is an image of another star forming region resembling fighting dragons glowing in red Hydrogen energy. Stars of all sorts reside here mostly quite young, only a few million years old. Located in the constellation Ara some 4000 light years away it is one of the closest to us spanning 600 light years across, twice that of the carina nebulae. If your imagination is vivid enough you may even see hands rather than dragons trying to cling together, at which point I call it the Hand of God nebulae, glorious and eternal. \r\n\r\nClose to the bottom of the image is an O-type star some 40 times bigger than our sun and shedding its layers into space preparing itself for a massive Supernova explosion in appx 3-4 million years. I have captured it thru my bigger telescope which has much more magnifying power.",
