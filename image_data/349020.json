    "description": "One of the imagers who regularly looks at my photographs, used some of the free data from Misti Mountain Observatory, and so I thought I would use Jim Misti's data too - a great find as I had never come across his site before. It is so kind of Jim to provide us with such wonderful data through his 32\" Ritchey-Chretien telescope! This image comprises of 15 luminances at 5 minutes long each, plus 3 subs at 5 minutes each in RGB. That is all! So, Image Acquisition by Jim Misti.",
