    "description": "This likeness of a blue heron, with its beak reaching out to spear a nearby fish, is comprised of 3 galaxies - two galaxies which are gravitationally merging, plus a background galaxy. The merging galaxies, known as Arp 84, are located 165 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of Canes Venatici (The Hunting Dogs) at a declination of +37 degrees.  I see many herons during the daytime at my house and I can attest that this nickname is visually appropriate.  \r\n\r\nThe structure of each of these galaxies is incredible.  The larger galaxy (NGC 5395) is an elongated, face-on spiral galaxy which is asymmetric and distorted due to interaction with its nearby companion. The dominant spiral arm of this galaxy forms two complete rings around the core. A large vertical dark dust lane is bisecting the right side of the galaxy.  \r\n\r\nThe smaller galaxy (NGC 5394) is also a face-on galaxy. It has an oval disk, two long symmetric arms, and very bright inner spiral arms. \r\n\r\nIt is interesting that both of these galaxies appear to be face-on.  The cores of these two galaxies are separated by 2 arc-minutes (about 100,000 light years, the diameter of our Milky Way).  For both galaxies, I like the color contrast between the outer reaches of the galaxy arms (blue) and the core / inner regions (yellow).\r\n\r\nAlso seen in this image are many background galaxies, including the \"fish\" (PGC 2101092).",
