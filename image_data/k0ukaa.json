    "description": "Last Image I will post with this scope. I have sold it now and plan to image exclusively with my takahashi tsa-120. It was an ok scope but one I will never take advantage of in my skies. the .97\" resolution of the takahashi will be sufficient for any sky quality I have throughout the year.\r\nI had a lot of frustrating nights when the seeing was poor, similar to some nights I had with the 10\" newt. Problems I never encountered with the 8\" RC.",
