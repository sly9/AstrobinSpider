    "description": "The image above shows the measured light-curves of the  Exoplanet CoRoT-18b and the Variable star ASASSN-V J063307.38-000204.9 did on January 11 2021.\r\nCoRoT-18b is the fourth transiting  Exoplanet measured by me ðŸ˜Š\r\n\r\nExoplanet CoRoT-18b is a Hot Jupiter class planet located in the constellation Monoceros, found by the CoRoT space telescope in 2011\r\nRadius : 1,3 Jupiter\r\nMass : 3,4 Jupiter\r\nOrbital period : 1,9 day\r\nThe host Star is a Sun-like star with Radius of 1 x Sun.\r\n\r\nVariable star ASASSN-V J063307.38-000204.9\r\nW Ursae Majoris-type eclipsing variable\r\nPeriod : 9.2 hour\r\nAmplitude : 0,7 Mag (measured by me) is a pretty high value.\r\nI made a gif (Rev. D) where the brightness difference is very good to see.\r\nThe gif contains 2 raw images of 2 minutes (maxima and minima ).\r\nThe elapsed time between the two images is approx. 1 hour",
