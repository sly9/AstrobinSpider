    "description": "I collaborated with Luke Gulliver based in WA to produce this set from November 20th. Being based in NSW I am imaging Mars at its maximum altitude about 2 hours earlier than Luke and it was fortunate that between us we got coverage for most of the extent of the dust storm.\r\n\r\nThese images are taken ~ 2.5 hours apart and it is nice to see how well they are matched in terms of colour and general appearance. \r\n\r\nI produced a reasonable planetary map from our images, with the rest of the planet derived from images produced earlier in the apparition. Although the coverage is not complete, it does give a good idea of the extent of the dust storm. We may have missed some of the western periphery of the dust but it is fairly diffuse by then I believe.\r\n\r\nFrom the planetary map I texturised the WinJUPOS graphic and produced this .avi animation of the planet rotating, which makes it fairly easy to see the spread of the dust.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nyevbybpisdszvr/2020-11-22-0034.0-Mars-NR.avi?dl=0\r\n\r\nIt was great to do this project together with Luke.",
