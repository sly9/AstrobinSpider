    "description": "Data acquisition: Hubble Legacy Archive, NASA\r\nData processing: Rudy Pohl\r\nFilters used: Ha - Green, OIII - Blue, SII - Red\r\nRGB image processed with the Hubble Palette \r\n\r\nThis iconic Hubble image was named by NASA scientists \"Pillars of Creation\" and is easily the most well known and recognizable image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. This photograph was taken in a region of the Eagle Nebula (Messier 16), known as the Elephant Trunks and is composed of interstellar gas and dust some 6,500â€“7,000 light years from Earth. (Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nI remember seeing and marveling at this image and others like it about 25 years ago, but never did I imagine that I would one day be handling this raw data from the Hubble itself and would be processing it myself! I consider it to be a real privilege to be permitted access to this awesome data archive. Thank you NASA!\r\n\r\nYes, I know that this image has been done by so many people so many times that some consider it totally boring.... but not me! I think it's still as awesome as the day I first saw it!",
