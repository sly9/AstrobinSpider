    "description": "This image was really just a test for me to try out the Rainbow Astro RST-135 using a longer focal length scope and heavier payload. This telescope and camera gear are around 32lbs. Guiding was a consistent .6-.7 RMS for the entire night. I'm pretty happy with the results. The mount performed well.",
