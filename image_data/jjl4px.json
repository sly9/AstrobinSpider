    "description": "Working on a full frame version of the iconic orion nebula as a team work, I start here with a crop of the core region. Merging together older data of my CT 10 together with newer of my edge 11 HD. I 've tried to give the whole thing a quite natural look with not overdoing processing as well as I could and see it as a first try. Exposure time above is only for the new data.Hope you like it...\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
