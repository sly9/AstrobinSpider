    "description": "I had a little mishap with my flockboard during capture that caused a few issues, most of which I just cropped out, but it still left me with some strange star colors. Special thanks to Jarrett Trezzo for pointing out exactly what the main issue was there - I fixed it as much as possible. I had trouble bringing out the fainter strands of hydrogen and oxygen, but at least I got something there. I'm satisfied overall, but there's room for improvement. Maybe I'll come back one day?",
