    "description": "Sharpless 215 has, like other objects in the Sharpless Catalog, been classified as an HII emission nebula. My good friend Dana Patchick recently spotted a hot star apparently located within the nebula, and suggested that it could possibly be a planetary nebula.  He suggested that I turn my scopes on it, looking for any OIII emission.  Although much fainter than the HII emission, I found a strong OIII signal which is characteristic of planetary nebulae.  Two spectra have been produced based on this image, and as a result this has just been confirmed to be a true planetary nebula.  Dana has registered it as a planetary nebula in his catalog as Pa 167.",
