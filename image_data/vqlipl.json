    "description": "Here's my final version of M63 and its tidal stream. The fact that this galaxy does in fact have a tidal stream is well known, but the extent of it varies from image to image.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing some very deep images of this region, I decided that this should be the first project for my new RASA. After all this is what these telescopes were made for - getting incredibly deep views.\r\n\r\nProcessing this image really was a challenge, I had to learn a whole bunch of new techniques to deal with the faintness (is that a word?) of the stream. But in the end something I like came out and I am very happy with it. Feel free to zoom in, 400mm focal length is more than enough for some nice galaxy details!",
