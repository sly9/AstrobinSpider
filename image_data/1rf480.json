    "description": "I feel this is one of my best images of Saturn from the 27th of May, courtesy of absolutely fantastic seeing. I don’t often see the Encke Division (the thin black line in the outer A-Ring) resolved in the blue images, so that was a measure of the conditions. The Maxwell Gap in the C-ring is clearly visible on both sides of the planet and this is the best resolution of this feature that I've ever achieved. It is the thin black line on the outer edge of the inner C-ring…also known as the crepe ring.\r\nThe polar hexagon is also very clear and there are quite a number of features, albeit subtle, visible across the planet’s disk particularly in the NPR. There are a few bright spots in the hexagon itself particularly on the p side.",
