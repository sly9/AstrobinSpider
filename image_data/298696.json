    "description": "Almost a month with no clear skies here in the south, but when I open up a little there I am capturing whatever is possible. Even having to get up at 6:00 a.m. did not resist and stayed until midnight to do this capture of Saturn.\r\nA photo with almost everything you have right, very visible tracks, Cassini and Encke Division, weak but present Ring C and even the famous polar hexagon.\r\nThe snag was due to the excessive turbulence that caused the planet to jump too much and caused that edge ring where the north pole is lying in the Cassini Division, but nothing that greatly dismantles this beautiful astrophoto.",
