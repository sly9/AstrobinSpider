    "description": "M1 - crab nebula\r\nI acquired this image from my backyard during a single night while testing the new setup with RC8 scope, ASi174MM as a guide camera, and N.I.N.A for acquisition. I was impressed with the details one was able to see using narrowband filters in such light-polluted skies. This target is ideal for NB imaging because of its strong SHO response.\r\n\r\nI was listening to the Beatlesâ€™ \"Lucy in the sky with diamonds\" while I imaged this target. Perhaps John Lennon was thinking of this nebula when writing this song :)",
