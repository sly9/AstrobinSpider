    "description": "Having been inspired by Gendler and Ivan Eder, Steve and I have set out to capture the OIII blue shockwave of Cygnus X-1 and the stunningly beautiful Tulip nebula in this two panel mosaic.\r\n\r\nWe began imaging on 14th May and extended the framing to include the second panel for the arc of the blackhole's shockwave.  In addition we have also added data from Steve's image when he first acquired his TEC and taken from his home observatory, thus boosting the data in panel 1 (the Tulip itself).\r\n\r\nFrom APOD's commentary to Ivan Eder's superb image: \"Framing a bright emission region, this telescopic view looks out along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy toward the nebula rich constellation Cygnus the Swan. Popularly called the Tulip Nebula, the reddish glowing cloud of interstellar gas and dust is also found in the 1959 catalog by astronomer Stewart Sharpless as Sh2-101. About 8,000 light-years distant and 70 light-years across the complex and beautiful nebula blossoms at the center of this composite image. Ultraviolet radiation from young energetic stars at the edge of the Cygnus OB3 association, including O star HDE 227018, ionizes the atoms and powers the emission from the Tulip Nebula. HDE 227018 is the bright star near the center of the nebula. Also framed in the field of view is microquasar Cygnus X-1, one of the strongest X-ray sources in planet Earth's sky. Driven by powerful jets from a black hole accretion disk, its fainter visible curved shock front lies above and right, just beyond the cosmic Tulip's petals.\"\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Mine\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
