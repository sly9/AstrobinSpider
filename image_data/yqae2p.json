    "description": "A fun fact:\r\n\r\nOn the cropped picture (version C) there is (to my knowledge) the farthest object I managed to capture so far: QSO [HB89] 1256+280. With a red shift of 2.66, this quasar is at a distance of about 11.3 +/-1 billion light years. When the light of this quasar left its source, the universe was at a young age of 2 bilion years and we still had to wait 7 billion years for our solar system to be born.",
