    "description": "Reprocessed Olympus Mons image from September 11 with drizzle and WinJUPOS treatment. Due to variable seeing I had to derotate a longer period this time (15 minutes). Was imaging for 43 minutes out of which only 19 were usable.\r\n\r\nThe image compares non-drizzle (top) and drizzle (bottom row) WinJUPOS composites consisting of three 180 second AS!2 stacks. Capture midpoint is at 7:02 pm with sunset taking place at 5:51 pm local time.\r\n\r\nOlympus Mons and three Tharsis volcanoes display a slight pinkish hue while western portion of the SPC is covered by a thick dust cloud. Mare Sirenum and a dark circular feature east of Phaethontis region are also on view. Solis Lacus is setting over the eastern limb.",
