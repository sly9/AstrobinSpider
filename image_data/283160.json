    "description": "First Light for my new FSQ106 EDXIII with reducer at F3.6.  The Ha image is an integration of subs as I set the reducer and its grub screws (argh!), rotation angle of the QSI683 and also filter offsets for auto focusing.  You can see edge artefacts arising from the rotation as I set the ccd angle, LOL!  However, this image is simply for my own test.",
