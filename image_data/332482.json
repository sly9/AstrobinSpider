    "description": "12 days Moon, 92 % illuminated.\r\n\r\nVery good seeing indeed, that night!\r\n\r\nThis VISAC has its history. Find it in the Gassendi picture of the same day.\r\n\r\nThe dark background of Mare Insularum contrasts with the bright ray systems from two main craters, Copernicus and Kepler. While side light enhances crater relieves, frontal light enhances the maria ray systems radiating from them.",
