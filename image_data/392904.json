    "description": "The Christmas Tree Cluster (NGC 2264) is the bright, open cluster of stars in the center of the image.  It sits in a region of emission nebulosity, which includes the famous Cone Nebula (towards the bottom).  Both the Christmas Tree Cluster and the Cone Nebula are in the constellation of Monoceros, found just to the east of Orion. This cluster is approximately 2,500 light years away and was discovered by William Herschel in 1784.  I would have liked to gather more data with this image but I have been so limited because of weather this winter, I got a little impatient.",
