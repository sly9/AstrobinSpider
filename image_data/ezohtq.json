    "description": "This is a 20 hour exposure of the western veil nebula taken from my driveway.  I had a series of clear nights and decided to take an extra long exposure.  I really love this one, I think it's my favorite!! The only issue I had is in the corners, there are elongated stars as I'm still experimenting with back focus.  I may add RGB stars to this at a later date but for now this will have to do!  Let me know what you think!",
