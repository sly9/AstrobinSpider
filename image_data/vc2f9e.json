    "description": "After a frustrating session battling marginal transparency and trying to capture the new white cloud outbreak in Jupiter's north tropical zone (NTZ) I turned my telescope in the direction of Saturn.\r\n\r\nTransparency had improved a little by then, although the sky was still a little hazy. Saturn seems to tolerate such skies a little better than Jupiter in my experience, so I was still able to resolve a possible storm towards the bottom edge of the north polar region.\r\n\r\nThis image is a de-rotation of 7 separate image stacks, with the best 12% of frames from a 3 min capture stacked in each  case.",
