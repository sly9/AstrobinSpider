    "description": "A spectacular barred galaxy NGC 4725 with prominent star-forming ring and a more distant spiral galaxy NGC 4712. This LRGB image was captured with the 250 mm f4 Lacerta PhotoNewton and the ZWO ASI183MM Pro camera over multiple nights in March-May 2020. \r\n\r\nThe luminance image is a combination of the native L data and luminance extracted from RGB data. The L data was captured with camera gains 0, 110 and 200, while RGB exposures were taken at gain 110:\r\n\r\nL: 9x300s (Gain 0, bin 1x1), 69x90s (Gain 110, bin 1x1), 113x30s (Gain 200, bin 1x1)\r\nR: 62x180s (Gain 110, bin 1x1)\r\nG: 45x180s (Gain 110, bin 1x1)\r\nB: 41x180s (Gain 110, bin 1x1)\r\n\r\nTotal exposure: 10.8 hours",
