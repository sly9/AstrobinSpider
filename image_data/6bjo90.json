    "description": "A relatively deep image of the Iris Nebula which is nicely framed by the TEC140/QSI690.  The surrounding dust was quite hard to drag out with the relatively slow focal ratio.  After calibrating the colour I observed a pinkish flare around the central star which I have preserved in the final image, though I am not sure if this is real or a processing artefact.\r\n\r\nI am slowly catching up on my processing backlog ;-)\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
