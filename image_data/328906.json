    "description": "I tried a different approach to the Flaming Star than my previous version.  My original plan was to process the Flaming Star Nebula using the Hubble Palette, but since OIII was barely showing up for this object, I decided to toss it out and only go with Ha and SII.  I put Ha in the Red channel at 100%, and SII in the Green and Blue channels at 100%.  I think this is a kinder, gentler Flaming Star than my first one.",
