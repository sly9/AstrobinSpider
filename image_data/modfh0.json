    "description": "So here we have my effort with IC342 The Hidden Galaxy that I had been working on when I had my accident with a portable hard disk.  I had published an intermediate image of this that was about half-processed.  I had thought that I was OK with that but the idea that I had published something that I knew was not good really bothered me.  \r\n\r\nAfter thinking about that for a couple of days I decided to go back and re-acquire my luminance and Ha data.  I heeded some good advice from Barry Wilson and did more Ha than I had done in the original image.\r\n\r\nI was able to salvage the RGB data that I had done for this because it was still on the HDD of my imaging laptop.  \r\n\r\nIn any case, here is the new image of this galaxy.  I find this subject to be a very special target with the beautiful galaxy obscured by the clouds of gas and dust of our own Milky Way.\r\n\r\nI am including both a cropped view and the full image.  I like the full image because I think I caught some faint Hii signal in places.  \r\n\r\nI hope you like it and clear skies and good health to all!  Comments / criticism always welcome...",
