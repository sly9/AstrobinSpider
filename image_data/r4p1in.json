    "description": "Windblown Mystery:\r\n\r\nAlthough not actually blown by a great celestial wind, NGC 3981 certainly looks like it is moving rapidly through space with several of its arms trailing to one side:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.adamblockphotos.com/ngc-3981.html\r\n\r\nThere are very few images of this galaxy published at this moment. It is part of the NGC 4038 group some 65 million light years ago and, like the eponymous set of colliding galaxies, NGC 3981 appears to have interacted strongly with other galaxies- though none in the vicinity seem to be the apparent cause. I hope this is a new view for you showing off the wonders of the Universe.\r\n\r\nData Courtesy of      http://Telescope.live\r\n\r\nThis data and a video recording of me processing it, is available to members of AdamBlockStudios.com .",
