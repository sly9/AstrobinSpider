    "description": "Presented are two Dark Nebula found within the Sagittarius Star Cloud.  These dark areas are clouds of interstellar dust blocking our view of the stars behind.  Five filters were used to create this image. Luminance, Red, Green, and Blue filtered light were combined to create a traditional colour image.  This resulted in an almost uniform blanket of colourful stars across my field.  With the additional data from a Hydrogen-Alpha filter, large areas of red reveal the presence of hydrogen gas.  When combined, the resulting image creates a contrast of Ha against a sea of colourful stars while enhancing the Dark Nebula. \r\n\r\nNear the centre of the image is Barnard 92.   I think it looks like an Anglerfish with its lure dangling in space to entice its prey.    \r\n\r\nBarnard 93 is just to the right.  When I first saw looked at this, I immediately saw a mandril with a huge mane of red.  The long muzzle in the bottom right, two eyes above, and a mane of red flowing upwards.  \r\n\r\nInstruments:\r\n •  10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\n •  Astro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\n •  SBIG STL 11000m\r\n •  FLI Filter Wheel\r\n •  Baader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n •  Astrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\n\r\nExposures Details:\r\n • Lum  42 X 900\r\n • Red 12 X 900\r\n • Green 8 X 900\r\n • Blue 8 X 900\r\n • Ha 78 X 900\r\n\r\nTotal Time: 37 Hours\r\n\r\nThanks for looking\r\n\r\nTerry",
