    "description": "A work in progress, I hope to double the Oiii and Sii exposure on these two panels, and then match the total exposure in two panels below. Each panels comprises one set of the exposure details I've listed. I feel the grainy look suits this subject, but there are amazing details in this nebula that I want to show up close and at the moment it is too noisy for that.\r\n\r\nNGC 6193 are new stars burning bright and hot, after accreting enough gas and dust pushed into sufficient density for gravity to take over, by shockwaves from the supernovae of earlier stars in this region.",
