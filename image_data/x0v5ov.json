    "description": "As an astrophotographer, I was ashamed to say I'd never seriously attempted M31 despite nearly two years of imaging. With M31 ideally positioned, I had to remedy my error; I captured 3.5 hours each on two panels, since I can't fit all of M31 in a single field. Despite some poor color correction in my telescope, I was able to produce a generally satisfactory result. \r\n\r\nThis M31 is my first ever mosaic - pleased to say the stitching process in PixInsight wasn't all too challenging! Though 3.5 hours wasn't really enough (I pushed the data a little too hard), M31 is bright and easy to work with. I hope you enjoy it.",
