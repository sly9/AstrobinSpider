    "description": "The Cave Nebula is a Hydrogen cloud (in the center) with a brighter rim and a star forming region in the large molecular cloud known as Cepheus B. The stars of the Cepheus OB3 association are less than 100,000 years old. Low mass star formation is occurring at a high rate within the dust clouds of Sh2-155. \r\n\r\nThe blue reflection nebula (lower left) is VDB-155.\r\n\r\nJust south (in this image to the left) of the Cave nebula we can see some strange orange Nebulosity, the home of some Herbig Haro Objects. HH168, HH169 and HH174 are locations, where a star is born, still surrounded by dust and nebulosity, already shaped into a rotating disk. This material blocks the light of the new-born stars and the pressure can be released only at the disk poles and Jets of material are escaping from their northern and southern poles. \r\n\r\n\r\nRGB: 72,71,70 x 600 sec bin 1x1: 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 July 2017\r\nHa: 63x 600 sec bin 1x1: 31 Jul, 2,3,4 aug 2017\r\nTotal integration time: 46 hrs.",
