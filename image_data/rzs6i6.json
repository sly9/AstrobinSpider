    "description": "Trying to make the best out of a disappointing galaxy season. Tough year in terms of weather, and I'm also coming to the realization that LRGB imaging from my location is not going to produce the results I'm after. This galaxy season was meant to be the litmus test that determines whether I bother with anything other than narrowband in the future.\r\n\r\nM94 also goes by Cat's Eye Galaxy, and is a tricky target with its faint outer bands. I threw as much time at it as I could over a period of a few months. Still not happy with the colors produced by Photometric Color Calibration, and I foresee a revision over the next few nights. All-in-all thought it turned out as good as I think I can expect from a suburban red zone.",
