    "description": "This image is a reprocess on data obtained in May 2017. This is a narrowband view of the Carina Nebula, shot from a light pollution red zone (Singapore). Although I was lacking SII and OIII data (only have 30 minutes of each), and overwhelming HA Data (2.5 hours in total), I managed to process the channels sufficiently for a hubble palette mapping. This is the final result, after many iterations of processing, and I think I am very happy with the result. \r\n\r\nDo view it at full resolution to have a closer look at the intricate gas clouds. ",
