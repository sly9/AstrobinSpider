    "description": "SQM hit 22.13 on this night and the Gegenschien was huge. Zodiacal band was the widest i have ever seen it - the whole ecliptic plane was blazingly bright. The zodiacal light was insane as you can see in the image. The shot was exposed about 1 hour after astronomical darkness.\r\n\r\nShot during the September 2019 Equinox in the Khomas region of Namibia in the heart of the Kalahari desert.\r\n\r\nSigma Art 14mm @ f/2.0\r\n30 x 1 minute exposure\r\nISO 1600\r\nAndy Ellis modded Canon 6D MkII\r\nFornax LightTrack\r\nCalibrated in RawTherapee, processed in PixInsight.\r\n\r\nIt was my first time using the Sigma Art 14mm f/1.8 and i will most likely come down a stop to f/2.8 in future - maybe even go to f/4.0 to really clean things up.",
