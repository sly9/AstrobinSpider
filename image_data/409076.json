    "description": "A fascinating area in Cygnus, as it contains some very interesting objects (for object identification please have a look at the annotated vsersion):\r\n\r\nIC 1311, a dense open cluster embedded in an area of abundant emission nebulosity, was discovered by Thomas Espin in 1893. It fits nicely in this FOV. The brightest part of this nebula is listed in Lynd's Bright Nebulae as number 239 (DWB 55) and is part of the much larger IC 1318A nebula.\r\n\r\nPatchick 6 (DSH J2009.6+4114): Probable Planetary Nebula, discovered by amateur astronomer Dana Patchick on POSS plates. As far as I could find out, this object is not listed in any catalogue to date.\r\n\r\nDO 2: In 1966, Russian astronomer Madona V. Dolidze at the Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory located in Georgia, created a catalog of 57 small open star clusters. Dolidze 2 is not a true physical cluster, so it is rather an asterism.\r\n\r\nCircular structure around TYC 3155-1523-1 (HD 191944, SAO 49274): This was suspected to be an old PN, but it turned out that it is very unlikely a PN.\r\n\r\nBarnard 342 (LDN 885) is just one of many dark clouds in this area, some bright nebulae are listed in the DWB catalogue.\r\n\r\nShort nights, a busy time in the job, accummulated lack of sleep and the fact, that I am running out of time led to little integration time, so I had to stretch and denoise this picture more aggressively than I would have liked. While from a technical point of view this is not my best picture, I still feel that it might be acceptable as it features some nice objects. HA was done with the ASI 1600, RGB with the Canon. The picture was resized to 80 % to hide the worst flaws ;-)\r\n\r\nMost probably this is going to be my last image for a while, as once more I am about to spent the next months on a sailing boat. I am looking forward to be back on AB when returning home in autumn. If you reach that point of this long description, I'd like to thank you for your patience. Have a great summer!",
