    "description": "A renewed attempt to control my telescope that's just too large for my mount and image a galaxy. Lo and behold, NGC 1365. 51 frames of the 93 taken were acceptable enough for pixinsight to want to star align them with the loosest settings possible. It's definitely a subject I want to return to once I got a better setup!",
