    "description": "This Intermediate spiral galaxies is one of my favorite Messier objects.  I hope to image as many of then ARP galaxies as possible because they each tell an interesting story through their irregular shapes. 5 min exposures limit the number of subs I can take in a night given my landscape restrictions.  I plan on adding as many more subs as possible.",
