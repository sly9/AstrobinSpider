    "description": "Mistakenly catalogued as an HII region, and included in the Sharpless catalogue, this area of dust in Hercules is in fact an example of an integrated flux nebula - shining only through combined light of stars in our own galaxy reflected back to us. Also catalogued as LBN 105/106, MBM 40 and IREC 53.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of faint, small background galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters in the image - the annotated revision highlights some of these from the PGC/LEDA catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe data channel amounts look a little odd as quite a lot of frames were affected by high thin cloud!\r\n\r\nImage Capture: P Tribe, G Coates\r\nProcessing: G Coates",
