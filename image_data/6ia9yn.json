    "description": "Five consecutive nights of mostly clear skies have allowed me to capture this M 13 from the home backyard. I did not expect this result, considering I am located at the outskirts of Madrid. I have had quite a hard time removing sky gradients.  I am very happy with the globular result, but the aspect I like the most of the resulting image is the amount of galaxies that can be seen scattered around the image. (that is why I added a side image B with some of them annotated)\r\n\r\nHope you like it. \r\n\r\nGuillermo\r\n\r\n\r\nCapturing data: (@ gain 139)\r\nLum: 503x10s + 318x30s + 57x120s +30x300s\r\nRed:181x30s+ 31x120s\r\nGreen: 162 x 30s + 31x120s\r\nBlue: 170 x 30s + 33x120s",
