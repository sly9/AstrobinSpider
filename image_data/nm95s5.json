    "description": "This is a 26-panel mosaic of the Orion constellation, or at least most of it. It could have been done in 20 panels, but I'm not very good at aligning panels and had to go back and shoot some more to fill in gaps. Shot with my modded Canon 600D, iEXOS-100, and Rokinon 135mm f/2 at f/2.4. I used 2-minute subs for each panel, plus a handful of 20-second subs for the Orion nebula, but didn't really use them as it made the composition look weird without the nebula being much brighter than the surrounding dust. Subs were guided in PHD2, dithered every three frames. Bortle 3 skies.\r\n\r\nThe panels were shot from January through March of 2021, individually integrated in Astro Pixel Processor, and then assembled into the mosaic in APP. I had to group it into sections and then combine the sections, and then reduced the overall file size to 0.75X as I ran out of RAM to work on the entire FOV. Stars reduced in Starnet++,  and recombined with final adjustments in GIMP.\r\n\r\nAs always, C&C welcome and appreciated!\r\n\r\nV2 will be a JPG with a much smaller file size...\r\n\r\n-Todd",
