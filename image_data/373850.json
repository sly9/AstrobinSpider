    "description": "A very beautiful molecular dust cloud in the 'king' of constellations Cepheus.  A great target to image with much to concentrate on when processing.  Quite striking dark dust absorbs the light from the starfield . . . subject too of Steve's APOD of the same data: \"Light-years across, this suggestive shape known as the Seahorse Nebula appears in silhouette against a rich, luminous background of stars. Seen toward the royal northern constellation of Cepheus, the dusty, obscuring clouds are part of a Milky Way molecular cloud some 1,200 light-years distant. It is also listed as Barnard 150 (B150), one of 182 dark markings of the sky cataloged in the early 20th century by astronomer E. E. Barnard. Packs of low mass stars are forming within from collapsing cores only visible at long infrared wavelengths. Still, colorful stars in Cepheus add to the pretty, galactic skyscape.\"\r\n\r\nImage acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne.\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
