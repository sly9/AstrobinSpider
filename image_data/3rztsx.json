    "description": "Jupiter on the morning of Sat 30 May 2020 AEST.\r\n\r\nLast of three WinJUPOS composites acquired on the night.  I returned to Jupiter after half an hour Mars session to capture the GRS region but the seeing was no longer as good due to gathering fog.  Transparency decreased significantly at the end of imaging run prompting me to park the scope.  Period covered here is between 5:12 and 5:23 am.",
