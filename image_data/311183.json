    "description": "The Western Veil Nebula (a.k.a. Caldwell 34, NGC 6960) also goes by the following other names: \"Witch's Broom\", \"Finger of God\", or \"Filamentary Nebula\".  The entire Veil Nebula complex is a cloud of heated and ionized gas and dust in the constellation Cygnus. It constitutes a large but relatively faint supernova remnant which exploded about 3,000 BC to 6,000 BC.  It is estimated to be at a distance of 1,470 light-years from the sun and has expanded to about 6 times the diameter of moon (source: wikipedia).\r\n\r\nI imaged the Eastern Veil (NGC 6992) last year and decided to go on the other side this year.  The imaging session went pretty well and managed to get approximately four hours over two nights.  The difference in imaging between this and last year is I used a UHC clip filter which made the nebula stand out more than without the filter. \r\n\r\nhttps://kurtzeppetello.smugmug.com/",
