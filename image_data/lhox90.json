    "description": "Imaged on nights of 10-9-2020, 10-10-2020, 10-11-2020, 10-12-2020, 10-13-2020, 10-14-2020.\r\n \r\nAbell 10 is another very small planetary nebula, measuring only 35 arc seconds in diameter or .6 arc minutes.  It is, however, very easy to image since it is a very bright PN.  So bright that just an RGB image gives a very strong impression.  So it is surprising to me that there are only 2 other images of this PN on Astribin.  My image has been enhanced with both Ha and Oiii, which are both very strong.  It has a very interesting structure with a strong central Oiii surrounded by a scalloped ring of strong Ha.",
