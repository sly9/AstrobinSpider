    "description": "Messier 17 is a bright diffuse nebula in Sagittarius. Know as Omega, Swan, or Horseshoe. 5000-6000 light years distant, the visible portion is about 15 light years across. \r\n\r\nI first saw this doing visual observing with a 9.25\" SCT. The Omega symbol or Horseshoe was readily discerned. When I took up astrophotography, it was one of my first targets. I never really saw the \"swan\" in the image, until this particular image. I was always looking at the bright portion of the nebula, but now I see the swan as the dark structure along the bottom of this image, framed by the bright nebulae.\r\n\r\nCaptured 6/20, 7/2, and 7/3/2021\r\nHa, OIII, SII each 24 x 420\", gain 100, offset 50, camera temperature -5C",
