    "description": "I used the very high quality individual captures from 7 RGB runs to make this animation showing Ganymede and Europa in transit and Io just emerging from being occulted by Jupiter.\r\nEuropa is easier to see as it moves in front of the planet than in the still image I posted earlier. It is a light pink colour with a bluish limb to the right and can be found near the very bright outbreak in the NEB. This action takes place in just over 20 mins.",
