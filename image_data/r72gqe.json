    "description": "This is an image of one wing of the Seagull nebula where CED 90 and NGC 2327 are located.  All kinds of cool details here along with many reflection nebula and emission objects.  Its a follow up to an image I took last year but with a much larger field of view and more sensitive camera.  The image was taken over two nights at a private astronomy ranch in S. FL last week.  Its a LRGB and Ha composite with 10.2 hrs of exposure time.",
