    "description": "NGC 2264 is the designation number of the New General Catalogue that identifies two astronomical objects as a single object:\r\n•\tthe Cone Nebula,\r\n•\tthe Christmas Tree Cluster,\r\nTwo other objects are within this designation but not officially included:\r\n•\tSnowflake Cluster,\r\n•\tand the Fox Fur Nebula.\r\nAll of the objects are located in the Monoceros constellation and are located about 800 parsecs or 2600 light-years from Earth.\r\nNGC 2264 is sometimes referred to as the Christmas Tree Cluster and the Cone Nebula. However, the designation of NGC 2264 in the New General Catalogue refers to both objects and not the cluster alone.\r\n\r\nHSO was choosed because of warmer colors ;-)",
