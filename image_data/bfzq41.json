    "description": "The Topsy Turvy is a spectacular example of galactic collision.  NGC 1313 began as a barred spiral galaxy, but its violent encounter with another galaxy completely rearranged its structure. That collision also created scattered areas of intense star formation. Topsy Turvy hosts a rare celestial object—an intermediate mass black hole.\r\n\r\nNGC 1313 is surrounded by larges areas of faint dust. In this image I chose not to include the dust, but instead to concentrate on the dramatic interior features of the galaxy. \r\n\r\nThis is an RGB image processed with a synthetic luminance. It is a complete reprocessing of data collected in January, 2019.\r\n\r\nTech Notes for ASA 500/3.6:\r\nASA Newtonian, 500 mm aperture, 1900mm focal length, F3.6\r\nFLI Proline 16803, 9 mm pixel, 4096 X 4096\r\nASA DDM85 equatorial mount\r\nProcessing with PixInsight, StarTools, and Affinity Photo",
