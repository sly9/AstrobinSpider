    "description": "A solar prominence can take many forms.   Seen against the dark backdrop of space, a high-resolution view reveals incredibly fine detail and structure.\r\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\r\nThis is a hedgerow prominence captured a couple of days ago, April 22, 2019.  The name comes simply from the appearance of a garden hedge.  In this case it looks fairly well manicured, too!\r\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\r\nI added the Earth as a scale reference in the corner so you can see how impressively massive this is.\r\n\r\nRevision C moves the Earth scale next to the prominence to drive the point home.  \r\nüåçüåçüåçüåçüåçüåçüåç",
