    "description": "Shelob lies in wait, anticipating the harmonious twang as her next meal becomes entrapped in her web. You can see the remains of a small scorpion to her left, a previous meal.\r\n\r\nThe Tarantula nebula is a massive HII region within the Large Magellanic Cloud. The weather was briefly good here and the seeing was exceptional. This is 6 hours of SHO data captured from my backyard. Hopefully the weather will clear again so I can continue to capture photons of this beautiful region of space.\r\n\r\nI've added nearly double the data to my original image and decided that while I usually love the SHO palette it wasn't working for Shelob, so I went with a more duo tone look.\r\n\r\nI am hoping to capture much more OIII and SII data in the coming months, the Ha stack looks good now.\r\n\r\nI took only the best frames based on FWHM and used them to create a synthetic luminance, this layer received deconvolution and sharpening.",
