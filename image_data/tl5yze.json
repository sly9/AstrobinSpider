    "description": "Just south of Sadr, in the Gama Cygni Nebula, is IC 1318, the Butterfly Nebula. The body of the butterfly is a dark lane of dust, LDN 889, that bisects the colorful emission nebula that creates the butterfly wings. This image is the northern wing of the butterfly, IC 1318 C, a concentration glowing hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur with of channel dark dust perforating the center of the mass.\r\n\r\nThis image combine data collected over two years with two different OTAâ€™s (both with the same camera, ZWO ASI1600MM Pro). In 2019 I collect 19.6 hours of Ha, OIII, and SII using at SW Esprit 100 (FL 550mm), and in 2020 I collected 12.6 hours of Ha using a WO FLT 132 (FL 925mm). In this rendition I used the 2019 data for color mapping, and used both the 2019 and 2020 Ha data to create a master luminance. The FOV of the 925mm OTA was used for framing (1.2 degrees X 0.8 degrees).\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the original 2019 Butterly Nebula image (IC 1318).\r\n\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/420891/?nc=user",
