    "description": "This is a total reprocessing of the solar capture. Much more detail was obtained by stacking more frames and adding some AI processing to extract more surface detail.\r\n\r\nDescription from The Solar Dynamics Observatory:\r\n\r\nThe biggest solar flare of the year happened yesterday. But don't get excited; it was puny. On April 4th, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured the ultraviolet flash from new-cycle sunspot AR2759:\r\n\r\nThis is a B4-class flare. It caused only a brief and ephemeral wave of ionization to ripple through our planet's upper atmosphere. There were no radio blackouts, GPS disturbances, or satellite outages. Only during Solar Minimum would such a flare receive any attention at all.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, perhaps \"B\" stands for \"Bigger than you think.\" A typical B-class solar flare releases as much energy as 100 million WWII atomic bombs. Only on the sun, which is itself a 1027 ton self-contained nuclear explosion, would such a blast be considered \"puny.\"\r\nSo did something big happen yesterday? Or not? Yes to both.",
