    "description": "A little side project from last session with the 85mm lens and the MiniTrack LX3. The lens was @f4 and from the dual filter I used only Ha. I had to wait till 1AM, until it was high enough, so I had only about 3 hours left. A little bit more Ha would have been nice, but it's OK.ðŸ™‚",
