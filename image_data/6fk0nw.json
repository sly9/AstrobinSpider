Numerous other galaxies occur in this field-of-view. Often they are easily distinguished from the stars by their extended fuzzy halos or oblong shapes. The background galaxies lie at a much greater distance than the triad, which is about 60M light-years away.\r\n\r\nFor the record, there’s a fourth member to this “Quartet”: NGC 7552. It lies about 1/2 deg toward the SW, out of this field-of-view.",
