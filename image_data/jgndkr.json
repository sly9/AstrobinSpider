    "description": "I had to crank up the exposure time on my camera to find these Solar Prominences on the sun's edge.  But when I locked onto them, they were ferocious. \r\n\r\nI stayed on target for one hour and created a time-lapse of it by condensing it down to 3 seconds. I then play it in reverse.\r\n\r\nThis time-lapse consists of 102 frames.",
