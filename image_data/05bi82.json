    "description": "Location:  \"Ground Zero\" - Walmart Parking Lot, Hopkinsville, Kentucky \r\nSeeing: n/a\r\nTransparency: n/a\r\nTemperature: Maybe 95 degrees F\r\nDate: August 21, 2017\r\n\r\nScope/Mount: 3\" Takahashi FSQ-85ED apo refractor\r\nCamera: Nikon D810a DSLR\r\nMount: Takahashi NJP Temma 2\r\nFilters: none\r\nGuider: none\r\nExposure Info: This is a composite image, with nine individual sub exposures ranging from 1/3200 seconds to 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nSubject Notes:  I was treated to the most glorious visual experience EVER with this 2017 Total Solar Eclipse.  My journey took me Hopkinsville, KY, which was essentially \"ground-zero\" for the eclipse. We were blessed with clear skies and friendly, excited neighbors for the 2 minutes and 40 seconds of totality. \r\n\r\nThis is the full solar corona, which is visible during totality. This image is a composite of several images ranging from 1/3200 seconds to 2 seconds. These are put together in Photoshop by uniting the images as a Smart Object and applying \"mean\" blending to the stack.\r\n\r\nThe moon details, which aren't visible with the eye during a total eclipse, become visible in a longer exposure due to reflected earth light (earthshine) that illuminates the moon's surface. The wispy details of the jets of particles that stream through the sun's coronosphere - collectively called the \"corona\" - are details achieved with additional processing.  A tip for PixInsight users: use the Larson-Sekanina process on the stacked image.\r\n\r\nEquipment used for this image was a Tak FSQ-85 (without solar filter) and Nikon D810A on a Tak NJP mount.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to my friend Ross Lawrence for sharing the journey with me...and especially my wife, Helen, and kids for pardoning my absence from home.",
