    "description": "Another faint object,  fortunately it is not as faint as HFG1.  From official description:\r\n\"Sh2 -224 is a supernova remnant visible in the northern constellation of Auriga .\r\n\r\n3.5 Â° a SSE of the bright star Capella , the dominant star of the constellation, is identified ; it is formed by two tenuous nebulous filaments, the most conspicuous of which is the northwest one and extends for 20 'x 30' towards the center of the radio wave source , which has dimensions of 70 'x 75'. [4] Being at a moderately northern declination , its observation is easy especially in the regions of the northern hemisphere , where it is visible high in the sky for most nights of the year.\r\n\r\nThe object has an unusual shape, with a shell structure with a radius equal to about 25 parsecs , and is in interaction with a cavity of the interstellar medium at a higher temperature than the surrounding environment, located in the southwestern part and shaped like a bow; this conformation suggests that the southwestern supernova remnant made contact with the cavity, first deforming and interacting with this structure, then expanding within it and creating a larger propagation wave that emerged from the side opposite, thus creating the arched structure visible in the westernmost part, ie beyond the cavity. [5] [6] The distance to the structure is estimated at 14700light years from the solar system , [2] in a peripheral region of the Arm of Perseus . An age of the structure between 13,000 and 24,000 years was determined through the X-ray study . \"\r\n\r\nI kept looking at it, it was  like a fisherman with a hat, pretty typical in asia countries. \r\n\r\n\r\nNights:\r\n12/8/2020,12/9/2020, 12/11/2020, 12/14/2020, 12/16/2020, 12/18/2020\r\n\r\n\r\nSubs:\r\nHA: 26x1800s\r\nO3: 42x1800s\r\nR/G/B: 30x120s each",
