    "description": "Carina nebula is one of the most famous object of the southern hemisphere. Of course, it also topped my sighting list in 2018 when I was in Namibia. Because the area was densely covered with stars and because it consisted largely of emission nebulae, I decided to use a UHC filter. This allows only the most typical emission radiation (Hydrogen alpha and beta, OIII) to pass through and also reduces the apparent size of the stars, making the subject more visible.",
