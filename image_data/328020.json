    "description": "The Jellyfish Nebula is the remnant of a supernova interacting with local interstellar molecular clouds located at a distance of about 5,000 ly.  The entire nebula is quite a large complex that extends over roughly one degree.  At one edge, lies a neutron star that was formed after the supernova event.  The interaction of the rapidly expanding gas shell with the surrounding dust clouds created the complex web of turbulent material visible in this image.  Energy produced by the deceleration of the leading edge of the blast wave is the source of  maser radiation that has been detected from this object.  The prominent dark lane passing through the lower/right  portion of the image is likely due to a molecular cloud in front of the nebula along our line of sight.\r\n\r\nThe narrow band  data for this image was captured over the period of about a month using my remotely operated C14 Edge located at DSW outside of Santa Fe.   This image is presented in the Hubble SHO palette and is made up of a subset of 20 minute exposures  selected from a total of 87 hours of exposure.   Given the large amount of data, I was able to pull out a fair amount of detail in the dust clouds and it is interesting to examine it in detail on a full screen.\r\n\r\nI often miss one thing or another in my processing so as always, C&C is more than welcome.  Maybe someday I'll finally get this thing figured out...   :-))\r\n\r\nJohn",
