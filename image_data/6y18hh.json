    "description": "This is a 90 panel mosaic of a section of the Milky Way. It's just a portion of what I'm working on a the moment but as this section is pretty much finished I thought I'd share what I've got here so far. Although every individual panel is astrometrically correct I'm still trying to figure out how to combine all of them together in AutoPano Giga without introducing curvature within the field. I've used the Hammer projection method for this as it produces the most accurate but even then it is changing astrometric positions so I need to figure out how to do this.\r\n\r\nAs I'm only uploading a small version on here, below is a link to a 500 megapixel version of it on Gigapan. At full resolution this is about 9.5 gigapixels in size so it's been quite heavily reduced from it's native size.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gigapan.com/gigapans/217618\r\n\r\nEnjoy looking around the field :)",
