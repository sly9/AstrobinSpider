    "description": "M109 is 83 million light years away.  It is rather a faint galaxy that what I expected.  Working with longer focal length and capturing this galaxy is very challenging.  Please feel free to comment on how I captured and processed this Galaxy.  Also I put a video on many other details if you are interested.",
