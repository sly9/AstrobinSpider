    "description": "Finally I have managed to put together al the elements for this object. Capturing data was, in this case, the easy part. Along some nights in May and June I managed to get a lot of hours (I think it is my longest integration).  All of them were captured from my backyard at the outskirts of Madrid (Bortle class 6 area), narrowband is kind of magic I must admit. \r\n\r\nBut processing has been a tedious journey, I wanted to squeeze all the juice of all that data, so I have taken many attempts, going all the way to the last part only to find something that I was not happy with or that wasnt up to the quality of the data.  It is funny how sentitive is processing to initial conditions (as if it were a nonlinear or chaotic process)... starting all over to solve something was leading me to different results with new aspects to solve.... interesting journey....\r\n\r\nEventually I have managed to come up with this result, of which I am specially happy about  the details in the dark nebula and dust \"winds\", the dynamic range in the dark areas and of course to check that even though I was using the Esprit 100 I managed to capture with some detail the HH-555 and other HH objects (only visible in the enlarged view).\r\n\r\n(EDIT) I forgot to include that color is a variation of SHO with these config:\r\n\r\nR=0.9*SII+0.3*Ha\r\nG=H+0.6OIII\r\nB=OIII+0.3Ha\r\n\r\nI ended up on this config adter serveral tries to: 1) not to let bloated SII stars rule the starfield, and 2) achieve a \"natural color\" on the stars. \r\n\r\nHope you like it and any comment is welcomed!\r\n\r\nGuillermo",
