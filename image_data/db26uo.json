    "description": "An interesting, dusty and rather bright star forming region within the Taurus molecular cloud.  Sh2-239 is surrounded and within the dark nebula LDN 1551.  This area is thought to have 50 times the mass of the sun.  Also within Sh2-239 are several Herbig-Haro objects, typical of protostars.  The nebula glows from the light of many dozen protostars  within the cloud complex.  Interesting jets of hydrogen can also be seen within the nebula.  The image was taken in Jan and early Feb 2021 and contains 18.8hrs of data through LRGB and Ha filters.",
