    "description": "NGC 3628, also known as the Hamburger Galaxy or Sarah's Galaxy, is an unbarred spiral galaxy about 35 million light-years away in the Leo constellation. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. It has an approximate 300,000 light-years long tidal tail. Along with M65 and M66, NGC 3628 forms the Leo Triplet, a small group of galaxies. Its most conspicuous feature is the broad and obscuring band of dust on the outer edge of its spiral arms, effectively transecting the galaxy to the Earth view.",
