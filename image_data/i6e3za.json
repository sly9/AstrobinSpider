    "description": "This rather bright spiral is located in Coma Berenice, north of the Needle and south of the Whale.\r\nIts distance is given with 35*10E6 lightyears, the bulge and bar are not pronounced in this SBcd type, but there is a lot of detail like HII regions and blue star knots in the arms resolved. The field harbours many distant galaxies and galaxy clusters. A rewarding target deserves more attention among its neighbours IMHO.\r\n\r\nLRGB with Lacerta 10\" f/4 and ASI1600MMP at gain Zero, with Astronomik Deepsky RGB filters. AZ-EQ6 guided by Mgen-3.",
