    "description": "This is the first time I tried with capturing Heart Nebula in narrowband last year. I was shocked by the natural heart shape that it forms naturally. I hope you guys like it! 25 hours of acquisition. I also have other work that you like on other platforms, for portraits, landscape, astrophotography, macro, and product. Hope you enjoy!\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/chriskingpro/\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/chrisking_portrait/",
