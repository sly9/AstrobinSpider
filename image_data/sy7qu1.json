    "description": "Ok...these galaxies belong to a trio and are not only a pair. My chip size would match all the three on one pic but it looked like pressed into a frame, so I decided for these two only. Basing on the color data I already had from my CT 10, I added some new luminance from my edge for this rework. Only 200 x50 sec of UV/IR subs.The rest is from last year. NGC3628 deserves an own image under darker skies than I have here in my backyard. Hope you like it...\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
