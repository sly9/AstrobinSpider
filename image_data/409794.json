    "description": "NGC 6888 is an accumulation of ionized gas in the constellation Cygnus that is driven away by the stellar wind of a hot Wolf-Rayet type star (WR136). The ionized gas emits red light in the hydrogen alpha wavelength (red). The central hydrogen alpha gas compex is wrapped by a wavefront of gas that contains oxygen molecules which emit green-blue light.\r\n\r\nThe image was composed from picture taken with two cameras\r\n\r\nASI1600mmp:\r\nHa  38 x 300s @ gain 139\r\nOIII 58 x 300s @ gain 139\r\n\r\nASI294mcp:\r\n100 x 15s @ gain 125 (for the stars)\r\n\r\nTelescope: 130/910 mm TS Photoline APO Triplet\r\n\r\nPP: Channele combination in APP and PSCC2019",
