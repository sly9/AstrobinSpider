    "description": "SHO pallet image of NGC 7822 in Cepheus.  I originally posted a LHaOIIIRGB composite image of this object back a few weeks ago.  The data for this image was taken during the same trip to the Okie Tex Star Party but is a SHO composite.  Its quite striking what one can see utilizing a broadband RGB type composite compared to a SHO composite.",
