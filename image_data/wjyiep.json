    "description": "The Cygnus Wall is part of the more popular North America Nebula (NGC 7000) and is a massive star forming region approximately 20 light-years long.  The whole North America Nebula complex is about  1,500 light-years away in Cygnus an sits in the Milky Way plane.  I have imaged NGC 7000 a few times in the past but not with my AT115 refractor.  The whole region is very large so I decided to focus in on The Cygnus Wall portion.  I feel I am late to this party as most people have moved on but my FOV is always later.  I was done with this three weeks ago but I am extremely busy and have no time to process although I have been imaging as I have two more object in the Que. \r\n\r\nI am really  glad I did in SHO as I was going back and forth with HOO but went with the SHO anyway.  I was not going to use StarNet++ as the stars seemed small and nice to start but I began to process and they become a nuisance so I used it after all  - I was using it in PI but since I did the new PI upgrade it does not work so I do it in Windows.  There was a lot of faint nebulosity around the outside edges which was good and bad so the hard part for me was deciding on what to show and what not to show.  So I decided to use the histogram, I lowered the offset so the histogram went halfway between where I thought it was done and where it would start clipping signal. \r\n\r\nI am happy with how it turned out especially the yellow-gold detail of the Wall itself.  Also, in trying to be different, I decided to keep it flipped so Florida is on the bottom sticking up into the Gulf of Mexico. \r\n\r\nhttps://kurtzeppetello.smugmug.com/\r\nhttp://astroquest1.blogspot.com/\r\nhttp://youtube.com/c/AstroQuest1",
