    "description": "First light (for me!) of a 40 year old, $60 lens from Ebay with narrowband imaging. Without any autofocus, I imaged one filter per night and didn't touch the focus once it started. Unfortunately due to clouds I lost about 2 hours on my OIII images but I think I still had sufficient data.  \r\nThis was imaged at F/4 but I should have probably used F/5.6 to get better stars\r\n\r\nThis old lens seems to be excellent for narrowband imaging on a tight budget but may not be very good for LRGB imaging but i'll certainly give it a try sometime. \r\n\r\nI went with a slightly different color composition than the standard Red/Blue combination.",
