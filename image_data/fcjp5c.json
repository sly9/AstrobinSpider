    "description": "This is part of the region surrounding the star cluster RCW 38, located about 5,500 light years away towards Vela. RCW 38 is an \"embedded\" cluster, in that the clouds of dust still envelop the newly formed stars. The area is an extremely active star forming region and presents a very dramatic vista.\n\nImaged in SHO narrowband at El Sauce, Obstech, Chile\nImage Processing: Roberto Colombari and Mike Selby\nSystem Control Software: Voyager by Leo Orazi",
