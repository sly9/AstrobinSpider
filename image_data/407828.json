    "description": "NGC 5236 is a beautiful barred spiral galaxy located just 15 million light-years away.  It occupies an area of 12.9 X 11.5 arcmin of the sky.  To give this value some perspective, the diameter of the full moon is 31 arcmin or ½ degree in diameter.  When I first started processing the data for this galaxy, it struck me just how fortunate I was in locating a suitable guide star.  At times I can’t image an object as there are no suitable guide stars in the field.  When target selections are out of the galactic plane, locating an appropriate guide star can become an issue with the narrow field of view present in the Off-Axis Guider (OAG), around 5.5 arcmins.  Its presentation and orientation of M83 really couldn’t get any better.  I can look and explore the details for long extended periods.  It has well-defined arms containing very active and bright Ha within these areas.  Tiny wispy threads are visible at the ends of the galaxy arms.  If you look carefully, dark vanes present within the dimmest parts.  And, to top it off, the many tiny galaxies distributed throughout really complete the scene.   Yep, it’s been on my todo list for years, and hopefully, I have done it justice.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Pinwheel Galaxy has a Magnitude of 7.54, making it one of the brightest barred spiral galaxies our the sky.  This is a massive grand design spiral and is about one half the size of our galaxy, The Milky Way.  Grand design spiral is an appropriate name for this classification.\r\n\r\nIt seems that every galaxy I process is very different.  I love the symmetry of this object, and how the large amount of Ha areas along the arms add a level of dimension to the image.  Images from the high-resolution Hubble telescope reveal interstellar bubbles produced by nearly 300 supernovae.  Six recent supernova explosions recorded in The Southern Pinwheel Galaxy include SN 1923A, SN 1945B, SN 1950B, SN 1957D, SN 1968L, and SN 1983N.  \r\n\r\nInstruments Used:\r\n•\t10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\n•\tAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\n•\tSBIG STL 11000m\r\n•\tFLI Filter Wheel\r\n•\tAstrodon Luminance, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\n•\tBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nAcquisition Details\r\n•\tLuminance  35 X 900 seconds\r\n•\tHa  36 X 1200 seconds\r\n•\tBlue   12 X 900 seconds\r\n•\tGreen  8 X 900 seconds\r\n•\tRed  7 X 900 seconds\r\n\r\nTotal Time: 27.5 Hours",
