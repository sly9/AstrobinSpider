    "description": "The galaxies NGC5566, NGC5569, and NGC5560 form a triplet known as Arp286. This triplet is an extension of the Virgo cluster. The redshift of the 2 smaller galaxies are almost identical , thus very probably at the same distance of 78 millions light years. \r\n\r\nRed 20subs@180s -20째C gain zero\r\nBlue 20subs@180s -20째C gain zero\r\nGreen 20subs@180s -20째C gain zero\r\nLight subs@180s -20째C, gain zero\r\n\r\n4 nights were necessary to get the subs: 25/26 , 26/27, 31/01, and 02 of June\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate too look at the full field :-)",
