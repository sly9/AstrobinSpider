    "description": "After acquiring my Mach 1 in September, the ubiquitous \"new-gear-induced-cloud-cover\" seemed to stretch an entire winter for me. So here I am many months later, finally getting a first light with it.  To nobody's surprise, it performed beautifully. The Elephant Trunk is an awesome structure that I had previously attempted with an unmodified DSLR, and after taking a single frame and seeing how little signal I was getting, gave up on immediately. In narrowband, this object has some really amazing detail, and is very well suited to careful and incremental deconvolution and multi-scale processing in PixInsight to make it crisp and bold. It also rewards composition, and I'm very pleased with the framing of the object. Thanks for looking!",
