    "description": "The Iris Nebula of the constellation Cepheus is a bright reflection nebula that is lit by a magnitude +7 star, SAO 19158. It is a massive, hot, young star in its formative years. The Iris Nebula lies 1,300 light-years away and is six light-years across. Within the Iris Nebula, the color is bule because of reflecting starlight by dust grains. And some filaments of the central nubula glow with a reddish photoluminesence as some dust grains convert the star's invisible ultraviolet radiation to visible red light.",
