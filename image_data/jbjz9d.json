    "description": "Located about 12,000 light-year away in the northern constellation, Auriga, the Tadpole Nebula is a dusty emission nebula and an active star-forming region. The cloud of glowing gas is more than 100 light-years across, sculpted by stellar winds and radiation from an embedded open star cluster, NGC 1893. The name-sake feature of the nebula are two dense streamers of gas and dust that resemble wriggling tadpoles. Potential star forming sites, the “tadpoles” are about 10 light-years long, with tapered tails extending toward the edge of the nebula.\r\n\r\nI’ve been attempting to shoot this object for a few years. Each fall, when the tadpoles rose into view, weather or wildfires obscured the night sky and the project was pushed to “next year.” In 2020 I got lucky, had two perfect nights in a row in November with good seeing, and was able to collect just enough excellent data to give this image a go. This is an SHO rendition using standard Hubble color assignment. I relied on Ha subs with an HFR of <2.2 for a luminance mask, incorporating multiple rounds of Pixinsight Multi Scale Median Transfer and Deconvolution to reduce noise and enhance structural detail. I particularly favor the “backlit” appearance of the tadpoles in the blue-green pond of glowing oxygen gas. This feature is reminiscent of one of my favorite objects, Melotte 15, with the dusty “islands” suspended in the a sea of glowing oxygen.",
