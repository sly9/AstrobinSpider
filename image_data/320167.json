    "description": "To improve colors and details, I have used an hybrid color palette composed by narrowband, red, green and blue data that shows \r\ntogether primary and complementary colors along a continuum. \r\n\r\nTo make this image, I have mixed up data coming from my new and my old setups\r\n\r\nMy new setup is a Takahashi FSQ106 equiped with a Optec Gemini Focuser-Rotator and an Andore Apogee Alta F16M (KAF-16803 monochrome)\r\nMy old setup is a Takahashi FSQ106ED with original focuser and captain wheel and a Apogee Alta U8300 (KAF-8300 monochrome)\r\n\r\nData captured 10/15/2017, 10/16/2017, 10/25/2017, and 10/206/2017 with my new setup:\r\n16 x 1200 H-a unbinned = 5h20\r\n22 x 300s Red unbinned = 1h50\r\n22 x 300s Green unbinned = 1h50\r\n26 x 300s Blue unbinned = 2h10\r\n\r\nData captured 09/21/2013, 09/22/2013, 09/23/2013, 09/24/2013, 10/31/2013, and 11/06/2013 with my old setup (8 pannels mosaic):\r\n40 x 1200s H-a unbinned = 13h20\r\n34 x 1200s OIII unbinned = 11h20\r\n35 x 1200s SII unbinned = 11h40\r\n\r\nTotal exposure 47h30\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nInstruments: Takahashi FSQ106ED @f/5 530mm focal length with ONAG XT (http://www.innovationsforesight.com/), Optec Gemini Focuser-Rotator, Apogee Alta F16M + 7 positions filter wheel @-25°C and Apogee Alta U8300 monochrome @-30°C and Astrodon narrowband H-alpha, OIII and SII 5nm filters and Astrodon broadband RGB filters on 10micron GM2000 HPS II\r\nSoftwares: SkySurveyor for MaximDL as orchestrator - MaximDL for guiding and capture - SharpLock to keep the optical train perfectly focused - CCDStack to calibrate, register, normalize, data reject and combine - Registar and PixInsight for mosaic assembly - Photoshop CC and PixInsight for LRGB composition and multiscale non-linear streching - Photoshop and APF-R for sharpening http://www.cedic.at/apfr/. APF-R does not do only sharpening it allows to reveal hidden structure that are embedded in the signal.",
