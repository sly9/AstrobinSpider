    "description": "The night this data was collected had pretty good transparency and reasonable seeing, but I was a bit concerned about the data quality nonetheless ... for some reason, I always struggle with the stability of my CEM60 when the OTA is on the east side of the mount. My imaging targets bounce around a lot, almost like the mount is being affected by wind (but with no wind or breeze to speak of). Maybe I need to adjust the counterweights/balance for this circumstance? Any tips/ideas on this one appreciated!\r\n\r\nIn the end I had 18 x 90s captures with decent data to stack and de-rotate - total time elapsed between the first and last capture is almost exactly 30mins. Between the vibration in the mount and the seeing I had to be pretty brutal with the frame quality selection, stacking the top 15% in each case. Thus the final images contain just shy of 20,000 frames of data.\r\n\r\nI went back-and-forth with the processing on this one, initially producing an image that looked nice and crisp - sharpening taken just far enough to remove the blur, but possibly over-sharpened for some tastes (<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/410991/B/\">Rev B</a>). \r\n\r\nBut I then decided that \"some tastes\" included my own, so I made a version with the sharpening backed off a little (<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/410991/0/\">Rev A</a>).\r\n\r\nArguably a quite subtle difference, but let me know which you prefer.  :)\r\n\r\nFinally, I have produced an animation by de-rotating a moving average of 6 captures/stacks (<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/410991/C/\">Rev C</a>).\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
