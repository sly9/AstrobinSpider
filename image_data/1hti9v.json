    "description": "* Image Acquisition by Wei-Hao Wang\r\n* Image Processing by Frank Breslawski\r\n\r\nFor almost three months there was no starry night over my observatory. All the more I was pleased that Wei-Hao Wang released his data for further use by all astrophotographers. A great gift to the community - thanks for that! :-)\r\n\r\nI found some data sets of objects that I will unfortunately never be able to photograph from my location in the northern hemisphere. And my equipment will probably never make the trip to the southern hemisphere either....\r\n\r\nOmega Centauri is the largest globular cluster in our galaxy and has an unusually dense core. The stars in the core of Omega Centauri are so crowded that they are estimated to average only 0.1 light years away from each other. In the image processing I tried to show exactly this. The core should appear bright and just resolved. But see for yourselves - hope you like it! :-)",
