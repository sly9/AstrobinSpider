Still - if Fate is with me...why not?\r\n\r\nAnyways. NGC 918 is located in Aries, around 70 mln ly away and it is quite dim - with its apparent magnitude of 15. It has an active nucleus and seems to be very active in producing new stars  Most spectacular about the galaxy is its relation to the other object in the sky - meaning mainly the very fain Integrated Flux Nebula around it, making this object hard  to shoot and very attractive at a time.\r\n\r\nAbout post processing - I added all my R G B stacks to my L stack, having in result an artificial Superluminance of 24 hours.\r\n\r\nDid what i  could...",
