    "description": "The Helix Nebula, also known as NGC 7293, is a large planetary nebula located in the constellation Aquarius. This object is one of the closest to the Earth of all the bright planetary nebulae. The estimated distance is about 700 light years and spanning 2.5 light years.\r\nThe Helix Nebula is formed by an intermediate to low-mass star, which sheds its outer layers near the end of its evolution. The remnant central stellar core, known as a planetary nebula nucleus, is destined to become a white dwarf star. Currently, the age is estimated to be 10,600 years.",
