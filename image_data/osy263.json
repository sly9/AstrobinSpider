    "description": "Trying to fight neighbor light and clouds with a wonderful galaxy pair. At this point 8.5 hours RGB and 13 hours L with 120s subframes.  Also 23 hours of Ha in 600s subframes just for the sake of M82's jets and mild push on M81 nebula in arms.  This ist an experiment for workflow adding in the Ha.  L was deconvoluted before making RGBL and then just the M82 jets and m81 arm knots added into red channel.  Mild HDMI and then curves for saturation. Finished with tgvdenoise with default L denoise decreased and RGB increased with a luminance mask on the galaxies. Black point with curves.",
