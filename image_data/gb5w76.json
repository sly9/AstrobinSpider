    "description": "I managed to get chance to process some more data from Pier 4 from Spain, and I am impressed with the quality of these subs I am receiving. I used 175 subs at 60s each, which means an integration time of only 2 hours and 55 minutes - and it is a OSC! It made my PC earn its money, due to the size of the files!\r\n\r\nPier 4 is a ZWO ASI-2066MC Pro OSC with a Sigma 105mm f/1.4 lens stopped to F/2, Astromechanics focuser, guided with a ZWO ASI-120 Mini and ZWO Mini guide scope, Astro Physics AP900 GTo3 mount. The mount actually runs unguided, so the guide scope is in there as a backup.\r\n\r\nThanks...\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks everyone and have a good night...\r\n\r\n\r\nSimon",
