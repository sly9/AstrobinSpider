    "description": "A slight issue with framing for a few of the frames. The subs were taken over a long period of time and some were taken after the team had just set up all equipment. In any case I love the colors in this image and did not want to miss the bright yellow star at the bottom of the image, which is why I left the image as is without cropping it. It does feel like it is a mosaic, but it really is not.\r\n\r\nData capture credit: John Kasianowicz, Josh Balsam, Justin Lian, Scott Johnson., Michael Bushell., Mike Selby., Rich Johnson. and Dhaval Brahmbhatt.\r\n\r\nImage Processing: Dhaval Brahmbhatt",
