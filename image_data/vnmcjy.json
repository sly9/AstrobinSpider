    "description": "The Cygnus Wall as a part of the North America Nebula (NGC 7000 or Caldwell 20) in the constellation Cygnus. It is located approximately 2,500 light years from Earth and covers a region more than ten times the area of the full moon. This deep space object is an emission nebula consisting mostly of ionized hydrogen as well as dark regions of dense interstellar dust.\r\n\r\nBy far one of my favorite targets so far.",
