    "description": "I had exceptional seeing for this capture of Jupiter. I have rendered a rather close up view, to show the beautiful detail of the Jovian giant. The tilt is purely for aesthetic reasons.\r\nThe Great Red Spot (GRS) and Oval BA are close to the limb at right and provide a nice counterpoint to the beautiful multi-coloured bands that encircle the planet. \r\nThere are 3 white ovals in the STZ....the string of pearls. These are designated A3, A2 & A1 from left to right. The large oval to the North, in the NNTB is designated NN-WS-4. You may be surprised that many of these features are named and tracked by scientists who study Jupiter's atmosphere.\r\nHowever, beyond the science, the artistry of the bands, with their swirls and festoons and the complimentary colours with reds, maroons, browns, golds and whites, is profoundly appealing.",
