    "description": "* Image acquisition by: Las Cumbres Observatory.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* Distance: 46 Mly.\r\n\r\nThis is just a 9 minute exposure photograph and shows a rare object.\r\n\r\nMessier 108 is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. From the perspective of the Earth, this galaxy is seen almost edge-on.\r\n\r\nM108 is an isolated member of the Ursa Major Cluster of galaxies in the Virgo supercluster. It is a barred spiral galaxy with somewhat loosely wound arms. \r\n\r\nThis galaxy has an estimated mass of 125 billion times the mass of the Sun and includes about 290 Â± 80 globular clusters. Examination of the distribution of neutral hydrogen in this galaxy shows shells of expanding gas extending for several kiloparsecs, known as H1 supershells. These may be driven by bursts of star formation activity, resulting in supernovae explosions. Alternatively they may result from an infall of gas from outside the galaxy or by radio jets. The supermassive black hole at the core has an estimated mass equal to 24 million times the mass of the Sun.",
