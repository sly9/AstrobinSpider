    "description": "Images from the following two scopes (piggybacked) contributed to this image:\r\nAG12+ASI1600MM at .70 asec/pix\r\nTV127is+ASI183MM at .75 asec/pix. \r\nThey were all registered to the best Ha image taken on the AG12.\r\nUsing L (synthetic from RGB) from the TV NP127is refractor effectively eliminates the spikes from the AG12.\r\n\r\nImaged on nights of 11/15/2018, 11/18/2018, 11/19/2018, 12/4/2018.\r\n\r\nThis is by far the faintest planetary nebula I have ever imaged.  Looking at a single frame there is virtually no hint that this PN exists.  There are very few amateur examples.  Chris Sullivan introduced it to me with his fine example https://www.astrobin.com/373346/B/?nc=all for which he received an IOTD.\r\n\r\nThe following description comes from the excellent example by Mark Hanson at  https://www.hansonastronomy.com/ferrero-6-fe-6-pn-g1296034/ which was taken with a Planewave 24\" f6.7 on a Planewave HD Mount, Camera: SBIG 16803.\r\n\r\nExplanation From Sakib Rasool\r\nIPHASX J015624.9+652830 is a planetary nebula that was discovered as part of the IPHAS survey. It was spectroscopically confirmed as a true planetary nebula by the professional astronomer Laurence Sabin in September 2011. It has also been independently discovered by the French amateur astronomer Laurent Ferrero in 2013 and is also known as Fe 6. Its structure consists of a low surface brightness bubble with a size of 3.5 arcminutes, which is accentuated by a thin \"bright\" rim on the outside. It is very likely to be an ancient evolved planetary nebula that is interacting with the interstellar medium (ISM) and its intensely blue central star is easily visible near the centre. Despite its faintness, it is possible to visually observe it in very large telescopes.",
