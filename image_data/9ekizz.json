    "description": "NGC 253 (The Sculptor Galaxy) is the brightest member of the Sculptor group of galaxies, which is grouped around the South galactic pole. The many bright clusters scattered across the galaxy are stellar nurseries where hot young stars have just lit up. The radiation emanating from these giant blue-white “babies” makes the surrounding clouds of ionized hydrogen glow vividly. I was very pleased to end up with an image that reveal great details of this wonderful starburst galaxy.\r\n\r\nLRHaGB composition with some help from the Oiii layer for the blue",
