    "description": "I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy while we sit here and battle a microscopic enemy.  Hereâ€™s a look way out into the telescopic world, far from our Earthly problems.\r\n\r\nThese two beautiful spiral galaxies sit very high in the northern sky, within 10 degrees of Polaris.  They are rarely imaged but make a beautiful photographic pairing.\r\n\r\nThe largest of these two is NGC2336 is 100 million light years away.  This is a very unique-looking barred spiral with, 7 or 8 distinct spiral arms.  Its outer reaches shimmer with the vibrant blue of young stars.\r\n\r\nThe smaller, IC467, shows a less defined structure.  It is only slightly farther away than NGC2336 (~10mly), so is truly a diminutive galaxy.\r\n\r\nI shot these back in the October / November timeframe....still playing catch-up.",
