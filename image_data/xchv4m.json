    "description": "Sh2-224 is a supernova remnant  SNR G166.0+04.3 (2014); it is more popularly known as Sh2-224 or LBN 769. The Sharpless and Lynds designations are really the HII regions within the remnant. This supernova remnant is also designated as a BLAZER in the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) 2FGL data series (2FGL J0526.6+4308) - indicating it as a high energy particle ejection source.   There are several background galaxies visible in this image as well; only one has a distance estimate (LEDA 97090 - 513 million light years).\r\n\r\nMy Collections:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2627/\" target=\"_new\">Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2626/\" target=\"_new\">Galaxies</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2625/\" target=\"_new\">Sharpless 2 Objects</a>",
