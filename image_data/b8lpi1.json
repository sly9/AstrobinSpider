    "description": "NGC5866 is about 50 million light-years away.  It is classified as a lenticular galaxy, although its actual shape remains uncertain.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:\r\n\"Dust laneâ€‹\r\n\r\nOne of the most outstanding features of NGC 5866 is the extended dust disk, which is seen almost exactly edge-on.[6] This dust lane is highly unusual for a lenticular galaxy. The dust in most lenticular galaxies is generally found only near the nucleus and generally follows the light profile of the galaxies' bulges.[7][8] This dust disk may contain a ring-like structure, although the shape of this structure is difficult to determine given the edge-on orientation of the galaxy.[8] It is also possible that the galaxy is a spiral galaxy that was misclassified as a lenticular galaxy because of its edge-on orientation, in which case the dust lane would not be too unusual.[7] \r\n\r\nGalaxy group information\r\n\r\nNGC 5866 is one of the brightest galaxies in the NGC 5866 Group, a small galaxy group that also includes the spiral galaxies NGC 5879 and NGC 5907.[9][10][11] This group may actually be a subclump at the northwest end of a large, elongated structure that comprises the M51 Group and the M101 Group, although most sources distinguish the three groups as separate entities.[12]\"\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the image!",
