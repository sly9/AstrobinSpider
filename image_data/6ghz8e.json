    "description": "NGC 7027 is a very small and atypical planetary nebula in Cygnus. It has a very complex shape, consisting of an elliptical region of ionized gas within a massive neutral cloud.\r\n\r\nMy picture is taken with the Newton 350 using an ASI 224 MC camera in 2016 and an ASI 290 MMC camera with CLS filter during 2019 summer. I used a Barlow to get 2800 mm focal length. The image is drizzled and enlarged. The HST image is reduced about 10x to make the comparisson.\r\n\r\nIt has a very high surface brightness allowing 350 ms exposures.\r\n\r\nJF",
