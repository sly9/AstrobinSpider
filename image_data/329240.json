    "description": "Simeis 147, also known as the Spaghetti Nebula, SNR G180.0-01.7 or Sharpless 2-240, is a supernova remnant in the Milky Way, straddling the border between the constellations Auriga and Taurus.\r\n\r\nThe nebulous area is fairly large with an almost spherical shell and filamentary structure. The remnant has an apparent diameter of approximately 3 degrees, an estimated distance of approximately 3000 (Â±350) light-years, and an age of approximately 40,000 years.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that after its stellar explosion a rapidly spinning neutron star known as pulsar PSR J0538+2817 was left behind in the nebula core, emitting a strong radio signal.\r\nInfo from: <a HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeis_147\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeis_147</a> \r\n\r\nThis image is a small section of the nebula, in fact it is panel 10 of a 16 panel mosaic that I started recently. Due to the rather long integration times for each panel, this mosaic will be considered a very long term project!\r\n\r\nNarrow band images processed as tone maps with RGB stars added after. Most of the processing is done in PixInsight and finished off in Photoshop.",
