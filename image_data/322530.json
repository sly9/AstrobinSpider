    "description": "This object is a fantastic mix of glowing interstellar gas, dark dust clouds, and brilliant stars located 7500 light years away in the Cassiopeia constellation.  In the center of the image are the massive hot stars of a newborn star cluster known as Melotte 15. The stellar winds and radiation of these stars are sculpting the surrounding dust clouds into fantastic shapes.  Other minor star clusters are sprinkled throughout the image, such as Markarian 6, the line of 7 bright stars at lower left.  At lower right is the Fishhead Nebula (IC1795), which has interestingly shaped dust lanes cutting through the nebula.  \r\n\r\nThe narrowband colors of this image are due to the presence of sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen gases in the nebula, assigned to the red, green and blue channels respectively.",
