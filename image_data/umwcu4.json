    "description": "This was shot when Mars barely cleared my treeline around 2:30 AM (about 15 degrees). The seeing was pretty bad. I got few videos before turning off. I really should shoot these early in the morning next time around. \r\n\r\nDue to the seeing, I could only stack 5%. But Due to high framerate (174 FPS), I had 31k frame in 3 minutes).. This is derotating 3 videos and sharpened in Registax.",
