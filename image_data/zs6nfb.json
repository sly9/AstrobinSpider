    "description": "Shot the comet again early July 11, 2020. This time used a different camera with RGB filters instead of one shot colour. The comet seems to have changed in 3 days, showing much more green colour in the inner coma. This image is about 12 arc minutes in height. 3 minutes total RGB data.",
