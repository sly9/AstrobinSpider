    "description": "This is NGC6164 emission nebular in the constellation of Norma, captured from the Michael Jones Observatory in September 2019.  The nebular has formed from the intense radiation of the central O Type star. The nebula is enveloped by a delicate blue shroud that is thought to have formed from an earlier active phase of the O star.\r\n\r\nThis image is a product combining hydrogen-alpha filtered images with Oxygen III filtered images to produce a bi-colour image.\r\n\r\nSystem details\r\nTelescope: AG Optical Systems 0.3 meter iDK,\r\nFocal length 2121 mm\r\nCamera: mono FLI ML16200 with a Loadstar X2 on an Astrodon MOAG off-axis guider.\r\nAdaptive Optics: SXV-AO-LF\r\nObservatory: Scopedome 3m\r\nAcquisition software: Voyager\r\nPlate size: 44' x 35'\r\nHydrgen-alpha filter 25 x 20 minutes\r\nOyxgen III filter 66 x 20 minutes",
