    "description": "M63, Data acquired during 3 nights, using an OSC. During post processing, I have extracted LRGB channels and processed using a mono camera workflow. L channel was processed separately for deconvolution, sharpening and noise reduction. RGB re-composed image was colour calibrated and was masked stretched to maintain colour information. I hope you like the result of a 6\" refractor and a very competent OSC from a bortle6/7 urban sky :-)",
