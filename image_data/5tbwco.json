    "description": "I have spent a few hours enjoying the processing of this magnificent image obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope, I am fascinated by the appearance of the clouds of gas and dust that are seen in the image, since I began to process it I cannot remove from my head the impression that I am observing the surface of Mars. I encourage you to spend a little time enjoying the magnificent Hubble data.\r\n\r\nIn February 2018 the STScI Outreach Imaging Team obtained a large mosaic image, with 4 pointings in a 2x2 pattern, of the Lagoon Nebula (Messier 8) with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The resulting color composite images were released in April 2018 to celebrate Hubble's 28th anniversary.",
