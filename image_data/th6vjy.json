It is the second largest star-forming region in the LMG, and appears to have a complex history. NGC 1761 (the star cluster in the hollowed center of the nebula appears to have form a large bubble in the gases and in that bubble other centers of star formation have arisen. Those subsequent star-births are evacuating their own bubble and sculpting loops of gas and dust. Rosado et al. (1996) have coined the turm “ring of HII regions” for this geometry of clouds and star-forming centers. Even Further out, beyond this second tier of bubbles several other young star clusters appear. It is not certain that the owe their existence to the activity in two inner active zones.\r\n\r\nAfter the initial star-burst in the central cluster, the second ring of star-bursts appear to have been initiated about 2M years later. At the current time, both levels of star-burst activity have infrared proto-stars O-type stars, ZAMS O stars (ZAMS is astronomer talk for “Zero Age Main Sequence”), and O3 stars (which have a very strong ionize helium line thought to indicate extreme youth). (Walborn, et al., 1992)\r\n\r\nA dramatic and interesting region, indeed.\r\n\r\nProcessing: This image mapped the narrowband data into their appropriate broadband locations, and performed a photometric calibration. Subsequent processing accented the cloud structure and tonal variations, largely with the aid of artificial-intelligence image-processing algorithms.",
