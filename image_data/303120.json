    "description": "Hello! This is my version of the Horsehead Nebula - Hubble Legacy Archives - Hope you enjoy! :-) \r\n\r\nThis image was assembled and processed using WFC3_110W for Blue and WFC3_160W for Red...synthetic Green created and processed at Photoshop. Pixinsight used for deconvolution and specific denoises, tiny galaxies colored and processed (like little contrast ) one by one... :-) Three days of work ( 8 hours at the computer/ day)...one day trying to get the colors ok and handle with PS crashing when multilayering the image...:-)\r\n\r\n*IOTD update:\r\n\r\nTHANKS A LOT! :-) ",
