    "description": "Captured over the months of March, April, and May which had only a few scattered clear nights, the LRGB image has over 18 hours of data.  Being new to the art, I have tried to resist the urge for the flamboyant and grandiose which tends to creep into my image processing sessions and endeavored to try let the data lead to a more natural and pleasing result.  For those more experience, my ears are always open to creative criticism, and dialogues on the aesthetics. I hope you enjoy the image.",
