    "description": "After a first run on Jupiter, then Mars, I thought the seeing was getting much better so I went back to Jupiter in the hopes of a run with the recent Perijove path of the Juno space probe fairly central. And it was really extraordinary seeing for 4 RGB runs before it went off again. As a result the resolution of the Juno Perijove path is very good and significantly better than my previous efforts where the seeing wasnâ€™t as good.\r\nIn the STB to the north and on the p side of the Oval BA, there is a subtle series of what look like light purple waves against the white of the STB just south of the SEB. Immediately on the p side of A8 there is an interesting feature which has a north-south component and then on its p side a series of radiating arms. The structure inside the Oval BA is quite well resolved and shows a dark centre and brighter ring inside the dark annulus. It has a touch of red colour at the extremities to my eyes. In the NEB there is an extremely bright break out and the festoon to its south is enormously dark. In fact I was looking through the eyepiece in another scope and it was so prominent, I went back to the feed on the computer screen to see in more detail what it was.",
