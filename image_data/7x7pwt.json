    "description": "What I really like about this object are the trail of small dark globules suspended  in front of the core. This is quite a large image composed of 9 frames of 5 minute subs in the Hubble Pallet using SII, HA and OIII  filters. Imaging mosaics can be a handful as it can take weeks to complete and conditions, in particular humidity, can vary  a lot so balancing the subs can be a pain.\r\nI will also post the OIII only as I find it is the stand-out filter for capturing extended nebulosity and detail.",
