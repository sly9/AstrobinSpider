    "description": "This is a resized image of Ganymede captured alongside Jupiter in my image from 6 May 2018 seen at https://www.astrobin.com/345615/B/.\r\nThe improved detail on Ganymede was achieved by placing an alignpoint in AS3! around the moon for improved stacking. The resized image is presented as an insert alongside a similar time stamped graphic from Virtual Planet Atlas. The main features line up pretty well, especially the bright lava flows around the crater Osaris at the bottom of the image.",
