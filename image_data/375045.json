    "description": "Arp 104 aka Keenan's system. Interacting galaxies joined by a galactic bridge of material, along with few other galaxies in the FoV, biggest of which is NGC5205\r\n\r\n10\" newt back in action in full since this image :) Took me some time to process some other images to get to this one, and I gotta say, for me personally, this galaxy looks amazing, really love the way it turned out :) there are minor issues as per usual though. I could have gotten more RGB frames, more L frames and that core of the galaxy is just screaming for more resolution :) Lot's and lot's of background galaxies and faint stars. Using Astrometrica, I found few mag 24.0 stars, so that's pretty great :)",
