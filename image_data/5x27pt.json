    "description": "About eleven thousand years ago a star in the constellation of Vela could be seen to explode, creating a strange point of light briefly visible to humans living near the beginning of recorded history. The outer layers of the star crashed into the interstellar medium, driving a shock wave that is still visible today (from NASA)\r\n\r\nThis image is centered on Cederblad 106, a small slice of this huge object.",
