    "description": "This is a detail from a four-frame mosaic I did on April 4, 2019. It is the beginning of a large panorama of the Milky Way that I'll be working on over the next few months. Each panel of the mosaic will be a stack of roughly one hour's worth of exposures. Additional data will be captured in Bortle 1 and 2 skies. Camera is an unmodified Canon 5DS R. Really Right Stuff pano head on Fornax LighTrack II to help keep track of overlapping.  Location was Black Gap Wildlife Refuge. Exposures were 60\" @ f/2 @ ISO 1600.",
