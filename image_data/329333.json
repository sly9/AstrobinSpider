    "description": "I imaged this in April of last year and only now got it to a stage where I'm happy (kinda!) with it... The overwhelming abundance of Hydrogen in this object makes it really difficult to get the colour balance right, but this will do for now! I'm just glad I don't have to think about it anymore.. Unless I grab some rgb stars with year to add to it? Maybe. This is also the second time I've imaged this, but last time was with a different scope/ccd combo. It's interesting to see the difference and how far I've come. Hopefully I'm heading in the right direction!",
