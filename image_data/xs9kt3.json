    "description": "A phase of the moon, the main attraction of which is the Sinus Iridum and a fan of elongating shadows that looks like a shark's gaping maw. An unusual sight. It is difficult to photograph it because the amount of light on the terminator is very small. It is difficult to process, because you have to extract details from the dark part of the material. It is also difficult to record avikas, because the technical side of my equipment requires the use of high gain and long exposures around 20ms (I believe that this is the basic barrier to achieving good results with poor seeing). The attractiveness of the phenomenon drew me to my morning escapade under the \"deceptive\" August sky. My ally turned out to be a new technique of folding photos - multistacking. It convinces me more and more and shows its benefits more clearly in poor conditions. I used 8 avics for multistacking (1600/16000).",
