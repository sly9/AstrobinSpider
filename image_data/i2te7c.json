    "description": "This image shows a region of interstellar material and dust illuminated by nearby stars. This dust also blocks the visible light from background stars and objects. The central part of this image is LBN 10. Imbedded in this LBN structure is the dark nebula LDN 134. LDN 134 is divided into three parts, (a, b, and c). Interestingly, there are a number of background galaxies that are mostly pretty distant - upwards of 300 million light years by redshift estimate.  These objects and some of the brighter stars are identified in the <a href=\"http://www.jthommes.com/Astro/images/LDN134_MN152_PI2_PS2_IP1_Crp_annotated.jpg\">annotated image</a>. Horizontal FOV is approximately 85 arc minutes. Full size image scale is 1.82 arcsec/pix.",
