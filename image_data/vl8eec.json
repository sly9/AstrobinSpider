    "description": "NGC 7331 is the dominant galaxy in this field. It is the brightest member of the Deer Lick Group - consisting of NGC 7331 and the smaller galaxies NGC 7335, 7336, 7337, 7340. This is an optical grouping since NGC 7331 is  much less distant (46 mly) than the other four (260+ mly). NGC 7335, 7337, 7340 are actually members of the physically associated group HDC 1198 (centered 268 mly distant). A 2012 paper, Giant Galaxies, Dwarfs, and Debris (GGADDS), identified satellite dwarfs associated with NGC 7331. These are identified as NGC 7331 A, B, C, and D.  There are also a number of background galaxies in this field. These galaxies  are identified in the <a href=\"http://www.jthommes.com/Astro/images/NGC7331_Edge7_PS3-Crp-IP_annotated.jpg\">annotated image</a>.     Horizontal FOV is approximately 38 arc minutes (0.87 arcsec/pix image scale on the full size image).",
