From earth, \r\ngalaxies are distributed along a smooth curve. messier\r\n\r\nTwo of them, M84 and M86, were \r\nfirst discovered in 1781, but the makarian chain eventually\r\n\r\nThe name of Benjamin Markarian,\r\n an Armenian astrophysicist\r\n\r\nNaming,he discovered their common movement in the early 1960s. \r\nMacallan used a prism to patrol the sky,\r\n\r\nMore than 800 galaxies \r\nwith abnormal blue nuclei have been found, so they are named Macallan\r\n\r\nThe member galaxies \r\ninclude M84 (NGC 4374), M86 (NGC 4406),\r\n NGC 4477, NGC 4473, NGC 4461, NGC 4458, NGC 4438 and NGC 4435,\r\n\r\nThe makarian chain is part\r\n of the Virgo Cluster\r\n\r\nThe Virgo Cluster\r\n is the closest Galaxy Group in our galaxy. It contains more than 2000 galaxies and has \r\na strong gravitational attraction to\r\n the local galaxy group around our galaxy.\r\n\r\nAt least seven galaxies in the galaxy chain seem to be coherent. If you look at \r\nthis picture carefully, we can see that there are dark dust clouds scattered in the background of the galaxy. At first, \r\nI thought\r\n\r\nIt's integrated flux nebula, IFN.\r\n\r\nLater, I was told that they did not belong to the Milky way. In fact, \r\nthese faint nebulae are all formed by the interaction between galaxies, also known as diffuse intracluster light (ICL),\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n an example of such ICL can be seen in this image, which clearly shows the extended tidal flow generated by Galaxy interaction.",
