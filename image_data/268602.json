Exactly same imaging systems were used for both data, except 1.6x Q-exteneder for my data taken in Jangsu, South Korea, providing higher resolution for the galaxies details. By the way, DSW data from New Mexico are so deep that the faint tidal interacting features between three galaxies, could be enhanced. ",
