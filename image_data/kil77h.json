    "description": "This is the second image processed with my new histogram balancing technique. Here is a brief description I posted earlier in response to an inquiry. \r\n\r\nAdjust the histograms of areas selected by their luminance as you would the entire image. In making those selections, be sure to feather them by about 25% of the width of the selection. There are about five areas worthy of selection in this image. Be sure to start with the original uncorrected SHO starless image. \r\n\r\nHope that helps.",
