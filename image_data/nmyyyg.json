    "description": "In my quest to try to improve my galaxy processing skills, I tried a Pro Data Set from Telescope Live of Centaurus A, also known as NGC 5128.  This was a relatively small set of data which consisted of 30 minutes each of RGB @600s and 1 hour of Luminance @600s, I must say the quality of the data was good (I just wish there would have been more of it)....but it seemed to produce a fairly good image (you might think differently).\r\nCentaurus A resides in the Southern constellation Centaurus at a distance of 12,000,000 light-years.  It is a peculiar massive elliptical galaxy having a supermassive black hole at it's center whose mass is around 100,000,000 solar masses.  Its diffuse cloudy elliptical shape is due to the hundreds of billions of stars contained in this galaxy.  The bright nucleus is partially obscured by a dark band of gas and dust with bright young star clusters and Ha regions throughout the band.  Some astronomers think that the dark band is the remains of a spiral galaxy that merged with this giant elliptical.\r\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\r\nTom",
