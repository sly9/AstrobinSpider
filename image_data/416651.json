    "description": "Jupiter on the evening of Sat 20 Jul 2019 UTC.\r\n\r\nImaged the King of Planets after one month hiatus due to home network and pc upgrade.  The disk has visibly shrunk since my last recording session near the end of June (by about 2 arc seconds). Here I've derotated 13 minutes of consecutive 80 second stacks catching interesting detail within setting GRS and SEB/STZ boundary immediately preceding the storm. This is a middle period from a two hour recording session.\r\n\r\nThe view combines 8137 best frames taken between 7:40 and 7:54 pm Canberra time.",
