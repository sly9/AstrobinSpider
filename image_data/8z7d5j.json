    "description": "The Rosette Nebula is a large, spherical region of Hydrogen Alpha gas and dust. It is located over 5,200 light years away and is 65 light years in radius. The Rosette nebula is a popular target amongst us astrophotographers, due to its massive size and brightness.\r\n\r\nThis was my second go at Bi-Colour imaging, consisting of Ha and OIII data. I took a particularly long time adjusting the colours to how I like, whilst bringing out the OIII data more to show its full glory.",
