    "description": "A couple caveats:\r\n\r\n1. I did actually use some of my data from my <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/286165/>previous attempt in 2017</a> making the total hours of integration 33.9 hours. I didn't include this in the total for a couple reasons, the main one being that I mostly used those data for fixing some overly skewed stars due to the collimation woes that I mentioned in my <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/bup3h3/>Thor's Helmet</a> image, but it did also end up in the superlum stack and Ha stack as well.\r\n\r\n2. Like I said: My collimation is off. Zoom in at your own peril (pixel peepers: You've been warned). This was actually a little worse than Thor's Helmet, because I only imaged on one side of the Meridian. I took the scope completely apart on Wednesday and found two possible sources of the collimation problems I've been plagued with since January. Hopefully I fixed everything - I should know by Friday morning.\r\n\r\nAnyway: How cool is it that I got a trace of that tidal stream from my Bortle 7+ location? I wouldn't have thought it possible, but I actually saw a trace of it in an early lum test stack. I must have really messed up my flats in 2017 to have not gotten it.",
