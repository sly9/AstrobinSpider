    "description": "Heckathorn Fesen Gull 1 is an interesting planetary nebula close to Abell 6 which is also a planetary. The information is mainly contributed by the blue Oiii, and partly from Halpha. The color and luminance information is injected into the otherwise quite plain star field. So, the strength is somewhat subjective. Hope you like my choice.\r\n\r\nRH-305's small focal ratio (3.8) is a great help in capturing the background dust information.",
