    "description": "M33 captured in LRGB,Ha. Taken from PixelSkies, Spain www.pixelskiesastro.com\r\n\r\nThe Triangulum Galaxy is a spiral galaxy 2.73 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Triangulum. It is cataloged as Messier 33 or NGC 598. The Triangulum Galaxy is the third-largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, behind the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. It is one of the most distant permanent objects that can be viewed with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nThe galaxy is the smallest spiral galaxy in the Local Group and is believed to be a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy or on its rebound into the latter due to their interactions, velocities, and proximity to one another in the night sky. It also has an H II nucleus.\r\n\r\nSeparately from the galaxy itself; the nebula eventually obtained NGC number 604. As seen from Earth, NGC 604 is located northeast of the galaxy's central core. It is one of the largest H II regions known, with a diameter of nearly 1500 light-years and a spectrum similar to that of the Orion Nebula.\r\n\r\n\r\nLum 35x600Secs\r\nRed 24x600Secs\r\nGreen 28x600Secs\r\nBlue 27x600Secs\r\nHa 37x1200Secs\r\n\r\n\r\n31 hours 20 mins in total.\r\n\r\nEquipment used:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Tec 140 F7\r\n\r\nCamera: Xpress Trius SX-694 Mono Cooled to -10C\r\n\r\nImage Scale: 0.95 \r\n\r\nGuiding: OAG\r\n\r\nFilters: Astronomik LRGB, Ha\r\n\r\nMount: iOptron CEM60 \"Standard\" GOTO Centre Balanced Equatorial Mount\r\n\r\nImage Acquisition: Sequence Generator Pro\r\n\r\nStacking and Calibrating: Pixinsight\r\n\r\nProcessing: Pixinsight 1.8, Photoshop CC",
