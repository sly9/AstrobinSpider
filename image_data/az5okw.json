    "description": "Around New Year's Eve 2019/20 I used five clear nights for taking Hα and [OIII]-filtered exposures of IC 410, the Tadpole Nebula, with my 4.9\" Wright-Newtonian telescope in my backyard in Vienna, Austria. Conditions varied from windy to calm and humid, with air temperatures between -3 and +3 degrees Celsius. Transparency was not always good, I had to discard many sub-optimal exposures when either thin clouds passed through or the object was too low in the light-polluted sky or guiding errors resulted in trailed stars. Nonetheless, I acquired 10 hours of usable Hα exposures and 5 hours of [OIII], enough for a decent image. I did not attempt [SII] exposures.\r\n\r\nProcessing steps: File selection and bias/dark/flat calibration, star alignment and image integration, noise reduction, deconvolution, non-linearization, star-background separation, local contrast enhancement, color synthesis using tone mapping, color correction, star size reduction, re-adding of the stars\r\n\r\nTonemap composition:\r\n\r\nRed = Hα\r\nGreen = [OIII]\r\nBlue = [OIII] + 15% Hα to compensate for missing Hβ\r\n\r\nMaster Luminance composition:\r\n\r\nL = Hα  + 30% [OIII]\r\n\r\nSome color-tweaking was required after tone mapping because the result was too greenish.  The nebula's center glows bright in [OIII] light, colored blue, while the Tadpoles, which protrude into the center from the upper left, and all of the nebula's outskirts are dominated by red-colored Hα emission. Red structures in the upper right corner belong to the neighboring Flaming Star Nebula IC 405.",
