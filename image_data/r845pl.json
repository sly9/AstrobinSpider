    "description": "LDN 673 consists of a complex of dark clouds sillhouetted against the bright background of the summer milky way in the constellation of Aquila - in many ways this looks like ancient hieroglyphs scrawled over the night sky. \r\n\r\nThere is a small yellowish nebula in the western (right) boundary of the upper portion of the main dark lane, and appears to be catalogued as GN 19.18.0 and Bernes 16. There's also lots of other interesting smaller nebula in and around the region, especially around the T Tauri multiple star system AS 353, where multiple Herbig-Haro objects have been discovered - that would make a very interesting close up study.\r\n\r\nAcquisition: Graeme Coates and Paul Tribe\r\nProcessing: Graeme Coates",
