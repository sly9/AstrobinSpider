    "description": "Another photo among clouds that came out with good definition. So I can not make an acceptable sequence to create a GIF with smooth movements. Highlight for the Oval BA that is currently quite prominent.\r\nWith all those clouds that always have in the morning until I'm doing well!\r\nToday I got up at 4:30 a.m. I looked up and I did not believe! I turned to the east and saw that there was a hole coming towards me, I thought to myself: That's where I'm going to get it, give it!",
