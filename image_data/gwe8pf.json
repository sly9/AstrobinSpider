    "description": "Two panel mosaic of the Polaris Flare. There was a total of 354 120-second light frames split between the two panels. I shot this with my modded Canon 600D, iEXOS-100 mount, and Rokinon 135mm f/2 lens at f/2.4. I guided with PHD2 and dithered every three frames. I had to rotate the guide scope about 30 degrees in declination away from the pole in order for PHD2 to calibrate, which made dithering weird but the movement in declination appeared to be effective.\n\nCalibrated with 30 darks, flats, and dark flats and stacked in APP, followed by star reduction via Starnet++, and final adjustments in GIMP. The background is a bit mottled as I didn't like what noise reduction was doing to the dust, so the noise from the old DSLR is apparent. Comments/feedback welcome and appreciated!",
