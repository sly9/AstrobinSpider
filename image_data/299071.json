    "description": "The Snake Nebula (Barnard 72) is a dark nebula silhouetted against the dense stars in Ophiuchus.  It is part of the Smoke in the larger Pipe Nebula about 650 light years away.  The very dark spot to the lower right of the Snake is Barnard 68 (the Ink Spot), also one of Barnard’s dark nebulae.  I had to crop some of the frame because a huge reflection from nearby Saturn ruined part of my FOV.  Here is my version of the Snake:\r\n\r\nCanon 6D\r\nSV80 @ 480mm f/6\r\n20 x 360 sec",
