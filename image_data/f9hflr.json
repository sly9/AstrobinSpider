    "description": "The bright blue reflection nebula in this image (Van den Bergh 152, Cederblad 201) sits at the end of a long, curved dark nebula (Barnard 175).  This complex is known as 'Wolf's Cave' nebula.  The name derives from the German astronomer Max Wolf (1863 â€“ 1932), based at the University of Heidelberg and described in several references as a 'pioneer in astrophotography'.  Wolf believed that the complex looked like a cave, hence it became known as 'Wolf's Cave'.\r\n\r\nWolf's Cave is located around 1,400 light years away in the constellation of Cepheus.\r\n\r\nThe complex was photographed between 25 and 29 September 2019 from a remote imaging rig that is jointly owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me. \r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nCamera: QSI 683 WSG\r\nFilters: Astrodon LRGB\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nLum: 42 x 600s\r\nRed: 24 x 600s\r\nGreen: 24 x 600s\r\nBlue: 24 x 600s\r\n\r\nA total of 19 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage processing: Steve Milne",
