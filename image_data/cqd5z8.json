    "description": "Originally a two panel mosaic using an Atik 11000 large format camera, this now has added data at higher resolution from an Atik 460 to enhance the Ghost region. The image has over 70 hours of data but given the piecemeal way in which it has evolved I'm afraid I can't be more precise. Filters were LRGB. The high res data added recently really only matters when the image is seen at full size.",
