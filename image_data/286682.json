    "description": "It's been nothing but clouds and terrible weather this winter in Bend.   I finally got a single clear night early in February with the moon pretty high in the sky.  I had some trouble getting things up and running and it took a while before the wind finally died down.  Orion started out pretty high in the sky so I was only able to get 7 good 20 minute subs on the Horsehead before it sank toward into the western horizon.  My hopes to add even one more night of data have been dashed in continuous waves of bad weather so it looks like this is all I'll get this year.  It's not nearly enough data for what I originally had in mind but I thought that I'd post it anyway.  My camera has developed some minor problems and I had a serious stray from Alnitak so I had to do a bit of hand work to salvage this image.  This image shows the un-cropped full frame of the 16803 sensor and it's not a bad demo of what can be done in only two hours on the Horsehead.  (Give me another 3 nights of clear sky and I can blow this image away!)   I'm beginning to think that I'm going to have to move the scope to a better location if I want to shoot the winter sky.  I've only snagged 1.3 images this winter and that's just pathetic.   C&C is always welcome so fire away.\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\n\r\nRev B:  I've always thought about simulating color for a NB Ha image so I  thought that I'd try it with this image.  It's a bit harder to see detail but its' worth sharing.  Let me know what you think.",
