    "description": "Here we have a new version of Copernicus.  I made this one using a second hand Astromania 3x Barlow that I found at a second hand astronomy shop in Tucson.  The image seems to have come out pretty nice even with that as a weak link in the imaging train.\r\n\r\nI believe we had some extraordinary seeing on this night as well but it was quite breezy.  The breezy conditions affected my framing quite a bit as I had to crop the image to rid it of stacking artifacts.  That was a little disappointing as I had hope to have the Fauth craters, the Reinhold craters and one of the Gay-Lussac craters in the frame.  But overall, I am quite pleased with this one and believe it is much better than my previous efforts.  \r\n\r\nThe crater is about 93km in diameter and 3.8km deep.  It is thought to have been the result of an impact of a several km in width body about 800 million years ago. \r\n\r\nA question for anyone who may have thoughts in this:  I was thinking about the facts that, as we all know, the moon is bound to the earth gravitationally and the earth is also bound to the moon gravitationally, would an enormous impact like this on the moon be felt upon the earth considering the fact that these two bodies are gravitationally bound? \r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you like this-  Clear Skies and good health...",
