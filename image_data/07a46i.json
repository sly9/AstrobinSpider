It occupies on 0.4% of the RCOS’s image frame; so this image is greatly enlarged and aggressively cropped (to about 9% of the full frame size). \r\nThis nebula planetary, as with all planetary nebulae, results from a moderate-size (sun like) star reaching its end of life. The star expands into a Red Giant, and expels it outer atmosphere. The expelled shell is ionized by the exposed core of the star and ‘shines’ as a planetary nebula. IC 5148, at about 3000 light-years, is the fastest expanding planetary nebulae known. It is expanding at about 50 km/sec. Planetary nebulae are thought to dissipate and fade from detection in a few tens of thousands of years. In the process of blending into the galaxy’s background of gas, they enrich that interstellar medium with elements heavier than the primordial hydrogen and abundant helium.\r\n\r\nThis is 'natural' color in that Ha was mixed into the red channel and OIII was mixed into the gree and blue channels.",
