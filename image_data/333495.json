    "description": "The Carina Nebula is a large, complex area of bright and dark nebulosity in the constellation Carina, and is located in the Carinaâ€“Sagittarius Arm. The nebula lies at an estimated distance between 6,500 and 10,000 light-years from Earth. The nebula is one of the largest diffuse nebulae in our skies. Although it is some four times as large and even brighter than the famous Orion Nebula, the Carina Nebula is much less well known due to its location in the southern sky.\r\nEta Carinae is a highly luminous hypergiant star. Estimates of its mass range from 100 to 150 times the mass of the Sun, and its luminosity is about four million times that of the Sun.",
