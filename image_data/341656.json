    "description": "This was an interesting project.  The image is actually a group of NINE images stitched together.  The TOTAL time here was 115 HOURS of open camera time.  It took about a year to get all the data and then assemble the mosaic into one image. \r\n\r\nFor you science guys, as you know this is an HII region with very active star formation ongoing.\r\nImagine what happened to clear that central region, must have been one wopper of a supernove, hypernova???\r\n\r\nYou too can be taking images like this by renting time on our system.  Go to our web page to learn more or just call us, phone number top left corner!!!\r\n\r\nwww.darkestskies.com",
