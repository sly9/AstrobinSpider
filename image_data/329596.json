    "description": "First complete LRGB with FSQ + ML16200 + 10Micron GM1000 from DSW.  Very happy with this combination.  Added a Nightcrawler and I think this is a life-long system.  So far the mount is the star of the show.   It's feature-rich yet easy to use and fades to the background.  RMS is typically 0.10 to 0.15.  It is a guided system which issues a guide correction fewer than 1 time per minute under moderately good skies (seeing = 1.5 - 2.5).  The camera is good and the scope is definitely tried and true.",
