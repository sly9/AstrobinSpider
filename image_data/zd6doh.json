    "description": "Finally, on the very last day of this horrible 2020, I'm publishing a new image hoping for a better 2021...\r\nI was able to spend an entire winter night shooting at just this subject togheter with my friend Maurizio Mollica. We where lucky enough to spot one single night of good weather in Italy on this December. We went to a quite dark place where trasparency was good enough to make an attempt at this faint dusty nebula. The seeing was not good (between 4\" and 5\") and also some very thin clouds passed along the night. Humidity was high in the sky so some scatter has happened to many frames but I decided to use it anyway to increase overall SNR. We've used two setups in parallel shooting at the same target, mine was my usual \"portable\" one with the Takahashi Epsilon 210 and the one of Maurizio has a Takahashi TSA 102 coupled with a SBIG 8300 on a 10Micron GM2000HPS.\r\nThogheter we've collected more tha 9 hours of luminance data and about 2 hours of each RGB channel.\r\nAnyway thanks to Maurizio for sharing his data with me and happy new year to all of You!",
