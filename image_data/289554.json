    "description": " Caldwell 3 or NGC 4236 located in Draco. A 11MLY distant, barred spiral galaxy with a diameter of 75.000 lightyears. It's a part of M81 Group and contains more than 100 billion stars. Not far from edge on, it spans 22' x 7' making it a nice big, target for us.  Although it is pretty faint , so prepare to gather lot of photons.\r\nIn the background lot of distant , \"tiny\" galaxies are visible. Some seem to interact with each other.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe data comes from a co-operation with http://www.astrobin.com/users/xordi/ . Go and visit him for another version. I think I'll give it another processing try , maybe with more data.\r\n",
