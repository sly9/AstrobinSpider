    "description": "Again visiting my friend Hans in his beautiful dark garden in the Rh√∂n mountains. This time NGC 5033 was our target. Finishing luminance and green on this stunning dark site, I managed blue and red data at my backyard. As I read in a book the bright core of this distorted  SA galaxy contains a giant black hole. I am quite proud of the small background galaxies, which I only could image due to the super dark sky in that area, which is about 1 car hour away from me. Hope you like it too...\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph\r\n\r\nPS. My friend Hans is now deeply infected with astrofotography. Let's see what will happen thereüòÅ",
