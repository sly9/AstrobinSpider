    "description": "I made 7 RGB runs with the GRS quite central. The last 3 captures for each colour channel looked better so I did a test to compare the integration of all 7 runs versus the last 3. There was a very slight benefit in resolution by integrating less, but better runs. However the two images are very comparable but with a timestamp 6.5mins apart. I made this animation to show just how much the planet rotates in this short time. It never ceases to amaze me.\r\nThe seeing was good and the resolution excellent.",
