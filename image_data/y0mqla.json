    "description": "This image is yet another completed challenge, the result of a short time of capture in a sky with heavy light pollution.\r\nThere were only 27 luminance frames, but only 16 left to stack because in the others I had problems with clouds and guiding.\r\nAfter all, the result with only 32 minutes of luminance integration is not to be put in the trash can. I'm glad for that.\r\n\r\nNGC 4945 is na edge-on spiral galaxy in the constellation Centaurus. Its about 13 million light years distant- only six times farther away than the prominent Andromeda Galaxy.\r\nThat is one of the brightest galaxies within the Centaurus A/M83 Group - a large, nearby group of galaxies. The galaxy is the second brightest within the group, after Centaurus A (NGC5128).",
