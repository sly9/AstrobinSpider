    "description": "This is about 5hrs each of OII and Ha data from the 8in SCT. This nebula (unsurprisingly) is super dim in Ha, so the majority of the signal was OIII. I was unsure whether this one is supposed to be more greenish or blueish, however, most of the images here on A-Bin are on the blue side.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a neat nebula though, it is almost perfectly round.",
