    "description": "CTA 1 is a very dim supernova remnant in Cepheus. \r\n\r\nThe bright object at about 8 o'clock is the unrelated planetary nebula NGC 40.\r\n\r\nI had a look for PSR J0007+7303, the first ever high magnetic field pulsar to be  discovered through its gamma-ray pulsations, but it didn't appear to be visible optically.\r\n\r\nAcquisition credit: Scott Johnson, Augusto Hernandez, John Kasianowicz, Daniele Malleo, Jose Mtanous and Rick Stevenson\r\n\r\nProcessing credit: Rick Stevenson\r\n\r\nTarget suggestion: Sakib Rasool",
