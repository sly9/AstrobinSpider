    "description": "The cave nebula is a beautiful object  in Cepheus - and it also taught me a lesson: Without proper research I went imaging this and spend long hours on narrowband. I think altogether 18 hours went into O3 and SII. However, it turned out to be almost impossible (for me) to get something decent out of it. When I checked out other images, I found most of them to be RGB images. So I restarted last week to capture RGB, and all was much easier. So lesson learned, next time it is a bit of research before imaging ;-).\r\n\r\nSo here is my RGB cave, the R channel was pimped with Ha. Otherwise straight forward RGB worklow, the starless process only helped to get a good star mask.\r\n\r\n296 x 60s RGB\r\n64 x 300s Ha",
