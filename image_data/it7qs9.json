    "description": "A close up of the iconic structure in the Rosette Nebula I have dubbed the Perch.  I just noticed the hands pointing upward near the base of the pillar, similar to the hand pointing from the SII regions of the Wizard Nebula.  Perhaps there is some reason for such shapes to appear in the interstellar emissions beyond our tendency to  anthropomorphize such objects.  This landscape has Dr. Seuss written all over it.  It is another FOV I simply must revisit with more aperture.",
