    "description": "Cotton Ball time! That's what globular clusters look like in a visual scope, but much more detail comes out when imaging. This one is Messier 13, the second largest in our night scky (second only to Omega Centauri, a southern hemisphere object). It is a little less than 200ly across and contains several hundred thousand stars.",
