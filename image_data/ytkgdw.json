    "description": "This is a short project I made while waiting for the availability of what I was planning to shoot that two nights. Again, due to high gain with this camera I got uncorrectable dark current noise and had to crop, but this time I managed to remain reasonably framed. HOO (my first one ever) gave me really greenish Oxygen, nice but I liked the blues more, so processed it to obtain it that way.  As I rarely see the nebula close up as here, I decided to show it full res, despite some waknesses are more prone. Enjoy and comment :)",
