    "description": "My favorite galaxy M51 this time. It was captured last spring, but I have found time for processing only now. That was a test of my new telescope from Lacerta, paired with SX694 camera. I'm very happy with a purchase. Had to crop this image a little bit, just to get rid off a bright star, that turned out weird during processing,  no matter how hard I tried to avoid it. In general, I'm very happy with a final result.",
