    "description": "Super interesnting area from the geological point of view, besides the high albedo of the inner crater walls of  Aristarchus exposing the bright  anorthositic rocks of the upper lunar crust through the impact  and transporting them to the nearby surface of the Crater. It is also the \r\nSchröter’s Valley, partially visible in the image (I was one day too early imaging), being the largest and longest sinuous rille on  the Moon, is also a lava tube, where, after the lava flow came to an end,  the roof collapsed exposing the valley... just figuring out those huge \"tubes\" is mind blowing...\r\n\r\nHowever in this image I wanted to stress the wonderful transition of mineral composition in the basaltic maria with the colorful distinction that brings the contents of iron and titanium (blueish, in this case grey because of the lack of incident light). This area is  one of the most colourful reas in the moon... a pity that the Schroter valley is not clearly visible, as besides its beauty, it also holds a distinctive albedo and subtle color variation...\r\n\r\nThe followed processing process is as follows:\r\n\r\n40k takes  keeping 10%  from autostakert then registax ==> Lightroom (two copies of the result, one for sharpening and levels and the other one for colour signal):\r\n\r\n- B&H: Light sharpening with Topaz AI\r\n-Coloured: increase saturation and local contrast\r\n\r\nThen merged in Photoshop (color addition) and finally some noise reduction in pixinsight (MMT).\r\n\r\nCS, Guillermo",
