    "description": "This 2 panel mosaic captures a beautiful reflection nebula located 400 light years away in the constellation of Scorpius.  The Horsehead Nebula is my favorite deep sky object.  This horsehead, the much large Blue Horsehead, was much more difficult to image and process because of its large scale and delicate nebulousity. \r\n\r\nThe nebula consists primarily of  two reflection nebulae - IC 4592, the \"eye\" of the horse, and IC 4601, the \"ear\" of the horse.  In addition, a wonderful molecular cloud extends throughout the whole image.  My favorite parts of the image are actually the darker parts - the black dark nebulae at upper right, and the numerous dusty brown patches at lower left.  I also like the dark bands which extend through the yellow and blue reflection nebulae of IC 4601, as well as the crisp bright blue reflection ridge that spans the upper boundary of IC 4592.",
