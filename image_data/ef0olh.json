    "description": "This is one of my favorite objects in the Southern Hemisphere. Although it is quite faint, patient processing brings out some scary details. What do we have here? An underwater monster rising up to snatch the unsuspecting galaxy?\r\n\r\nCometary globules werenâ€™t recognized until 1976, when they were detected by the UK Schmidt Telescope in Australia. Although the head  of CG4 is opaque, it glows with light from nearby very hot stars. The red color probably comes from excited hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThere are two theories about how the unique shape of cometary globules developed. One theory holds that they were originally spherical nebula that were disrupted by a nearby supernova explosion. The other theory is that were shaped by stellar winds and radiation from hot, massive stars.\r\n\r\nTech Notes for ASA 500/3.6:\r\nASA Newtonian, 500 mm aperture, 1900mm focal length, F3.6\r\nFLI Proline 16803, 9 mm pixel, 4096 X 4096\r\nASA DDM85 equatorial mount\r\nProcessing with PixInsight and Affinity Photo",
