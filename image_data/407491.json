    "description": "An earlier capture of Jupiter's GRS hemisphere, Sat 25 May 2019 AEST.\r\n\r\nThe planet was slightly higher in the sky for this view (72 degrees). I've combined more stacks for a shorter derotation period (12 minutes between 2:12 and 2:24 am LT).\r\n\r\nDespite higher overall frame count (approx. 6500) detail is still soft due to average seeing that night. GRS streamer remnants are beginning to cross the CM.",
