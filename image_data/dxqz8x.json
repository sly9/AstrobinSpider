    "description": "We enjoyed such a marvellous apparition of Mars in 2020. I put together this collage to show the changes in the planet over some 6months. In fact it covers the timeframe from June 18th, when the planet had a 10.5” diameter through opposition in the first week of October at ~ 22.5” to December 8th, when the diameter had shrunk back down to 13.4”. The middle two images are just each side of opposition but were pretty much at the maximum apparent diameter. \r\n\r\nMost of the faces of Mars can be seen here and I was very lucky to have good conditions especially around opposition to resolve fine detail. There was significant dust storm activity in the lead up to opposition, especially towards the end of June, not seen here, but through opposition the planet was totally clear. Then after opposition, an interesting dust storm blew up and this can be seen in the third image from the right.\r\n\r\nNote how the planet’s phase changed through the apparition. In the first image Mars was only 84% illuminated and the terminator was to the right in these north up images. That is about it’s minimum phase and occurs when the Mars-Earth-Sun angle is 90 degrees. At opposition the planet was of course, 100% illuminated. Then as the Earth swung past Mars in our orbit, the planet again showed a gibbous phase and the terminator switched to the other side of the planet. In the final image the planet was back down to 91% illuminated.\r\n\r\nNote also the massive shrinkage of the South Polar Cap, through the Martian summer.\r\n\r\nA most splendid apparition and a privilege to have witnessed and photographed it.",
