    "description": "The Heart Nebula in Cassiopeia at 7500 light years.    An intense star forming region frames Melotte 15.\r\n21.5 hrs for an HA-SHO artistic composition from August 18, 19 and 20th 2020.\r\n\r\nFirst full run trialing a new processing workflow using Topaz Studio 2 with integrating Denoise, Sharp and Adjust and the masking features as plug-ins.   I find it is still necessary to correct smaller star shapes after using the AI algorithms.  So far I've found that Topaz has many tools give a slight boost to small, mid and large detail/contrast, while adjust drives additional color depth that is beyond what I can achieve in other software.   A bonus of using Studio II integrated package is that masking and opacity options are available to balance the adjustments and can focus the AI algorithms on lighter details in the background.\r\n\r\nProcessing:\r\nInitial stacking in DSS (Average stacking, 22% culled for star trails, tracking issues).   21 hrs total.\r\nInitial background, stretch, HDR, decon, sharp, color at Red = S50H50, Green = S50H50, Blue = O100 in Startools (Ha - SHO) & denoise.\r\nTweaks Topaz Studio (AI Clear, basic adjustment, precision detail)\r\nDenoise AI with 50% weight & mask (lum ~33%) (low light)\r\nSharpening AI with 67% weight & mask (lum ~33%)\r\nAdjust AI no mask (20% weight)\r\nDehaze at 10%\r\nMask and replace stars in Startools.",
