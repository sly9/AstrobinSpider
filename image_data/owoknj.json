    "description": "Messier 82 is a starburst galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major, and lies some 12 million light years away.  It's around 5x more luminous than our own Milky Way and has prominent starburst activity that is thought to have been started by the gravitational interaction with neighboring M81.  It was initially thought to be an irregular type galaxy, but infrared observations show that has two spiral arms.  Surrounding the diffuse glow of the galaxy are brown dusty filament as well as intense red H-alpha emissions from the starburst regions.",
