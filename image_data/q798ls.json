    "description": "I've seen my fair share of solar transits, but today I finally captured my first ISS lunar transit! I had originally planned on using my scope and planetary camera to capture the event, but the first heatwave of the year came to California so I opted for a quicker and easier method to minimize my time in the heat. This was captured handheld with my Nikon D750 and 200-500mm f/5.6 lens. About 50 frames stacked, ISO 100 f/5.6 1/2000s. Processed in Photoshop and Lightroom. Goes to show that you don't always need a crazy setup to get some cool images!",
