    "description": "Messier 74 (also known as NGC 628) is a face-on spiral galaxy in the constellation Pisces. It is about 32 million light-years away from Earth. The galaxy contains two clearly defined spiral arms. M74 is the brightest member of the M74 Group, a group of 5-7 galaxies that also includes the peculiar spiral galaxy NGC 660 and a few irregular galaxies.  It is estimated that M74 is home to about 100 billion stars.\r\n\r\nProcessing information:\r\n\r\nDate: Oct 3,8,9,10,13 2010  Processing update in Nov 2018\r\nLocation: New Ringgold PA\r\nOptics: Hyperion f/8 12.5 inch, FL 2540 mm \r\nMount: Paramount ME\r\nCamera: Sbig STL-11000 Guiding: Internal\r\nExposure: LRGB: L:48x7 min R:31x5 min, G:27x5 min, B:26x5 min, Total= 12.6 hours\r\nProcessing: Image acquisition using CCD Autopilot.
