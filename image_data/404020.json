    "description": "First light with my new RASA 11\". Really impressed with it so far, and how well it seemed to hold focus through the imaging session, and smaller/sharper stars versus the HyperStar setup I had before. Some slight diffraction spikes, due to not properly routing the cables. Certainly a big and heavy scope to lift on to the mount (I have to setup each time!)\r\n\r\nI had quite an obvious blue gradient on the lower left corner which DBE in PixInsight couldn't fix easily (think I need to work on my flats), so I just used Lightroom to apply a graduated filter to lower the black level and saturation on that corner of the image, which helped.\r\n\r\nI like how I managed to capture some smaller (more distant) galaxies in the lower right corner of this image.",
