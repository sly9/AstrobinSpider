    "description": "Quick info: this gif may load for a bit depending on your connection and play a lot smoother on the second run-through.\r\n\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nbefore this year comes to a close I wanted to share something special with you. I've had this idea of animating my astro-photos for a while now, but didn't have the time to actually go through with it yet. Well now I have and this is my first result. A short journey to the Great Wall in the North America Nebula.\r\nTo make this look organic I used a combination of displacement maps, camera movements and particle systems to generate the illusion that you're actually flying through space to the great wall. I used Adobe After Effects for this.\r\nI thought about actually creating a 3D model so I could increase the rotational movement but I do not own any 3D modeling software anymore and it would've been a really expensive experiment.\r\nSo this subtle animation is what I came up with during my After Effects trial.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it and as we say in Germany \"Guten Rutsch\" - which means: have a good transition to 2018 :)",
