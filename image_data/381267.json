    "description": "Messier 1 (NGC 1952) – the Crab Nebula - is a supernova remnant approximately 6,500 light years away in the constellation of Taurus. The initial explosion was so bright that it could be seen on Earth during daylight; the supernova was first recorded as a ‘guest star’ by Chinese skywatchers on 4 July 1054.  It was then lost until it was rediscovered by British astronomer John Bevis in 1731.  Messier observed the nebula on 12 September 1758.  (Information adapted from: O’Meara, SJ, The Messier Objects: Second Edition: Cambridge University Press – 2014.)\r\n\r\nM1 was imaged between 17 November and 15 December 2018 from a remote imaging rig in Spain owned and operated by Barry Wilson and Steve Milne.\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon NB 3nm\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nSII: 24 x 1200s\r\nHa: 24 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 24 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 24 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData Capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
