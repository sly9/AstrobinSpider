    "description": "This is a reprocess of data I collected 3 years ago. My main objective then was to be able to reveal IFN. While I could see IFN in the L subs, I couldnt get it to show up in RGB the last time I processed it.\r\nWith more experience in processing, I decided to reattempt processing it and this time I was able to get the IFN show up in the final image. This definitely a fun processing job.\r\n\r\nIt is nice to be able to go back to saved data. I lost a bunch of data because I decided to store raw subs and flats but dont have the darks/bias from QSI690 :( . Only half the data was stored after calibration.\r\n\r\n2/23 - Image was lost in Astrobin and had to be reprocessed from stacked masters.",
