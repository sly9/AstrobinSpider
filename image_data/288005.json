    "description": "* Image Acquisition by Jim Misti / Steven Mazlin.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* Distance: 15 Mly.\r\n\r\nMessier 94 (NGC 4736) is a spiral galaxy located more than 15 million light years away (close to the Local Group) in the direction of the constellation of Canes Venatici,; has a diameter of 30.000 light-years and the core will be about 7.000 light-years.\r\n\r\nFrom the observation of the image stands out the extremely bright nucleus, surrounded by a pink ring where there is intense star formation, it is estimated that these stars have only 10 million years; the outer part of the disc, much less luminous, consists of many aged stars and small dispersed stellar maternities that have arisen due to shock waves caused by the collapse of massive stars at the end of life.",
