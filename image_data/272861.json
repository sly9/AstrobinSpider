    "description": "Now for the target that needs no introduction...\r\n\r\nI had a few technical challenges through the acquisition of this one, but the data seemed fairly reasonable in the end.   It's not too common to see a straight LRGB image of this without any narrowband.   Some of that dusty stuff is pretty faint and just begs for more integration to clean it up.  I don't know that I'll get back here for the rest of the season so I compiled what I had collected.   This is actually my first horsehead attempt.  \r\n\r\nI went to clean up the light flood from Alnitak, but a four year old says she likes the purple.  Who am I to argue?\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nEdit: The more I look at this the more I am convincing myself I need to hammer it with more integration. ",
