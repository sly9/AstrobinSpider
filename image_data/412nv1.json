    "description": "This image shows a number of dark and light nebulae in Cassiopeia.  The most prominent dark nebulae are (from left to right): LDN 1357 (just to the left and slightly above centre); LDN 1355 (above right of LDN 1357); and LDN 1358 (the largest).  The reflection nebulae are: VdB 9 (just to the left of SU Cass – the bright central star); and VdB 7 (the ultra faint nebula around RZ Cass – the bright blue star in the right lower part of the image).\r\n\r\nThese nebulae were photographed between 23 November and 29 December 2019 from a rig in Spain that is privately owned and remotely operated by Barry Wilson and me.  \r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nCamera: QSI 683\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nLum: 30 x 600s\r\nRed: 18 x 600s\r\nGreen: 18 x 600s\r\nBlue: 18 x 600s\r\n\r\nA total of 14 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
