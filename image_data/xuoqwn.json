    "description": "NGC 613 in Sculptor is a barred spiral galaxy of the SBbc(rs) type. Discovered by German-English astronomer William Herschel in 1798, the galaxy is 67,000,000 light years away. First photographed in 1912, NGC 613 has a bar across its nucleus, with a weak inner ring structure circling the bar, and moderate to loosely wound spiral arms. Star formation is occurring at the ends of the bar and extending along the well-defined spiral arms.  Many thanks go out to my collaborator and friend, Mike Selby, who acquired and calibrated this fine data.",
