    "description": "Sh2-115 is northwest of Deneb in the constellation Cygnus. It is a emission nebula whose complex glowing patterns are powered by an embedded open star cluster, Berkeley 90. In the top left of the frame is Abell 71 (PLN 85+4.1), now thought to be misclassified as a planetary nebula, but is an area of gas concentration associated with Sh2-115. All in all, it is a remarkably rich area of nebular structure in the night sky.",
