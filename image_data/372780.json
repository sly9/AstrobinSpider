    "description": "NGC 6769-6770-6771 form this superb triple system in the southern constellation of Pavo.  It is also known as the Devil's Mask.   The trio are 190 million light years away, and receding.  Both NGC 6769 and NGC 6770 are receding at similar velocities of about 3800 km/s - a redshift just over 0.01, while NGC 6771 is receding at a slightly higher rate of 4200 km/s.\r\n\r\nThe central bulge in all three galaxies are of similar brightness.  NGC 6771 has an interesting boxy shape which is indeed a rare occurrence among galaxies.  It is unusual in that it has two comparatively straight dark lanes and a fainter arc that curves towards the third galaxy\r\n\r\nBoth NGC 6769 and NGC 6770 are spiral galaxies, yet very different.  NGC 6769 has very tightly wound spiral arms, while NGC 6770 has two major spiral arms, one of which is fairly straight pointing towards the outer disc of NGC 6769.  The blueish colour of the spiral arms indicate the presence of many star forming regions.\r\n\r\nIC4845, a Barred Spiral Galaxy.  Its angular size is 1.207’ 0.893’ (arcmin).  Surprisingly, even with a modest instrument (25 cm), the galaxy presents remarkable fine details.  \r\n\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\nLum 37X900 Bin1X1\r\nRed 22X450 Bin2X2\r\nGreen 18X450 Bin2X2\r\nBlue 15X450 Bin2X2\r\nTotal time  hours\r\n\r\nInstruments Used:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftware Used\r\nCCDStack (calibration, alignment, data rejection, stacking)\r\nPhotoshop CS 6 (Image processing)\r\n\r\nThanks for looking",
