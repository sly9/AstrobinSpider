    "description": "IC410 also known as the \"Tadpole Nebula\", is an emission nebula located in the constellation Auriga. It is about 20,000 light years from Earth, and extends into space for about 100 light years.\r\n“The Tadpoles” are immersed in a cosmic pond of gas and dust. The cloud, partially obscured by dust in the foreground, surrounds NGC 1893, a young cluster of stars whose radiation causes the gas to glow. The region is home to major star formation processes generating large mass stars. Tadpoles, composed of denser and colder gas and dust, extend for about 10 light years and new stars could be born inside them. Their gaseous tails, sculpted by winds and radiation from massive newborn stars, stretch in the opposite direction to the central region of the cluster.",
