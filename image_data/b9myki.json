    "description": "Definitely the most difficult target I've worked on yet. The faint dark nebulosity and Ha nebulosity were very hard to pop out in the image especially since it's a very star-rich field. The blue nebulosity around the cocoon also required some special treatment. I will acquire more data on this target next year hopefully.",
