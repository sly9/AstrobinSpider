    "description": "Here we have my attempt at Messier 28.  This clobular in Sagittarius  lies about 18,000 light years away and contains about 50,000 stars.  It is classified as a Clas IV Globular which is described as \"intermediate rich concentration of stars and that the stellar density at the core region is visible but slightly spread out\".  There are a large number of differng types of variable stars in the cluster and it also contains 12 milisecond pulsars, one of them being the first ever discovered in a globular.  So a very strange and alien place for sure...\r\n\r\nThis object being in Sagittarius is accompanied by a very dense blanket of stars.  I hoped to be able to show this as is without de-emphasizing that densely populated background and I think that came out fairly good.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it and as always, comments/criticsm welcome...\r\n\r\nCS and be well.",
