    "description": "<b>The Bipolar Nebula is watching the Fighting Dragons</b>\r\n\r\nI know...it's a lame title, just my wild imagination...\r\n \r\nThree years ago I posted two images of the Bipolar emission nebula (NGC 6164,NGC6165) and the Rim nebula, Aka, the Fighting Dragons.\r\n\r\nThis time, with my wide-field telescope I had an opportunity to image both in one field. Unfortunately, due to Hubble Palette SHO processing method the emission nebula colors shown here are not as realistic as in my image from three years ago, otherwise I'm very pleased with the result here. I'm particularly glad that I managed to keep stars, especially those at the center of the star cluster NGC6193 nicely separated.\r\n\r\nRev B: Corrected blue color and applied HLVG to remove green cast\r\nRev C: Improved the blue hue around the dragons and some of the red color of the bipolar nebula",
