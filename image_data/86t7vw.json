    "description": "This image is a work in progress. It is planned to be a 2-panel mosaic of our beautiful neighboor galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Yesterday [as of posting date] I managed to capture a few frames - only 48 minutes in total. The data from the central \"main\" region was added from 2018's. The total integration is only 98 minutes, but I was happy with the result and decided to publish it as a work in progress. My objective is to at least duplicate this time in the following imaging opportunities, but, for now, this is a quick view on the LMC =D.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed description on both the object and on the story behind the image, I recommend checking <a href=\"https://astrob.in/362315/0/\" target=\"_blank\">2018's image of LMC </a> \r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, comments and suggestions are more than welcome in the comments section. Thank you for taking your time to look at this image!\r\n\r\nDates: 12/08/2018 and 16/11/2019\r\nLocations: MG, Brazil. Rural Skies (Bortle 3-4, calculated SQM ~21.6)\r\nCamera: Canon EOS T5/1200D (mod) at ISO 800 \r\nOptics: Samyang 135mm f/2 operated at f/2.4\r\nMount: Sky-Watcher HEQ5, tracking, guided\r\nExposure Detail: 3 frame mosaic (1x2 base + deep central region). 6x180s + 10x180s + 25x120s.
