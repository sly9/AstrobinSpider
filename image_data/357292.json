Glad to be part of this community with all that great astrophotographers! :-)\r\n\r\nThis black and white version of the Eagle Nebula was a bit tricky because of a very low moon which disturbed the guiding cam working properlyâ€¦ Five minutes later my guiding scope had a new 30cm long dewshield which helped a lot. :-)",
