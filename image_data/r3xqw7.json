    "description": "How long did I have to wait to finally go on the hunt for supernovae again.\r\nAfter 6 weeks of continuous clouds here it was finally time again.\r\nOf course I chose a nice, bright example, which is now visible in the south.\r\nAnd although the SN was already discovered in early October it is still quite bright. Much brighter than I expected.\r\n\r\nEven though the host galaxy doesn't give much, the SN is a worthwhile target even for small optics.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it was only time for 37 subs due to upcoming fog.\r\nThe image is a strong crop.",
