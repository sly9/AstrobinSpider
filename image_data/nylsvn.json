    "description": "A target that has alluded me as a northern hemisphere resident for quite some time. Another one of the many beautiful targets of the south that we seem to miss out on. \r\n\r\nThis one in particular is also quite dim, especially in the Ha. Had a ton of fun bringing out those wavelengths specifically however since they mostly go overlooked due to the amazing structures in the Oiii. \r\n\r\nBlending RGB stars in was a pain, but that is nothing new ;)\r\n\r\nClear skies!",
