    "description": "This image is comprised of around 10 hours of narrowband data, roughly evenly split among S2, H-alpha and O3 channels, during four Feb-2021 nights. Seeing conditions were good to excellent, which shows in the fine details. Still have to correct a horizontal spike-like artifact on the stars in the S2 channel, which I attribute to the camera microlenses (or possibly a spider web in the lens hood). Taken with a QHY 600, and an AP167 fluorite refractor. Make sure to view in full resolution, there are many beautiful corners that get lost in the grand busy scene.",
