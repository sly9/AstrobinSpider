    "description": "A familiar area that I had imaged quite a while ago with a OSC - I wanted to come back and do a narrowband image of it. In this case I ran only HÎ± and OIII filters for the NB data, with a larger number of frames collected for OIII. The stars are RGB from 23 minutes of data for each channel. I ended up with a fair number of hours of data that gave me some clean masters that were easier to work with. As a result, the processing was pretty straightforward, although I did go down the usual rabbit hole playing with different mixes - but that is the fun part :)\n\nI used a new mixing technique I saw in a wonderful tutorial at www.thecoldestnights.com, a wonderful site with impressive astro images and some informative tutorials, including one covering 'Dynamic narrowband combinations with PixelMath' exposing an approach for weighting the channels that I had not seen before.  Check out that site - truly impressive astrophotography there, as well as some very well written tutorials on a couple of topics.",
