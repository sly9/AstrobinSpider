    "description": "Finally, I managed to complete a deep sky project. This is a really spectacular star forming region in Cassiopeia, situated at 7500 ly away from us, in the Perseus spiral arm of the Milky Way. Shot in SHO palette with RGB stars.\r\n\r\nThis was one tough project... I started the acquisitions in September, taking advantage of some clear nights. I noticed weird shapes around the stars, fuzzy half-contours and sometimes some weird bright tails, especially around the bright stars. Looked like reflections and the subs were not equally bad, sometimes the shapes were pretty round. Never had that before. I started shooting the Ha close to the full moon, so I told myself it will get better when the Moon goes away. Same problem. So I finally did what had already planned before, moved the primary mirror further down the tube and raised the focuser in order avoid the protrusion of the Coma Corrector inside the tube. Same effect... I started thinking that I'll throw away the scope and never touch a Newtonian again. And in the end I had an epiphany : since the ONTC is open in the rear and there is some space around the primary, I used to put a black cloth around the rear end, sock-like. This cloth is not velvet, is made of synthetic material and it has some reflections in spite of being black... So that was the simplest solution to this head ache, just took it off and the scope started working like before. \r\n\r\nIn the end I had to throw 40 hours of data, even the round stars had some small haziness around the edges. Back to the drawing board and here is the result, I had to start it all from scratch. Hope you like it.",
