    "description": "Last night (31st August) on a night of good seeing I made successive captures of Jupiter and Saturn in the usual manner. The captures were at 11:23UT and 12:38UT respectively.\r\nThe apparent diameter of both planets is on the wane now they are past opposition and although Jupiter is further past opposition than Saturn, its apparent diameter of nearly 39\" is still more than twice that of the planetary disk of Saturn at ~ 18\". Of course the vast extent of the Saturn's rings makes the apparent size of the planetary system approach that of Jupiter.\r\nThey are presented here to relative scale as seen through the eyepiece or on the camera's sensor.\r\nI wonder if the sandy coloured appearance of Jupiters Equatorial Zone (EZ) is starting to revert back towards the more normal white colour as produced by clouds of ammonia. I am also intrigued by the greenish hue of some the circles/ storms in the Southeast Tropical Zone (STrZ). You may be able to just discern the GRS swinging into view on the western limb as the Oval BA disappears on the other limb.\r\nSaturn is relatively featureless at the moment, but some subtle activity can be seen.",
