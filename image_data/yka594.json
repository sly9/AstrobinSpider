    "description": "Started this image back in the winter of 2019. Ended up with Luminance data only. Managed to capture RGB in March 2020, just right after pandemic has started. Overall, very happy with final result. Couldn't get stars smaller due to bad artefacts showing up every time I tried to dim them, that was caused by my SX694 camera antiblooming problems. I'm sure there is a way to deal with stars in PS, but I don't know how :). I'm PI guy :)",
