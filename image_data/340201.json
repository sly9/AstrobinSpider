    "description": "Quick image of the moon, had some decent seeing but sadly the plans to make a mosaic were shot down by clouds. Decided to instead compare the results of the ASI120MC with my 7D Mark II. It wasn't very fair, and lets just say one was blown out the water. Amazing what a little $150 camera can do compared to a camera that cost 10x as much. Just goes to show that you need the right tool, not always the most expensive one.",
