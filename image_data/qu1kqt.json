    "description": "Well after long interlude finally finish big Cygnus mosaic. I think maybe a bit ambitious for my skill level and computing equipment I have but was fun process and learned some new things to do and some not to do (note to all - leave plenty of overlap between plates).\r\n\r\nI think but am not 100% sure this is joined properly, used MSFT ICE. 4 x300 seconds in Ha each plate.",
