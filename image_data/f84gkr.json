    "description": "This sunspot group rumbled across the face of the Sun all last week. I got one final peek at it on Saturday as it rounded the corner and turned out of view.\r\n\r\nThese active regions are a result of the twisted magnetic field interacting with the hydrogen plasma. That interaction is visible as these plasma “fingers” point every-which-way like a matted nuclear shag rug.\r\n\r\nAfter a long hiatus, I’m back to shooting the the big ball of energy that is our local star. It’s great to have such a dynamic target. The Sun will become even more photogenic as we move into the new solar cycle of activity.",
