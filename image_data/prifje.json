    "description": "Tidal Pool, another name for a Lagoon. Given all of the \"waves\" throughout the image and the numerous rich blue stars; Tidal Pool felt like a fitting image name.\r\n\r\nThis is a much tighter crop of a recent image and one that we felt stood on its own two feet. Some slight tweaks have been made to better show this region compared to the original wider view which can be found in the link below.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/f10x8f/\r\n\r\nWe are happy with the level of detail that can be obtained with a purely RGB image where as most renditions have considerable amounts of Ha blended in to the luminance. Adding Ha does increase the perceived contrast but it's biggest draw back is that it typically flattens the image and there is a lost of overall nebulosity feel. There is a lot of OIII emission that is suppressed when Ha is blended in so a pure RGB image, although having less perceived contrast, has a considerably better rendition of the interplay between Ha and OIII.",
