    "description": "I have here tried to make a softer version of the M33. It is so different from the previous version that I post it separately. This is data I processed from John R Taylor(Sevenoaks, Kent, UK) who kindly put it up on Stargazers Lounge for anyone to have a go at processing. The data in total adds up to about 22 hours of imaging with a 6\"RC and Atik 460ex, LRGB filters. This is what I ended up with. Much fun while skies are gray so thank you John!",
