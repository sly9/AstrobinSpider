    "description": "Due to a lack of data over recent days because of the weather, I decided to try and process the kindly provided free data from Astrobin's data pool. The wonderful data for this, in fact some of the best data I have ever used, was provided by epicycle - it really was a joy to process. It is found at https://www.astrobin.com/rawdata/publicdatapools/58/\r\n\r\n\r\nEpicycle provided the master files for Ha and OIII (registered and calibrated). The total exposure time was 17.3 hours. I used the standard formula for this in Pixelmaths.",
