    "description": "The Heart of the Heart -  Melotte 15 at the center of IC 1805.\r\nLast image from 2017\r\nThe Heart Nebula (IC 1805) is an emission nebula located at an approximate distance of 7,500 light years from Earth, in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is also known as Sharpless 2-190 (Sh2-190).\r\nThe nebula’s glow comes from the radiation of a small open cluster of stars known as Melotte 15. The cluster contains very young, blue, hot supergiant stars about 1.5 million years old. It is located near the nebula’s centre and home to several bright stars with a mass almost 50 times that of the Sun, as well as many faint stars far less massive than the Sun. Melotte 15 once contained a microquasar, a radio emitting X-ray binary system, but the system was expelled from the cluster millions of years ago.\r\nOn the upper-right we can also localize the open cluster C0225+615.",
