    "description": "NGC 5907 is the protagonist of this image, it is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Draco, it is approximately 40 million light years away, in the present image and in the absence of deeper data we can see an extremely thin disk in the upper part of it, this is due to interactions with neighboring galaxies, which also causes some deformation in the galaxy, due to this it has been called the Splinter Galaxy.\r\n\r\nJust to the left of NGC 5907 we find two beautiful galaxies, NGC 5905 (bottom) and NGC 5908, which lie about 140 million light-years away in the northern constellation of Draco. From our perspective we look at NGC 5905 head-on, this is clearly a barred spiral galaxy. On the other hand and despite being also a spiral galaxy, NGC 5908 is revealed by a bright nucleus and that dark band of dust characteristic of the disk of a spiral galaxy.",
