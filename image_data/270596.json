    "description": "NGC 7023 - the Iris Nebula.  18.75 hours of data captured at Olly Penrice's place at Les Granges.  Olly was on hand to provide processing tips and tricks too.  Data captured over 3 successive nights.\r\n\r\nRevision B: Corrected a colour space error in the earlier version.\r\n\r\nRevision C: The 'fix' for revision B did not work as well as I'd hoped so I went back to the unstretched stacks and made sure they remained in sRGB.  I also worked a bit more on some of the stars.  I think my background is a better in this and, as a result, I think I can see a little more of the faint stuff.  But I would appreciate any comments.\r\n\r\nRevision D: Final tweaks as a result of comments made by Barry Wilson",
