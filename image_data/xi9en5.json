    "description": "M82.  This was a fun one to shoot and process.  As I started my third year of AP I decided that in order to improve my results I needed to spend more time acquiring data on each target, which for a traveler like me hauling a good sized setup is not easy.  The data used here was shot on four trips to different dark sites, but I think the effort was worth it.  The deeper stacks are definitely easier to work with and get a clean result.  I also experimented with some new to me processing techniques.  Thanks for looking.",
