    "description": "M81 and M82\r\n\r\nThe M81 and M82 galaxies are a pair of galaxies located in the constellation, Ursa Major. M81 (Bode’s Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy that lies approximately 11.8 million light-years away, while M82 (The Cigar Galaxy) is an irregular galaxy at roughly the same distance away from Earth.  M81 and M82 are best seen during the spring. The image shows M81 (Lower) and M82 (Upper)\r\n\r\nThe apparent separation of the galaxies is 31 arc-minutes but at a distance of 12 million light-years, their actual distances from each other is 150,000 light years. They are the largest members of the M81 Group, a physical association of of 34 galaxies.\r\n\r\nThese galaxies have a gravitational lock on each other and have affected the shape and composition of one another. Between M81 and M82, you’ll find the Integrated Flux Nebula, but this is extremely faint and difficult to photograph. Bode’s Galaxy and the Cigar Galaxy are members of the M81 Group of galaxies.  \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy.",
