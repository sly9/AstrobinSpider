    "description": "This one was a hard nut to crack. I wanted to see the fainter spiral arms on the pic. Not so easy under my nightsky light pollution. But in the last weeks we had some very clear nights and I waited to capture the luminance images until this part reaches the most dark region in my sky in the northwest short before dawn. This I did over 4 nights. For color I used bin 2x2 which I exposed always before the luminance shots. Than of course a lot of processing work to get out the fainter parts. The CLS/CCD filter helps for contrast, but I think I am loosing so fainter stars with it. With the UV/IR filter the backround gets to bright. Red and  blue was quite ok but green is always difficult under my conditions. I think, I can not achieve more deepness with more integration time any more.....hope you like it like it is.\r\nCS to you all\r\n\r\nI put this image from the staging into the public area and can not set any technical data.
