    "description": "When I started this project, I did not realize that I was about to bite off more than I might be able to chew: Boy, these are really faint objects!\r\n\r\nSoon after i started to collect data, I feared that I would never be able to finish this: There was not even a trace of OU4 visible after stacking. So I traveled some 400 km to a really dark spot (20 minute subs at f/2 possible there), this did the trick. Most of data collection was done with a dual setup, a second Samyang lens was provided by my friend Wolfgang.\r\n\r\nData processing was challenging, to put it mildly. This is the result.",
