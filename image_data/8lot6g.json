    "description": "This image was made with a very inexpensive homemade camera, with a PVC tube, a pinhole and a piece of black / white photosensitive paper (the one used inside the darkroom). The camera was fixed to the fireplace of my home, leaving it from the winter solstice to the summer solstice. The photo was awarded as APOD on June 27, 2019.(https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190627.html)                   Ps: Today is my 20th birthday,, I'm going to madea solargraphy for 10 years of continuous exposure ,until my 30th birthday :-)",
