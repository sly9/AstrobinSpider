    "description": "MWP-1 is an old, rather faint planetary nebulae in Cygnus that doesn't seem to be imaged often despite its size, unique and interesting structure and good placement in the sky for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere. Maybe because it's annoyingly difficult to process due to the background hydrogen and oxygen? I really had trouble bringing the latter out without leaving the image \"blotchy\". I also had a harder than usual time integrating the RGB stars. I think it came out pretty well though overall. \r\n\r\nWe're in the middle of what's currently the seventh rainiest year on record in Philadelphia - here's hoping this ends soon. I'd really like to publish more than one image a month...",
