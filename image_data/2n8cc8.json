    "description": "Another great area of contrast in Vulpecula.  How wonderful that these can be imaged during twilight and still achieve beautiful contrast between the starry background and the obscuring dust in the LDN objects.\nLDN 807 is the darkest of the dark nebulae but there are several.  Check the annotated image and the LRGB wide field version for some NGC, Sharpless and PGC galaxies.\nTaken over a couple of nights using Voyager Array.  Colour from the ASI2600MC using the smaller Stowaway and L from the Moravian G4 using the 6\" StarFire EDF.",
