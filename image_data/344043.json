    "description": "This was 100% imaged from my backyard in red zone. I was testing various ways of trying to cut out light pollution and found that taking only RGB subs at 120 seconds or less (lens stopped down to f/4) could get me where I wanted to go. By the time I finished this in the fall, I was over 600 subs deep and hit a point of deminishing return. I stacked all three channels to make a master  luminance copy to layer over the RGB data. In the end it turned out good (not as good as dark skies, but still pretty good).  So the moral of the story is this: buy a bigger hard drive if you shoot broadband targets from the city.",
