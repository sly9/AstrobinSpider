    "description": "Subject: The Rosette Nebula (NGC-2237), an emission nebula in Monoceros, approximately 130 light-years across and 5000 light-years distant. X-ray imaging has revealed around 2500 young stars forming in the nebula's gasses and molecular clouds.\r\n\r\nCapture notes: In what must be a first, Seattle had clear skies, a new moon and steady air on the night of the winter solstice. It was magical. Used the 3nm O-iii filter for the first time that night and am pleased with the results (versus the 5nm). A few nights later when I captured the Ha, it started clear but as the night progressed, thin high clouds started forming and thickening. I was still getting signal when I called it, but not much. Am happy the Ha turned out as well as it did.\r\n\r\nProcessing: Tonemapping of the Ha and O-iii stacks, luminance from the Ha stack with the O-iii tone map added in. Palette is basically HOO, but I boosted the Ha and O-iii data a bit for the red and blue channels, and the green has a little bit (20%) of Ha in the mix.",
