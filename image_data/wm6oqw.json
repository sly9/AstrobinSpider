    "description": "This image comes from a mosaic, which is not finished yet, but I want to take advantage of two of its panels to capture this view of this galactic trio.\r\n\r\nThe Andromeda Galaxy, also known as M31 or NGC 224, is a giant spiral galaxy, with a diameter of two hundred and twenty thousand light years and containing approximately one trillion stars. It is the farthest object visible to the naked eye from Earth.\r\n\r\nM32 is a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). This small galaxy is a prototype of an elliptical galaxy, although in you it appears to be compact compared to other galaxies of the same type.\r\n\r\nM110 is another galaxy that, like M32, is gravitationally tied to M31. Like M32, M110 is also an elliptical-type galaxy.\r\n\r\nThese three galaxies are located at an average distance of 2.5 million light years, in the constellation Andromeda.\r\n\r\nIt has been acquired from the remote observatory Deep Sky West in Rowe New Mexico, where my dear friends and fellow fans Jim Y Linda Powell has hosted her great team.\r\n\r\nThank you very much, dear friends.",
