    "description": "This is another image captured with a widefield setup at the Great Lakes Star Gaze 2017 in Gladwin, MI.   It only took me 2 months to get around to processing it!   \r\n\r\nI always wanted to frame this constellation like this.  I just think its an awesome sight to see Andromeda hovering over the plane of our galaxy, knowing we are both hurtling toward our future collision.    This area of the Milky Way is dotted with some interesting targets.   The brighter ones are the Heart Nebula in the lower right, the Double Cluster slightly above that, and the Pacman Nebula just below the center of the frame.   Of course, the Great Andromeda Galaxy steals the show,  but the rift of the Milky Way makes for an interesting horizon line.   \r\n\r\nThe image was shot unguided with an unmodded Canon 6D through a Nifty Fifty at f/7.1 and ISO@3200.   70x90s subs were used for the total integration.   Though the original drizzled result was over 70 megapixels, I reduced it to 33% to get through some of the background issues (due to not guiding and dithering).   As I did with my Orion image, I shot a handful of frames through a diffusion filter to bring out the bright stars.   I then layered that on top of the integrated stack.",
