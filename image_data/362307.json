    "description": "From August 5th through August 15th we were very fortunate to experience extremely steady, clear and dark skies in Julian, CA. This is the sixth of 6 objects I captured during this time.\r\n\r\nCollimation was off for this one, so resolution could be better.\r\n\r\n\"The Hercules Cluster (Abell 2151) is a cluster of about 200 galaxies some 500 million light-years distant in the constellation Hercules. It is rich in spiral galaxies and shows many interacting galaxies. The cluster is part of the larger Hercules Supercluster, which is itself part of the much larger Great Wall super-structure.\"",
