    "description": "This is my moon-time image.  I am working on dark nebula targets and once moon is up,  a nice narrowband target was needed ;) . This region  has a lot of interesting objects in this field - The Cone Nebula, Christmas Tree Cluster, Fox Fur Nebula and more interestingly the bright and tiny Hubble's Variable Nebula.\r\n  I keep wanting to do the animation showing variability of the the Hubble's variable nebula but now I am without a long FL scope. so that will have wait.\r\n\r\nI was hoping to keep collecting more data on this target but I had bit of a issue on the system  with the focuser's clutch going loose which required a trip out to the observatory. So this has to do. \r\n\r\nProcessed in PI and Photoshop .\r\nHa - 17x15 minutes\r\nOIII - 12x15 minutes\r\nSII - 12x15 minutes",
