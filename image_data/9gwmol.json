    "description": "This is the sum of many images acquired over several years, mainly with telephoto lenses and small refractors.\r\nIt is also part of a larger mosaic covering the entire 400 kpc region around M31. Of course, this image does not have \"aesthetic\" purposes but only for study.\r\nAbout ultra-deep imaging, I suggest the reading of this scientific paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05746.pdf\r\n\r\nThis image offers a good overview of the main structures on the disc and the external halo of Andromeda (M31).\r\nThe disc appears quite regular and there is an abundant presence of young stars, gases and abundant dusts. The bulge is dominated by an older population. The external halo presents various irregularities and thickenings that we can consider as vestiges of dwarf galaxies incorporated progressively by the greater galaxy, as foreseen by the growth models.\r\nM31 is thought to have assimilated a few hundred small galaxies or globular clusters.\r\nThis process is still ongoing.\r\n\r\nScientific data are available on request for serious galactic archeology studies.\r\nSee also: https://www.astrobin.com/pt21d1/",
