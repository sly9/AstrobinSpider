    "description": "Hi,\r\nSomewhere in the forest, looking for a small clearing so that I can take a quick panorama from a tripod, before the moon rises and illuminates the Podlasie sky ... Creaking snow under my feet, temperature - 12 Â° C it is, not to mention a lot of snow in the Podlasie lowlands, it was probably 40 cm! This is how I spent the last day of January, looking for Orion the hunter in the sky as he climbed up! On the right, we see the planet Mars accompanying the winter Milky Way this year! \r\n\r\nPanorama\r\n20 x 15 s ISO3200 @f1.8 \r\nCanon EOS R mod plus Sigma 28mm f1.4 ART\r\n31.01.2021\r\nSiemiony, POLAND",
