    "description": "The  red emission nebula in the center is Sharpless 150 - it is also known as LBN 520.  Sharpless 150  is ionized by two stars - HD 213087 and HD 213405 - the largest bright blue stars on the right.  The faint blue reflection nebula above Sharpless 150 is vdB154 (also known as LBN 523). Another Sharpless object (Sh2-145) is partially in this field in the lower right. There are several dark nebulae in this field - LDB 1206, 1207, 1208, 1209, 1214. There is a small galactic nebula (RNO 142) just to the right of Sharpless 150.  These objects  and some of the brighter stars are identified in the <a href=\"http://www.jthommes.com/Astro/images/SH2-150_FSQ_PS2_annotated.jpg\">annotated image</a>.  Horizontal FOV is approximately 120 arc minutes. Full size image scale is 2.77 arcsec/pix.",
