    "description": "Apod....Apod...Apod guys!\r\n\r\nIm really crying!\r\n\r\nhttps://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190603.html\r\n\r\nHI guys, how are you doing today!? Hope you are fine !! So, I think I tried to put all my efforts in this classical Hubble image processing attempt...three cloudy nights of processing...hope you enjoy  :-)\r\n\r\nThe Hubble Official page for this image could be seen here: https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic0910i/\r\n\r\nMy best regards to all good friends of Astrobin !!! \r\n\r\nA little bit of description extracted from the HST page:\r\n\r\nGalactic Wreckage in Stephans Quintet\r\n\r\n\"A clash among members of a famous galaxy quintet reveals an assortment of stars across a wide colour range, from young, blue stars to aging, red stars.\r\n\r\nThis portrait of Stephan's Quintet, also known as the Hickson Compact Group 92, was taken by the new Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) aboard the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. Stephan's Quintet, as the name implies, is a group of five galaxies. The name, however, is a bit of a misnomer. Studies have shown that group member NGC 7320, at upper left, is actually a foreground galaxy that is about seven times closer to Earth than the rest of the group.\r\n\r\nThree of the galaxies have distorted shapes, elongated spiral arms, and long, gaseous tidal tails containing myriad star clusters, proof of their close encounters. These interactions have sparked a frenzy of star birth in the central pair of galaxies. This drama is being played out against a rich backdrop of faraway galaxies.\r\n\r\nThe image, taken in visible and near-infrared light, showcases WFC3's broad wavelength range. The colours trace the ages of the stellar populations, showing that star birth occurred at different epochs, stretching over hundreds of millions of years. The camera's infrared vision also peers through curtains of dust to see groupings of stars that cannot be seen in visible light.\"",
