    "description": "I made this animation to make it easier to see the subtle features on Saturn's disk. From the 7 RGB runs I made, I produced 3 reasonably good quality captures 10 mins apart. This reversing animation shows the rotation of subtle features on the planet. \r\nDespite the poor quality of the GIF animations I hope you can see these details.",
