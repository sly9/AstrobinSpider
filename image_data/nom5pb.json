    "description": "This is my first completed image for 2021. Clear nights are few and far in between here in Michigan during the winter months. I have always wanted to frame these two together. I also wanted to see how much background Ha I could resolve piling on the integration time and going deep on the processing. \r\n\r\nThe Flaming Star Nebula (IC405 on the left), located in the constellation Auriga, is illuminated by the bright variable star AE Aurigae and about 1500 light years away.\r\n\r\nThe Tadpole Nebula (IC 410 on the lower right) appears to be right next to IC405, but is in fact 12,000 light years away, and much larger (100 light years across).",
