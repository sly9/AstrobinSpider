    "description": "M45\r\nCredit: Giuseppe Donatiello\r\n\r\nBased on images taken with ED 127 f/9 + 0.55x + Canon EOS 4000D + Tair-3S 300mm f/4.5 and Pentacon 200mm f/4.0 lenses combining also old Kodak E200 digitized slides.\r\n\r\nRA 3h 47m Dec +24° 07′\r\nThe Pleiades or Seven Sisters (Messier 45 or M45), is an open star cluster containing middle-aged, hot B-type stars located in the constellation of Taurus. It is among the nearest star clusters to Earth and is the cluster most obvious to the naked eye in the night sky.\r\nThe distance to the Pleiades can be used as an important first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder.\r\nMore recent results using the Gaia satellite (September 2016), determine distances of 134 ±6 pc.\r\nDust that forms a faint reflection nebulosity around the brightest stars was thought at first to be left over from the formation of the cluster, but is now known to be an unrelated dust cloud in the interstellar medium, through which the stars are currently passing.",
