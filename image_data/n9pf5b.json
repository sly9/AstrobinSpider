    "description": "This image was derived from a single RGB run an IR run each side. The seeing was great but fell away so rapidly, that I could only use this first run. Nevertheless the resolution is very good.\r\nNote the polar cap is offset from the rotational axis of the planet. This asymmetry is normal for the cap in the southern summer.\r\nI have had it confirmed to me by Richard McKim, the BAA Director for Mars, that the most likely explanation for the linear white feature over the southern most of the Tharsis shield volcanoes is that it is the Arsia Mons Elongated Cloud (AMEC). Use the mouse-over for a detailed image of the feature and to see the location on Mars.",
