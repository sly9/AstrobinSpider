    "description": "This was a surprise capture. After the neighbor's light made certain I couldn't continue on my other target, I looked in my sky app to see what was coming up. I saw this was going to be happening and the Trifid would be at 14 degrees at 4:00AM, so I had a cup of coffee and imaged what I could before the sun came up.\r\n\r\nI didn't expect the movement of Mars to be so much and it can certainly be seen here in this full image of 1 hour 53 minutes. \r\n\r\nRevision B is a GIF showing the movement over 110 minutes. For the animation I did 11 ten minute stacks to get some detail in the area and also keep Mars somewhat round without trailing.",
