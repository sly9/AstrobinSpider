    "description": "A long and deep look at this intriguing interacting trio of galaxies.  It had been a long-held ambition to image the complete extended tidal tail of NGC3628, Hamburger or Sarah's Galaxy and I'm pleased to say that our (Steve & I) plan worked although I can confirm that the tidal tail doesn't give itself up easily, even with 1200s Luminance subs.  The image is a small crop.\r\n\r\nCaptured between mid-December 2017 and early February 2018.\r\n\r\nData capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
