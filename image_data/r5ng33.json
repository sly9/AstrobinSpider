    "description": "Thinking ahead to Hallowe'en, I framed this part of the Veil so as to evoke a terrifying Alien from the well-known movie franchise, and I call the image \"Alien Beyond the Veil\". I used two narrowband filters, and in this colour mapping the redder areas correspond primarily to Ha, and the bluer regions to OIII. \r\n\r\nThis is a two-panel mosaic combining just under 20 hours of subframes (divided roughly equally between the two filters), captured on eight nights in August. I reduced the image size for final presentation by 75%, since collimation and mount tracking on my new system had not yet been fully optimized. The final plate scale is about 0.62\"/pixel, and the angular image size after cropping is about 31' x 55'.",
