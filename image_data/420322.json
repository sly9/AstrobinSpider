    "description": "Saturn on the evening of Thu 1 Aug 2019 UTC.\r\n\r\nI have not imaged Saturn much this year due to Jupiter stealing the show (a very favourable southern apparition). Last week saw some of the best seeing yet this winter and I was glad to swing to Saturn for a change. This view combines 17,487 best frames acquired between 10:30 and 11:31 UTC (8:30 and 9:31 pm Canberra time), a one hour imaging run. Glad to be indoors at the time as the outside temperature hovered around 1 degree Celsius.\r\n\r\nThe North Polar Hexagon is nicely resolved and a number of storms are on view within the belts. A double ripple is prominent on the NEB's southern boundary as is a white spot within the NEB. North Polar Region is again active with a storm rotating into view above the western limb. The rings show nice amount of detail throughout with Encke and Laplace Divisions easily detectable.\r\n\r\nI have derotated 52 individual stacks (2 minute long SERs) to produce this picture.",
