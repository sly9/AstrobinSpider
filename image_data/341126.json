    "description": "Had a version of this image previously from some FSQ-106 data at DSW from about a year ago. This data was definitely a bit better to work with, didn't even need to apply any noise reduction on the L frame, it was just so clean. I could have probably also gotten away with no noise reduction in the RGB, but decided to apply just a little to kill some slight slight chrominance.  Additionally, the older data didn't include the star cluster in the lower left which I think is a very nice addition to image. Revision B shows the three different edits I went through on this data (right most being the final). Was glad I didn't stop after the first revision. There are definitely some slight errors that I would like to fix in future versions. For example, dark structure enhance really hit my orange stars and made them much more orange. This is especially apparent within the reflection nebulae. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
