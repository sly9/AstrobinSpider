    "description": "Today is the 8th anniversary of this image. \r\n\r\nI spent 3 days scouting the Bisti Badlands (New Mexico, USA) to find a nice foreground to photoghraph the annular eclipse of the sun.\r\n\r\nPhotographing just an annular eclipse does not make a pretty picture in my opinion. So, I set out on foot through the bizarre landscape and this particular spot seemed to be the most promising.\r\nUnfortunately, the annual eclipse itself was far too high in the sky for a nice composition. Disappointed, I just waited to see if something could be salvaged from the situation. The image here is the result.\r\nNot the photo of the annular eclipse I had hoped for, but a strange, almost alien setting. I was happy that I waited.\r\n\r\nCanon EOS 5d MkII\r\nSamyang 35mm\r\nBracketed shots, HDR blended",
