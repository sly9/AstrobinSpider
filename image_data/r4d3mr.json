    "description": "Simeis 147, also known as Sharpless 2-240 is a large and extremely faint supernova remnant lying on the border of the Constellations Taurus and Auriga. It is approximately 3000 light years from Earth and covers an area of sky larger than 3x3 degrees. The supernova is estimated to have occurred over 30,000 years ago leaving behind this remnant and a spinning neutron star at its center designated as a pulsar PSR JO538+2817. It was discovered in 1952 in Simeis a then part of the USSR.",
