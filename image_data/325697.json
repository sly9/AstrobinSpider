    "description": "This object is a beautifully textured emission/reflection nebula which spans 5 light years and is located 1500 years away in the constellation of Auriga.  The Flaming Star Nebula is named because of both the reddish and bluish colors surrounding the brightest star, AE Aurigae. The combination of colors give the impression that the star is burning. This bright star ionizes the hydrogen gas around it, emitting red light as a strong emission nebula, and creates light from starlight-reflected dust, emitting blue light as a more subtle reflection nebula.\r\n \r\nThe bright star did not condense from the surrounding nebula, as most do, but is believed to have originated in Orion and is now an ejected runaway star passing through this area.  This star is at the head of a small 4 star kite asterism which has double star at the other end.  The foreground star field in the front of the nebula is dense and colorful.",
