    "description": "NGC 1763, at the center of this image, is a bright and large emission nebula within a group of several emission nebulae and a star cluster in the LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud).  This nebula is actually a cavity, filled with gas and dust that shows dramatic dark dust filaments but very hard to discern in this wide view.\r\n\r\nProcessing Note:\r\nThis image was by far the hardest for me to process, having issues with gradients, light pollution and artifacts.  It took me over 3.5 months to capture around 45 hours of NB data ,some which I had to discard. I never thought I'll spend more time processing this image than imaging it, I'm now over it and happy with the result. I hope you like it\r\n\r\nRevision B:\r\nImproved clarity and corrected color using Photoshop Lightroom",
