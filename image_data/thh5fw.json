    "description": "Sharpless 2-132 is a very faint emission type nebula on the Cepheus/Lacerta border. It lies at a degree southeast of Epsilon Cep and has a size of about 40 arc minutes. It is estimated to be about 10,000 to 12,000 light years away, but this is no more than an estimate. It's a well studied region as well, with lots going on as you can see in the image. It can be glimpsed visually, but that takes a rich-field refractor and very dark skies.\r\n\r\nI originally captured and processed a Hubble Palette version about a year ago. In these cloudy winter months here in Michigan I wanted to try a more natural palette in HOO. The stars are still in SHO but color shifted to a more natural look.",
