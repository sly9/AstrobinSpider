    "description": "The Box, galaxy group Hickson 61 (HCG 61) in the constellation Coma Berenices. \r\nThe bluish spiral at the top is NGC 4173 and the edge-on galaxy next to it is NGC 4175. The smallest galaxy, at the bottom, is NGC 4174 and the last one (an elliptical) is NGC 4169. The bluish NGC 4173 is only about 50 million light years distant while the other three are at a distance of about 180 million light years, indicating that NGC 4169, 4174, and 4175 are likely to be physically related while NGC 4173 is definitely a foreground object.\r\n\r\nThis image taken in May, June 2019.",
