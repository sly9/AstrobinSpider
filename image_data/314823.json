    "description": "Probably, this is the most spectacular object in the night sky. Even in southern hemisphere, which M31 stays near horizon, it is observed at naked eye in dark sites. This amazing object is so huge that takes all field of my telescope.\r\n\r\nIn this capture I had many problems, the RGB was taken in different night from the Luminance, so the alignment was not so well done as I'd like. Besides that, the image is a few noisy and need more exposure time.\r\n\r\nEven so, I liked a lot of the result. I hope you like it! ",
