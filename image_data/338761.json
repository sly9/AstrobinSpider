    "description": "This is my first image of 2018.  I got out in early February and managed to capture this area before it set into the Denver light pollution. IC2177 is on the border between Monoceros and Canis Major.  There are several star clusters, dust clouds, and reflection nebula to go along with the emission region.  Here is my version of the Seagull nebula:\r\n\r\nCanon 6D modified\r\nISO 1600\r\n27 x 300 sec\r\nSV80ST at 480 mm f/6\r\nCEM60",
