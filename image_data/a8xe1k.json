    "description": "The \"Cygnus Wall\" is the Central America region of the greater North American Nebula (NGC 7000), a large region of glowing gas west of Deneb.  My narrowband image rendered in the Hubble palette shows the reflection nebula with dark dust clouds (LDN 935) ominously looming over them.  The dense dust is peppered with variable stars, as annotated in my full image.\r\n\r\nAlthough from a different region, the reflection nebula reminds me of The Three Sisters mountains of Alberta, Canada, on a stormy, rainy day.  I have cropped the full image to better present this to you.  Or, it may just be the effect of the thunderstorm currently raging outside as I process this image :)\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy.",
