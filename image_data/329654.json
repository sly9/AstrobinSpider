    "description": "Bicolor 2-panel mosaic (my first and last?) manually aligned. I messed up my framing of the (basically pointless) O3 in the Flaming Star, so I had to crop out more than I wanted to  - even on the Tadpoles - in order to keep the subject roughly centered. Oh well - I'm still pretty happy with it.\r\n\r\nI did take RGB subs for the stars in both panels, but the data came out pretty strange. There's a slight chance that if I become more familiar with PixInsight, I can use that data to keep from cropping it as tight, but don't bet on it. My first sub for this was taken on November 10, but I had to trash all my early data due to a loose objective on the refractor.",
