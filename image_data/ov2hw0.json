    "description": "This beautiful nebula, RCW 58 surrounds and originates from a special type of star, a Wolf-Rayet star, WR40 (HD 96548, WN8). The nebula is called the annular nebula, because of its open appearance. The nebula is expanding at a speed of 87 km / s. It has an unusual appearance with knots and a radial pattern. It is particularly challenging to process due to the region of the sky very rich in stars.",
