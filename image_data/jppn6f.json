    "description": "After capturing Melotte 15 and the Fishhead, I figured I'd go after this interesting area since it was in the neighborhood. Not completely happy with losing some of the fainter regions and some dodgy stars, but it's a start! I think my initital stretch was a bit low which impacted the rest of the processing. This was also my first attempt at 20 minute exposures with the 3nm filters and I do think it helped a bit.\r\n\r\nCaptured over 17 nights (October: 9, 10, 14, 18, 31) (November: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18) and threw away 18 hours of subs to get clean data.",
