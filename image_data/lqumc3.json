    "description": "Still continuing looking at old data and reprocess while waiting for things to setup in my new observatory. \r\n\r\nThis data is from 2017 shot from my backyard my now-sold Edge11 and ASI1600 combination . The data is not as deep as I would like (5 min narrowband subs at unity gain). The calibration also left some edge artificats that I had to crop. However, the background etc was clear.\r\n\r\nI processed in PI and tried a few different mapping of SHO data to see if I Can get some variation in the channels. It feels like there is a bit more data not resolving here (There is a super faint outcropping that I couldnt get to show up clearly) . I will revisit this again when the observatory is up and running.\r\n\r\nAstrodon Ha 1.25 5nm: 36x300\" bin 1x1\r\nAstrodon OIII 1.25 3nm: 44x300\" bin 1x1\r\nAstrodon SII 1.25 5nm: 45x300\" bin 1x1",
