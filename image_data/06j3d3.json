    "description": "This marks day 3 of my great data upload.  Having focused primarily on Instagram to feature my work, I've fallen months behind  with my Astrobin account (The last time I uploaded anything was right before the server crashed) .  So I have been taking advantage of my free time  away from work and school to  get my account up to date by uploading my favorite images from this past year. Now when you consider that I image about 6 nights a week,  there are A  LOT of them.  I've been trying to drop one a day, however I am finding that many of my photos need some reprocessing.  Anyone photographer who is familiar with IG knows of the horrible image compression.  Restrictions in  resolution, color depth, pixel ratio, and file size led me to process images specifically for IG display.  These \"watered down\" images don't look so great in full resolution, so I am going back and reprocessing many on them.   \r\n\r\nThis image of the Rosette was my first attempt to shoot narrowband with a monochrome camera.   I was blown away with the results and I absolutely fell in love with the Chroma 3nm filters.  They produce such quality images.   Although I enjoy the colors within the The original  version which had a stronger green hue, I decided to try something different and do the dark blue and gold style SHO.",
