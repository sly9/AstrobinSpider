    "description": "Centaurus A, NGC 5128 is a galaxy in the constellation of Centaurus. The Galaxy is a giant elliptical galaxy but is also classed as a peculiar galaxy and is around 16 million light-years from Earth. NGC 5128 has a very high level of radio emissions and is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth, so its active galactic nucleus has been extensively studied by professional astronomers.\nThe center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of 55 million solar masses, which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. In our image you can see a Hydrogen alpha jet at the top right corner. \nImaged in LRGB and H alpha at Obstech, Chile\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\nSystem Control: Voyager by Leo Orazi",
