    "description": "Polar ring/Starburst Galaxy NGC 660\r\n\r\nGalactic collisions  and interactions are fairly common.   NGC 660, a very unique polar-ring galaxy, may be an example of such a collision.  The inner element of the galaxy is tilted 45 degrees from the outer.  It lies 45 million light years away in the constellation Pisces.  The violent interaction of the two colliding galaxies has created what is now considered to be a starburst galaxy, with a multitude of new star forming regions ignited by the tidal (gravitational) interactions within.  There is intense star formation occurring in the core.  I tried to go deeper with this image in order to pick up some more detail in the core and star forming regions.  \r\n\r\nImage Acquisition:\r\nLocation- Starlodge Observatory, Fairview, UT\r\nDate- October 2019\r\nTelescope- AT 16 Ritchey Chretien\r\nCamera- Atik 16200\r\nLRGB- 860:340:360:400,  32 hours",
