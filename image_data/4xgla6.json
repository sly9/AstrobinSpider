    "description": "This is an Ha+OIII+LRGB image (using the LRGB data from <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/he279r\">https://www.astrobin.com/he279r</a>. HALRGB can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/4s2j93/\">https://www.astrobin.com/4s2j93/</a>) showing the diffuse nebula Sh2-129 (The Flying Bat) and the enigmatic, bipolar planetary nebula OU4 (The Squid Nebula).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the 12.7hrs of LRGB data, there is another 16hrs of HA data added into the R channel, using a \"lighten\" method (MAX() function) in PixelMath, and on top of this, 45 hrs (!) of [OIII] (made starless using Starnet++) blended in using a lighten function in Photoshop. The [OIII]ith a selective mask to bring forth the Squid itself and leaving the noisier background out. \r\n\r\nThe scope used is only 80mm in aperture, and I think throwing more aperture at this one is really the only way to improve the [OIII] signal, which was not very strong (understatement!) - OU4 is extremely faint, and I've reached the end I think in what can be pulled out from here, and I feel time to move on (to something brighter!). \r\n\r\nThere is some(...) [OIII] emission corresponding to the main Ha emission regions in SH2-129, but it's so very faint it's barely above the noise floor. (2x2 bin may well have been better here...ho hum)\r\n\r\nThis data was captured from EEYE on our shared rig.\r\n\r\nAcquisition: Graeme Coates & Paul Tribe\r\nProcessing: Paul Tribe",
