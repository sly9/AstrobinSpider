    "description": "The actual first light for my EosR which has been astromodded. This is also a 2-session take. After the first 2h of exposure in the first session I found that this was not enough. Dark thing! So I doubled it (almost) the night after. Still, it wasn't exactly easy to peel SH2-261 out that pink - see the single frame on the right. Plain to see that I couldn't be aware that IC2162 made it into the frame... and I was really astonished what else came to light out of this \"pink soup\" 8) No wonder, it is sitting in the middle of gas and dust regions roughly 3200 LY away and measuring some 26 LY across. \r\n\r\nSH2-261 is also known as Lower's nebula as it was discovered by Harold Lower and his son Charles only in 1939. They found it on a photographic plate exposed by their custom made Schmidt-camera. I guess they didn't see much of it but, they did and that's what counts! ;)",
