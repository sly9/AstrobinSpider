    "description": "NGC 2174, or the Monkey Head nebula, is an emission nebula in Orion located around 6,400 light years from Earth.\r\nI am resist to turn the image 90ยบ to see clearly the head... I really prefer how these clouds creates a better tridimensional effect and how the complete nebula increase his beauty if you are not identifying the \"monkey head\".\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bujklJTt.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" />\r\n\r\nClose to 70 hours of image integration using my dual setup at the remote observatory located in Ager, Spain.",
