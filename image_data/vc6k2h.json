    "description": "The Trifid Nebula was one of the first few objects that I shot.  That image was so poor that it went right into the bit bucket!  I think I've finally got an image of it that I am happy with.  This data was taken from the pristine Chilean skies by the TOA-150 at Deep Sky West - Chile.  It is a mix of Ha, Oiii and LRGB data.",
