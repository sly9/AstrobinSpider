    "description": "Also known as the Needle and Caldwell 38, this galaxy always reminds me of the Milky Way we see in full sky images.  The Spitzer Space Telescope confirmed that is is a barred spiral.  Also of interest, it contains 240 globular clusters - some of which I believe I captured but are lost in my decision to increase contrast.  I'd like to see if I can locate a map of those and compare it to a more aggressive stretch.\r\n\r\nAfter some difficult projects this galaxy season, 4565 was a welcome relief!  This is pretty easy to process given a lack of dim extended areas or an overly bright core.  Whew!  Now back to M63....",
