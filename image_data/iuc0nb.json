    "description": "The M94 Croc's Eye Galaxy. Luminance is captured in both 60s exposures and 180s exposures and combined using HDRComposition in PixInsight. This allowed for quite some detail to remain visible in the heart of the galaxy, while still having a decent visibility of the nebulosity surrounding the galaxy, giving it the characteristic look of an eye.",
