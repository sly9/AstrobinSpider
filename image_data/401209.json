    "description": "NGC 4236.\r\n\r\nUnfortunate some stars got messed up a bit, I was playing around with the gain and that probably was not such a wise idea...\r\n\r\nI also heard about collecting the blue light near the meridian, I almost have a new data set complete for M 101 and on that set I collected the blue light only near the meridian. Curious to see what that will do... Blue light is the hardest to get right.\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting point is that this image has been taken with no moon. And I still prefer my previous image which was taking with a full moon (close to 100%).  I know that humidity has a lot to do with it as well when the moon is there, but I will just keep collecting data even if the moon is there.",
