    "description": "I was never able to process this data to my satisfaction.  I always ended up over processing the image into a cartoon.  Its a difficult subject to process if one wants to portray the myriad dark structures and other details of the ridge lines and slopes.  This image is really an entirely different image than the one I created three years ago, hence its own posting.  One thing I did was inspect the Ha subs and found several that were poor, which brought the clarity and sharpness of the data way down.  I think I am off to a better start\r\n\r\nThis is a HaSHO composition, with Ha being used for the green channel as well as a luminance.",
