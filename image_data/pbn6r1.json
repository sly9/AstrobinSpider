    "description": "804 Hispania is a minor planet orbiting the Sun. It was discovered from Barcelona (Spain) on 20 March 1915 by Josep Comas Solá (1868–1937), the first asteroid to be discovered by a Spaniard.\r\n\r\nHispania is a carbonaceous C-type asteroid and has a diameter of 122 kilometers according to measurements made with the W. M. Keck Observatory. This is 30% smaller than the size estimated from the IRAS observatory data. It has a size ratio of 1.16 between its major and minor axes.\r\n\r\n804 Hispania was identified using the online NEOCMTChecker. At the time the data was collected, it was a Mag 12.4 object.\r\n\r\nI saw the second object moving in the image and was able to ID it using the same database. It's not as impressive as Hispania, but still worth noting.  It's 1302 Werra. Here is the description.\r\n\r\n1302 Werra, provisional designation 1924 SV, is a Themistian asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 30 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 28 September 1924, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory.",
