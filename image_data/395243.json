    "description": "28,000,000 light Years Distant!\r\nThis amazing galaxy has long been on my bucket list.\r\n\r\nLooks like a UFO being chased by stormtroopers  – “Pew Pew Pew”, as the three stars to the upper right look like laser bursts… well to me anyway!\r\n\r\nM104 from dark site in Country Victoria, Australia.\r\n5 hrs LUM & RGB Data in 3-5 min subs\r\n\r\nProcessed using Astro Pixel Processor & Photoshop CC 2019\r\n\r\nThe striking spiral galaxy M104 is famous for its nearly edge-on profile featuring a broad ring of obscuring dust lanes. Seen in silhouette against an extensive bulge of stars, the swath of cosmic dust lends a broad brimmed hat-like appearance to the galaxy suggesting the more popular moniker, The Sombrero Galaxy.  \r\n\r\nM104 has a bright central bulge when viewed with ground-based instruments. Also known as NGC 4594, the Sombrero galaxy can be seen across the spectrum and is thought to host a central supermassive black hole. About 50,000 light-years across and 28 million light-years away, M104 is one of the largest galaxies at the southern edge of the Virgo Galaxy Cluster. (text >Apod)",
