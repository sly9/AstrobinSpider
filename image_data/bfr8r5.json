    "description": "This was first light with my (new to me but used) RC8;  it was in desperate need of cleaning and then a collimation and I had NO idea how. AFTER a few attempts and a lot of HELP from Dean at STARIZONA and then shipping to him (from Indiana) and a small readjustment when i got it back I had a new scope practically.\r\n\r\nI set my eyes on something with some start spikes and thought this would be a great target.  ALBEIT very very faint and I'm in a Bortle 6.\r\n\r\nThis is a little over 11 hours and does need more but I am pretty happy with results.  Such a soft and subtle target.  The HA integration was a bit of a challenge and more time would bring out the lovely dust",
