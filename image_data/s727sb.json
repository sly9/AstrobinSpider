    "description": "I have been working on becoming more familiar with Milky Way Photography.  This is an image of my observatory in my back yard and is one of my first attempts.  Took one foreground image of 4 minutes, and 5 four minute sky images at F 2.8 and ISO 800.  Used the MSM tracking mount and stacked the images using Sequator.  These were taken between 3AM and 4 AM.  The sky glow is from Phoenix, which is roughly 90 miles Southeast from my location.",
