    "description": "IC 5146 (also Caldwell 19, Sh 2-125, and the Cocoon Nebula) is combination of reflection and emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus. The nebula is about 4,000 ly away, and the central star that lights it formed about 100,000 years ago; the nebula is about 12 arcmins across, which is equivalent to a span of 15 light years.\r\n\r\nIC 5146 is a stellar nursery where star-formation is ongoing. Observations by both the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory have collectively identified hundreds of young stellar objects. Young stars are seen in both the emission nebula, where gas has been ionized by massive young stars, and in the infrared-dark molecular cloud that forms the \"tail\". The most-massive stars in the region is BD +46 3474, a star of class B1 that is an estimated 14Â±4 times the mass of the sun.\r\n(c) Wikipedia",
