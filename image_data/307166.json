    "description": "\r\nGot back from road trip to west Texas and Finally had a chance to shoot summer milkyway. I have been looking forward to shooting it for quite sometime.\r\n\r\nThis was shot with a 50mm Nikon @f.8 and Nikon D750 unmodified camera on an iOptron Skytracker. This is about 12x30sec shot from Big Bend National Park (Chisos Mountain lodge)\r\n\r\nIt was looking like it would be cloudy and it cleared up just enough to shoot (and before a 90% illuminated moon rose fairly early)\r\n\r\nThis is the Milkyway Core and the interesting Antares/Rho Ophiuchi region on the right of the frame).\r\n\r\nQuite happy with how it turned out (though at F1.8 this lens has quite a bit of aberration in the edges).\r\n",
