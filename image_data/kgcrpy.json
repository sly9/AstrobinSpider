    "description": "Sharpless-96 (Sh2-96) is part of a giant ancient super nova remnant designated G65.3+5.7 located in the constellation Cygnus the Swan approximately 2500 light-years distant. Even with my short focal length of my Stellarvue SV70T with a reducer, I was still only able to capture part of it. It would require a really short focal length DSLR lens to get the whole super nova structure, which is over four degrees in diameter. This portion, Sh2-96, however is the most interesting part. Other parts include designations of Sh2-91 and Sh2-94, which are out of the field of view. Because of how old and dispersed the gas is, it is very faint. I did not pick up any nebulosity in a single sub, so not many attempt it for obvious reasons. I had to really massage the data to get where I wanted it. It reminds me of CTB-1 (Abell 85) meets the Veil Nebula, which makes sense because they are super nova remnants as well.",
