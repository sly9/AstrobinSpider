    "description": "Messier 81 (also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy about 12 million light-years away, with at diameter of 90,000 light years, about half the size of the Milky Way, in the constellation Ursa Major. Due to its proximity to Earth, large size, and active galactic nucleus (which harbors a 70 million M☉[5] supermassive black hole), Messier 81 has been studied extensively by professional astronomers. The galaxy's large size and relatively high brightness also makes it a popular target for amateur astronomers. :-))))\r\nMessier 81 was first discovered by Johann Elert Bode on December 31, 1774.\r\n Consequently, the galaxy is sometimes referred to as \"Bode's Galaxy\"\r\nWikipédia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 nights despite very high Mistral wind, but nice transparency!\r\n\r\n47 Light subs @180s gain 139 and -20°C and \r\n\r\n16 Blue subs @180s gain 139 and -20°C\r\n14 Green subs @180s gain 139 and -20°C\r\n16 Red subs @180s gain 139 and -20°C",
