    "description": "NGC 1512 is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 38 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Horologium. The galaxy displays a double ring structure, with one ring around the galactic nucleus and another further out in the main disk. The galaxy hosts an extended UV disc with at least 200 clusters with recent star formation activity. NGC 1512 is a member of the Dorado Group.\r\n\r\nGravitational tidal forces of NGC 1512 are influencing nearby dwarf lenticular galaxy NGC 1510 (at the middle right of this image). The two galaxies are separated by only âˆ¼5 arcmin (13.8 kpc), and are in the process of a lengthy merger which has been going on for 400 million years. At the end of this process NGC 1512 will have cannibalised its smaller companion.\r\n\r\nExtracted from Wikipedia",
