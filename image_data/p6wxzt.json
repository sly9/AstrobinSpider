    "description": "I was late  in the season for M78. I could only get 2 hours per clear night to photography this subject.  It's bright enough to  minimize the exposure time.  Spring time in west Texas is not so corporate.  Like people always say, it is clear when the moon is full, cloudy when moon is gone:-) . I love the texture and color of  M78 . \n\nL:  36x600s\nR/G/B: 15x600s",
