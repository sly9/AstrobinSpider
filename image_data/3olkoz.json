    "description": "I wasn't quite sure what to call this one.  NGC6914 is the tiny reflection nebula in the lower center of the image.  But since this is a narrow band image, it isn't really about the reflection nebula since it barely comes through.  For me, this is really about the nebulosity in that area, hence the title.\r\n\r\nI have been playing with colors for my last couple narrow band images.  I left a slight amount of green in this image and played with the hue curve in PixInsight to make the gold a little more rusty and the blue a bit more rich and dark.  I think I like this one the best out of the three, but I welcome your opinions.",
