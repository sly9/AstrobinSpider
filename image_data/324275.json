    "description": "* Image acquisition by Liverpool Telescope (luminance, build with sdss-g filtered) and C. Barbosa (RGB).\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* See also:  <a href=\" https://www.astrobin.com/312980/ \"> NGC 7331</a>. <a href=\"http://astrob.in/312980/0/\"><img src=\"http://astrob.in/312980/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>\r\n\r\nStephan's Quintet is a visual grouping of five galaxies of which four form the first compact galaxy group ever discovered. \r\n\r\nThe brightest member of the visual grouping is NGC 7320 that is shown to have extensive H II regions, identified as red blobs, where active star formation is occurring.\r\nFour of the five galaxies in Stephan's Quintet form a physical association, Hickson Compact Group 92, and will likely merge with each other. Radio observations in the early 1970s revealed a mysterious filament of emission which lies in inter-galactic space between the galaxies in the group. This same region is also detected in the faint glow of ionized atomic hydrogen seen in the visible part of the spectrum as a green arc.",
