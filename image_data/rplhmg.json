    "description": "First of a two-part series that I like to call \"Galaxies that are Too Small for my Telescope\". ðŸ™‚  This is NGC-7741, a barred spiral galaxy about 40M light-years away in Pegasus. Apparently its outer regions extend well beyond what you see, but are very faint. If you look closely, there are 30-40 other galaxies in this field, some edge-on, some face-on spirals, and a few ellipticals. If things get boring this winter, I might try to process some Hubble data on one or two.",
