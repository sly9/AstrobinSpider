    "description": "M97 or the Owl Nebula, one of the only four PNs in the Messier catalog and the most difficult one to image. I started this in 2007 (unguided) and I found this PN surprisingly difficult to image properly despite its brightness. Somehow the noise level seemed to plateau no matter the increase in exposure time. Eventually I made peace with this and issued my first version. Never quite really happy about it in 2010 I decided to up my game and went for higher image scale with longer guided exposures. I also used the UHC filter in the hope of improving the SNR. It didn't turn out any better. Eventually, as of 2020, I re-registered everything in PI at the lower image scale and created the (this) final image. In hindsight I should have gone for H-alpha to complement the UHC exposures, something I came to sorely regret not having done. Too late now, the gate is open and the cows are out.",
