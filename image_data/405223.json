    "description": "First processing of my latest imaging session. I wished i had had better results from the h alpha, but  the 5D does not perform well for h alpha. All in all, happy with the result, althoug I might come back soon to do a more relaxed processing.\r\n\r\nThe initial target was M 63, but had lots of problems finding a valid star through the OAG and I gave up to M 101, for which eventually found a very good guiding star.",
