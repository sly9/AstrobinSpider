    "description": "This galaxy has a striking appearance.  Its thin spiral arms resemble a tightly-wound watch spring. Or a braided rug.  The object has been referred to as the “Hypnotist Galaxy.”   NGC 488 is said to be a multi-armed spiral, but on careful inspection, it seems to me that there are really only two (closely-spaced) arms.\r\n\r\nDistance:  90 million light years\r\nMagnitude:  10.4\r\nSize:  3.9  x 5.4 arc minutes\r\nConstellation:  Pisces",
