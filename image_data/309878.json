    "description": "From St. Joseph, MO.\r\n\r\nClouds were thick with intermittent rain right up to totality, but then the clouds started to break in occasional patches and began intermittently clearing as the sun approached full again.\r\n\r\nAll images shot handheld with a Canon 80D, Canon 70-200 f/2.8 II IS L USM and 2X extender using a Marumi 77mm DHG ND-100000 Solid Neutral Density 5.0 Solar Eclipse Filter.  I had a solid Celestron photographic tripod for mounting the camera, but I kept having to move it under shelter because of rain and at the last minute as clouds began breaking I just had to take the camera off the mount and shoot handheld while going between filter off and filter on and trying to guess at and dial in exposure settings as quickly as possible.  I was unable to get very well focused or optimally exposed images, but found a few on the camera card from which to put together a series of the sun waxing back in.  The first six were behind fairly heavy clouds, and the last four had only thin clouds blowing by so I was able to find a few exposures that weren't completely obscured.\r\n\r\nExposures:\r\nHaphazard mix with or without ND-100000 solar filter (depending on cloud thickness) from 1/30 sec to 1/8000 sec, ISO ranging from 200 to 6400, f/5.6-f/8.",
