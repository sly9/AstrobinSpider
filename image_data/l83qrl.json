    "description": "I love how Bok globules just hang there, suspended in space. They are literally just huge clouds of gas, mainly hydrogen, conglomerating with gravity. These things are way bigger than our solar system, and each cloud potentially makes up many times the mass of our sun. They are easily disturbed by their local stellar winds / gravity, and assume all sorts of bizarre shapes.\r\n\r\nI decided frame them in the center specifically, and to dedicate 20 hours of telescope imaging Integration time. This was broken up over the course of a few weeks as this winter cloud season has been quiet intense.",
