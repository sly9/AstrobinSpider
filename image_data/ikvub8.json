    "description": "Alnitak, The Flame, Horsehead and Orion Nebulae\r\nCredit: Giuseppe Donatiello\r\n\r\nRA: 05h 40m 45.52666s Dec: −01° 56′ 342649″\r\nAlnitak (Zeta Orionis, 50 Ori) is a triple star system at 736 light-years. The primary (Alnitak A) is itself a close binary, comprising Alnitak Aa and Alnitak Ab discovered in 1998. Alnitak B is a B-type star which orbits Alnitak A every 1500 years. A fourth star, Alnitak C, has not been confirmed to be part of the Aa-Ab-B group.\r\nThe Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33) is a dark nebula in Orion. The nebula is located at south of the star Alnitak, on Orion's Belt, as part of the much larger Orion Molecular Cloud Complex.\r\nThe Horsehead Nebula is at 1500 light-years and is one of the most identifiable nebulae.\r\n\r\nRA 05h 35m DEC −05° 23 \r\nPopularly called the Orion Nebula, this stellar nursery is only 1,500 light-years away, making it the closest large star-forming region to Earth.\r\nBecause of its brightness and prominent location just below Orion’s belt, M42 can be spotted with the naked eye under very dark skies.",
