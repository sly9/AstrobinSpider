    "description": "The data aquisition for Messier 94 (Croc’s Eye Galaxy or also Cat's Eye Galaxy) was already done in this years' galaxy-time around March. \r\n\r\nI had a few very clear and dark nights, which had a very positive effect on the image data. During the processing I was very happy to see how well the outer, faint halo of the galaxy appeared. Even very fine parts of emission nebulae (reddish H-Alpha) can be seen in the halo. \r\n\r\nMessier objects are generally very bright, but M94 with all its great details in the core down to its fine extensions surprised me very positively. :-)",
