    "description": "Iris Nebula Widefield in LRGB\r\n\r\nIncludes the region of the Ghost Nebula (vdb141) on the left, and LBN468 with its dusty knots and Herbig-Haro objects on the right. \r\n\r\nImaged at 2x2 binning then drizzle integrated at 2x before cropping and post-processing. Later downscaled to FWHM=3 (from 4.5) pixels in final versions.\r\n\r\nSky brightness SQM 20.51 with minor occasional smoke and haze.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate: I decided about a week after posting this photo repeat the imaging of this region, instead with my RASA.  It produced the better result: https://www.astrobin.com/v30sgb/",
