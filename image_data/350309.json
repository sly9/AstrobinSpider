    "description": "IC 1396, The Elephant Trunk Nebula, this is my first long integration with the new camera. It’s also my first attempt at the Hubble color palette. I shot this from my backyard on the outskirts of Crowders Mountain state park on 2018-06-06 - 2018-06-07.\r\n\r\nGain 0, offset 5\r\n19 x 300”  Ha 6nm\r\n39 x 300”  OIII 6nm\r\n39 x 300”  SII 6nm\r\n10x300\" Dark\r\n45x0\" Bias\r\n10 Flats for each filter\r\n\r\nI also shot 60x10 of luminance, but the details don't show, and I don't think it would integrate nicely.",
