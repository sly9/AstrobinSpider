    "description": "WeSb 2 is has only recently been included in the HASH database of PNs 202.189.117.101:8999/gpne/objectInfoPage.php?id=713\r\nThis is the result of the first ever narrowband image of this PN produced by Peter Goodhew in December 2020.  His excellent image is here on Astrobin:  https://www.astrobin.com/5m0zfi/B/\r\nAlso known as PK183+05.1.\r\n\r\nMy Abell Collection is here:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\nCurrently 60+, and soon to be complete.\r\n\r\nWeSb 2 was discovered by Ronald Weinberger and Franco Sabbadin in 1981.  Details are included in their 1981 paper \r\nhttp://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1981A%26A...100...66W&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf\r\nand includes details of 5 other possible PN discoveries they made.\r\nThe info about WeSb2 included in this paper are:\r\n\r\n\"No 2: half ring with a mean thickness of 15\" and m = 23.4 plus a rather homogeneous, hardly visible disk with m = 24.8.  The overall diameter is 135\"x135\".  Nothing visible on blue senstive print.\"\r\n\r\nThey point out that it is only a half disk, and hardly visible.  Peter's and my images clearly show the disk with one side much weaker than the other side, essentially a half disk if not adequately imaged.  The Ha is exceptionally weak, perhaps the dimmest Ha target I have imaged.  And the Oiii is vastly dimmer than the Ha.  No image whatsoever of either shows up on individual subs.\r\n\r\nThis is only the second narrow band image of WeSb 2 ever published.",
