    "description": "Ever wonder what it looks like to resolve the stars in M33? Yeah, I was wondering the same thing. Luckily the 14.5\" RCOS at DSW decided to satisfy my new desire to look deep deep into galaxies. This is going to be a fun go around I think. While the gear I use seems to be spiraling out of control, the one thing that also continues to remain constant with every upgrade in gear is just how important processing is. This is some of the best data I have ever worked with. While there are some things I am definitely unhappy with in the image, there is a lot I really do enjoy. This data actually came with a couple hours of HA frames with it, but I skipped adding those. I didn't think the data really needed, you can see how much HA was captured in the L and R frames alone in this image.",
