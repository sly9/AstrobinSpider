    "description": "We've been having a lot of cloud cover recently, so when I had two (very short) clear nights I jumped on capturing RGB to add to my existing Ha image. The RGB captures showed what I thought was very little signal, but when combined using Ha as luminance there was so much color I had to desaturate significantly to get the result here. \r\n\r\nDrifting through deep space 600 light-years distant, the spectral image of a pale lavender ghost floating toward a bright blue star is another example of the endless variation of wonders the universe presents to us. The clouds of dust and gas are illuminated in relief by the star. Over an incalculable amount of time ultraviolet light pressure from the star has sculpted the clouds.  The star is named Gamma Cassiopeia; it is the center star of the W-shaped constellation Cassiopeia.\r\n\r\nIC59 and IC63 are a pair of emission and reflection nebulae that lie approximately 600 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia. IC69 (below and slightly left of center) is called the \"Ghost of Cassiopeia.\" The very bright star, Gamma Cassiopeia, illuminates these great clouds of gas and dust.",
