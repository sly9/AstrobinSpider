    "description": "Finally I have figured it out to edit these recordings of my La Palma holiday 2018 finished.\r\nCountless attempts failed to separate the Dark Clouds of Dust from the background. The reason for this was the Saharadust (Calima), which was strongly represented on the night of the shooting. Parted with strong airglow I had really violent gradients in the picture, which I did not get eliminated. It was only when Starnett appeared that I was able to remove the stars and so I managed to free the background from the gradients as much as possible and make a handsome picture of them. Now I am very satisfied with the result :) Hope the straggler likes it?\r\nBest greeting and stays healthy\r\nFlo",
