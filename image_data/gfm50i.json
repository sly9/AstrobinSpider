    "description": "A faint circular diffuse evolved planetary nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius. I believe that this is the first colour photograph of this object, and the first amateur photograph taken. \r\nIt was discovered on 29 June 1998 by the MASH (Macquarie/AAO/Strasbourg H-Alpha) team using the Anglo-Australian Observatory UK Schmidt Telescope (AAO/UKST) H-alpha survey.\r\n\r\nBecause it is so faint the narrowband data was captured at bin 3x3.\r\nThe central star of the planetary nebula (CSPN) is clearly visible as the blue star that is dead centre.\r\n\r\nReference: Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 373, 79-94 published November 2006.",
