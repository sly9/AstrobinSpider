    "description": "Active region 2781 and a nice little prominence on 11-6-2020.\r\n\r\nImage courtesy of a Daystar Quantum 0.4 angstrom filter with a 4x Powermate.\r\n\r\nBest 90 frames out of 10,000 were stacked with Autostakkert after being captured with Sharpcap.  Processing was in Photoshop with some mild wavelet touch-ups in Registax.  \r\n\r\nGuiding was provided by a Hinode Solar Guider, which works amazingly well.  Highly recommended!!",
