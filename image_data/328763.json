    "description": "This is probably one of my favorite images I've made. There are a few things I wish I could fix though. For example, near the core, I have some slight ringing from deconvolution. Couldn't get them to get away though without messing up all the other stars using deringing. I tried redoing this with a different method for deon that uses no derining and just replaces the stars, but it made everything look too sharp and artificial. When trying to help hide the ringing though, my stars became bigger than I would have liked. Aside from that... I am quite happy. I was especially pleased with how much Ha showed up even with no Ha frames added.\r\n\r\nWhat is the nearest major galaxy to our own Milky Way Galaxy? Andromeda. In fact, our Galaxy is thought to look much like Andromeda. Together these two galaxies dominate the Local Group of galaxies. The diffuse light from Andromeda is caused by the hundreds of billions of stars that compose it. The several distinct stars that surround Andromeda's image are actually stars in our Galaxy that are well in front of the background object. Andromeda is frequently referred to as M31 since it is the 31st object on Messier's list of diffuse sky objects. M31 is so distant it takes about two million years for light to reach us from there.Much about M31 remains unknown, including exactly how long it will before it collides with our home galaxy.\r\n\r\nSource: APOD",
