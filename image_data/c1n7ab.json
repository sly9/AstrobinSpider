    "description": "This image (somehow) even surpasses my Markarian's Eye image now for shortest integration time. This one was an absolute beast to process as well though, but for different reasons. This image luckily had calibration frames, and the exposures weren't high enough to the point of getting extreme artifacts. However, I think I struggled the most with the very low SNR, and trying to blend the Ha with the color data. I normally have no issue with it- not sure why this one was so much more difficult. But like the Eyes, this image has been getting thrown into the PI fight ring for years now, just for it to walk out with me being upset with it. This is the first version I can definitely say I am happy with. Star blooming is still insane, but oh well.",
