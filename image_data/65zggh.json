    "description": "This image is dominated by M101 (also known as Arp 26 and NGC 5457). In Arp's Peculiar Galaxies catalog, it is classified as \"spiral galaxy with one heavy arm\". Arp's observing notes describe the \"one heavy arm\" as having a \"bright knot\"  This bright knot is likely NGC 5462 - A HII region. There are seven other such regions (NGC 5447, 49, 50, 51, 53, 55, 61). An eighth, NGC 5471, is either a HII region or a Wolf-Rayet companion galaxy. NGC 5477 is the galaxy on the left it is a member of the M101 galaxy group. There are 21 members according to the Simbad database - most of which are not in this image's field of view. These objects and some of the brighter stars and background galaxies are identified in the <a href=\"http://www.jthommes.com/Astro/images/M101_Edge7_PI1_PS2_IP1_Crp_annotated.jpg\">annotated image</a>. Horizontal FOV is approximately 38 arc minutes. Full size image scale is 0.76 arcsec/pix.",
