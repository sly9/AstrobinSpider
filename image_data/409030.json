    "description": "Back when I captured this airliner transiting the moon on April 5, 2017, I knew next to nothing about post-processing.  Someone purchased this print from my Etsy store, so I decided to revisit the post-processing on it from scratch before shipping it to them.  It's amazing to me how much my skills have improved in two years.  If you care, you can see my original attempt by going back through my Astrobin gallery.  I'm much happier with this version.\r\n\r\nAs an example, there was bad vignetting in the capture video.  Two years ago, I had no idea how to get rid of it or the dust bunnies...so I just cropped them out.  Using Camera Lens Correction in Photoshop's Camera Raw Filter, I was able to get rid of the vignetting and present the image in full!\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, the gear I used isn't showing up.  It was captured with my Canon T6 on a C8 and a Celestron Evolution mount.",
