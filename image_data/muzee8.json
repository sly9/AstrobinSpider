    "description": "IC2948, usually known as the Running Chicken, or more accurately the Lambda Centaurus nebula, is a really big target which doesn't fit in my usual FOV. So I picked my favourite part here, which to me looks like a tulip flower. Of course my favourite details are the Bok globules in the upper right quadrant, I took some care to ensure they were sharpened just enough.\r\n\r\nHOO rendering yielded a fairly standard red/pink palette, but I decided to get a bit creative in adding some less-conventional colours. I like the result, something just a bit different! Also tried a new technique for RGB stars, taking hundreds of 20sec exposures and selecting only the best sixty or so to stack for each channel, I think the result is a nice balance. The wonderful Screen Blend mode in Photoshop did the final blending of the images, gotta say it's way better than what I can achieve in PixInsight.",
