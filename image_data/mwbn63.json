    "description": "Along the border of Orion and Monoceros lies a beautiful angel, NGC 2170.  I've always loved this area and was happy to circle back with the CDK to see if I could really flush it out.  After a first run through, Steve and I decided that we'd go deeper on the luminance and added an additional 8 hours from the first iteration of the image that I processed in November.  It definitely cleaned it up and brought out more of the chocolatey brown dust around the area.",
