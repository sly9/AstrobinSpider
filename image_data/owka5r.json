    "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nFor many people, this may be a trivial situation, thinking about a night trip into the wilderness of the forest, because what for? When she participates in such a moment, everything takes on a different color. I'm going north in the snow-covered forest because the very shores. I am surprised that I gladly open the window at -12C and, walking slowly, I listen to the sounds of snow tires on the frozen snow, it has not been such a long time. Being in such places, I already know why winter fairy tales and fairy tales were created.\r\n\r\nHans Christian Andersen would not be ashamed of the scenery for his winter fairy tales, he could with a clear conscience put fragments of \"The Snow Queen\" in this Polish scenery. The branches of spruce trees bend strongly in places from many layers of snow, the other side of the road is poorer in coniferous stands. Plus that night with sparkling stars and creaking snow. The road runs almost exactly from south to north. Such a trail destination majestically presents the Cosmic hunter in the southern skies, the Mythological Orion. Orion rises above the forest, showing its nebular treasures. A seasoned eye will notice the structures of the winter Milky Way and many other constellations.\r\n\r\nFrosty Winter, tonight will be photographic night only for a moment, about 1 hour. There is really little time for a photo. After an hour, our night spy will illuminate the entire sky and we will lose many contrasts by the reflected light from the moon. As long as I am gathering new frames while contemplating in this silence. You can feel this Stellar Cosmos, I wish you could hear the Winter Forest. \r\n\r\nPanorama:\r\nCanon EOS R mod plus Sigma 28mm f1.4 ART\r\n60 x 15 s ISO3200 @ f2.0 Tripod\r\n\r\nAdditionally, my photo was highlighted today as\r\nAstronomy Picture of the Day APOD 06/02/2021 \r\n\r\nhttps://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html \r\n\r\nSocial: \r\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/lukaszzakphoto\r\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/lukaszzak/",
