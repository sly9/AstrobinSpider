    "description": "I've taken this image of our lonely neighbor around the November's full moon. \r\n\r\nI was testing and tuning my collimation on the balcony, taking advantage of a clear night with a full moon. Once I was done, the Moon ended up in my field of view and I have taken this photo which consists of a 4 panel mosaic.",
