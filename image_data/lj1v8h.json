    "description": "As my sky (and my skills) generally render LRGB imaging of nebula a challenge, my goal with the Pleiades was to produce a respectable image--nothing fancy.  I must say CMOS style imaging has its drawbacks.  Between the subs, the calibration frames and calibrated subs, the registered subs, and the  SFS grouping of subs that were chosen to be used, I nearly used up all the storage space I have on two computers and an external flash drive.  It makes shooting multiple images simultaneously very difficult.  I do this quite often as targets rise and set.   On the other hand, lots of subs makes for pretty clean data.  Also, due to the speed of the system (F3), I was pretty much limited to 30 second exposures for luminance, as my sky brightness is nigh on blinding.  I tried 2min subs, but the Pleiades stars are just to bright.  Even 30 sec subs overexposed the brightest stars.  Despite the difficulties and obstacles,  I am quite pleased with the way this cluster and nebula came out.  I was blessed with fairly good seeing for some of the shoot, but poor seeing for some of it as well.  I chose to emphasize some of the dark structures lurking in the nebula, and the non saturated stars look OK.  All in all, its a keeper for me.  Next time I will improve the result.  For now--the sisters have worn out their welcome and I am already in the midst of my next challenge.  They have changed me, though, as all good relationships do...I am shooting two LRGB nebula simultaneously!  I hope the damsels put a good word in for me with Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nI added  a bit over 3 hours of lum data I collected with the np101is and STT-8300 camera.  The stars are not as good, but the nebulosity detail is much better.",
