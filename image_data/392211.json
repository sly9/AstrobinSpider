    "description": "This is a well-known trio of galaxies in Leo, clockwise from top NGC 3628 (sometimes known as the hamburger or hot-dog galaxy), and M65, then M66, the two much brighter galaxies discovered by Charles Messier in 1780. All three are about 35 million light years away and show considerable evidence of tidal warping, indicating that they have been pulling at each other.",
