    "description": "I took the exposures of the Milky Way on the 18th of September at Hohe Dirn - which is one of the darkest places in Austria. In the colder months - when the mist covers the rather sparsely populated valleys around the 1134m high mountain - this location is almost as dark as it can get.\r\nI was able to collect 10 frames รก 5 min. (no L-Pro needed) before the core got too close to the surrounding mountains.\r\n\r\nThe foreground was taken with my phone (unfortunately no DSLR) on a two hour long drive home. The mountain range seen there is called \"Gosaukamm\" and is not far from Hallstatt.",
