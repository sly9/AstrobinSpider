    "description": "The Iris Nebula (NGC 7023) in Cepheus was one of the first images I wanted to work on when I got my scope.  The bright reflection nebula is surrounded by dust about 1,300 light-years away.  I took this image back in May but didn't work on it because I wanted to get a lot more exposure time.  Unfortunately, the weather hasn't cooperated and Summer is almost over with, time to move on to other areas.  So I went with it for now and I can always add to it, or do over next year.  Here is my version of the Iris Nebula:\r\n\r\nCanon 6D ISO 1600\r\nSV80 at 480mm f/6\r\n24 x 360 sec",
