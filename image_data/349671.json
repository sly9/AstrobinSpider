    "description": "â€¦.and now for the hat trick of first light images.  That's three-in-a-row!   This marks first light for the Astronomik L3 Luminance filter and the matching Deep Sky RGB set.     \r\n\r\nMessier 82 is one of the closest examples of a starburst galaxy.  It's beet red hydrogen alpha emission jets are fueled by tremendous supernova activity in the core.   It is believed that there is one supernova every few years down deep within the center of this galaxy.     This activity is a result of interactions with its close neighbor M81 and both galaxies are relatively close at 10-12 million light years.   \r\n\r\nWhile I am certainly happy with the result, I found myself wishing I had put even more luminance time into it.   There is a lot of extended structure and IFN (dust from our own galaxy) in the field.  From my moderate light pollution, it would have taken quite a bit more time to get some definition of these details.   But, this target is hitting my roof too soon to catch some more this year.   I'll likely return for more when it comes back around.     This hobby is the epitome of \"you can't have it all\".  \r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
