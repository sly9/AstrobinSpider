Some of the stars are believed to be less than a million years old. About half of the half of the young stars forming double- or multi-star complexes, often in very tight pairs.\r\n\r\nAssociated with this nebula are small, dark clouds silhouetted against the bright background. These are known as “Thackeray’s Globules” in this nebula, but as “Bok’s Globules” more generally. A study of these features suggests that they are evaporating rapidly, the what we observe are the remaining fragments of what was once one or more larger dark clouds. A close-up of one of the more structured globules appears Here: https://www.astrobin.com/1hecsf/?nc=user",
