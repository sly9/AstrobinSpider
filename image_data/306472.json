    "description": "There are so many beautiful regions of dust, gas, and open clusters in the constellations of Cepheus and Cassiopeia. Even though this is a four panel mosaic shot with a 350mm focal length scope, it's still really just a small taste of all the different things in this area of the sky. \r\n\r\nIn the upper right of this mosaic is Sh2-155, the Cave Nebula. Below it in the middle-right portion is Sh2-154 with the small open cluster NGC 7419 just under it. The bright nebula near the bottom, left of center, is the Lobster Claw Nebula, or Sh2-157. Open Cluster NGC 7510 is in upper right part of the Lobster Claw. Just above and slightly to the left of the Lobster Claw is NGC 7635, the Bubble Nebula. Above and to the left of the Bubble is Open Cluster M52. The small bright nebula just left of center is NGC 7538.\r\n\r\nThis was shot over 4 or 5 nights from July 6th to July 12th. It is 30X600s per panel with the William Optics Star71 and SBIG STF-8300M set at -10C. I wish I could have cooled the sensor a bit more, but this was all the camera would do with the heat I was seeing then.\r\n",
