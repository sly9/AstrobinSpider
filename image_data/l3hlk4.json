    "description": "IC 4628, also known as the Prawn Nebula and Gum 56 is an emission nebula in the constellation of Scorpius at a distance from Earth of 6,000 light-years.  The nebula is around 250 light-years in diameter, so this image covers approximately 170 light-years.  The nebula is a stellar nursery with a large number of hot, luminous, young stars that were formed from the surrounding gas.  Two large, hot, blue-white class O giants and other young stars in the nebula illuminate the surrounding gas due to the massive amount of ultraviolet radiation they produce, thus ionizing the gases in the nebula.\r\nHope ya like it!\r\nTom",
