It is a region of intense star formation, and has a diameter that exceeds 1000 light-years. The star cluster R136 in the center of the nebula produces much of the energy that makes the nebula visible. It is the largest known emission nebula. It is about 100 times as far away as the Great Orion Nebula, and if it were In the same distance that Orion is of us (1500 Light Years) would cover an area of ​​60 full moons, being able to cause shadows (Wikipedia) Initially it was considered a star, however in 1971 Nicolas Louis de Lacaille identified it like a nebula.",
