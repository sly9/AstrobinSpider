    "description": "First light of my rig set at my tiny little observatory at Stellar skies in Pontotoc Texas!\r\n\r\nI got a small observatory closer to Austin that is accessible (it is under 2 hours from my house). After months of dragging my feet, I finally set up the system over at the observatory.  I am starting with a widefield setup and hope to get to 2+ m at somepoint.\r\n\r\nThere are few things that still need to be worked out - Roof control is still manual and it is a bit unnerving not to have automatic closing of roof in case of bad weather :)\r\n\r\nThere is still work to be done tuning the CTU to fix tilt but it is manageable. \r\n\r\nI absolutely love dusty targets in broadband and most of my widefield images are from my backyard in Austin and I could only manage narrowband. So my first target is in the Perseus region with its tons of interesting targets. NGC1333 has always been very interesting and I went after it with 10 minute subs.  The result has been delightfully dusty! I really like how this turned out.  \r\n\r\nThis has been processed in Pixinsight and finished in Photoshop.",
