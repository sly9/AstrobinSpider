    "description": "The Pleiades (Messier 45) is an open star cluster roughly 450 light years away in the constellation of Taurus. Stars in the cluster formed within the last 100 million years.  Although one of the brightest objects in the night sky, M45 merits long integration times (multiple long exposures) since this helps bring out the rich sea of dust surrounding the cluster. This reflection nebula was once thought to be the material from which stars in the cluster formed. It is now believed to be a dust cloud lying between us and the cluster, through which the cluster's light passes.\r\n\r\nM45 was photographed between 26 September and 24 November 2019 from a remote imaging rig that is jointly owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me.  This is a two panel mosaic.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nCamera: QSI 683\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nLum: 120 x 300s\r\nRed: 60 x 300s\r\nGreen: 60 x 300s\r\nBlue: 55 x 300s\r\n\r\nA total of 24 hours and 35 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Steve Milne",
