    "description": "M77 and NGC1055 are two beautiful galaxies in the constellation of Cetus. I've chosen the field not only because of their presence but also because it's pretty crowded by many other faint galaxies, indeed apart from the small NGC1072 (which nucleus was nicely resolved) several other galaxies are present, up to magnitude 21. This really impressed me.\r\n\r\nIn particular, around Cetus A (M77) many faint galaxies can be detected. PGC 5238561, in particular, is a very faint 20.96 mag that appears as an extremely faint dot just slightly detached from the background, but after 6.6 hours the signal is there! Such an amazing result for an economic 150mm Newtonian...",
