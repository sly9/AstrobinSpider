    "description": "The Helix strikes the Zenith in Namibia, so I took the advantage to try a photo in LRGB Ha and OIII channels, using an 8\" f/4 Newtonian and ASI1600MMC in the south observatory of your Viennese club WAA.  28+14+12+14 x3min subframes LRGB and 24+23 x3min subframes Ha and OIII. Yes, 3min only each, ASI at zero gain, barely background limited in Namibia. ;-)\r\n\r\nPresented are a crop on the main part of the Helix and its delicate interior structures, a 66% sized full field showing the outer portions in Ha alsong with some field galaxies, an annotated version, and a blink between Ha and OIII frames. How different the nebula looks in these channels! \r\n\r\nStructures are enhanced a bit mostly by PixInsights HDR compression tool, only a little sharpening.  The LRGB mix is just enhanced by NB in the weaker parts, and part of NB is used as a Luminance enhancement in the respective color channels.",
