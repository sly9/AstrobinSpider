    "description": "The completed two pane mosaic of this often imaged galactic pair.  The combination of the TEC140 and QSI690 has enabled such fine detail to be teased out with a very rewarding result that has taken two day's worth of processing in total, circa 16 hours of concentration.  I finished last night at midnight and have aching eyes this morning, then some much needed objective feedback from my imaging partner Steve Milne gave me the boost to complete the final tweaks and balancing of brightness, colour, and depth between the two panes.  Thanks Steve.\r\n\r\nHints of IFN swirl around the pair and I have enedavoured to make them visible but faint in an effort to represent their relative apparent brightness.  I worked hard with multiple masks to highlight the spiralling dust in the arms of M81, gentle application of PI's LHE tool without it becoming overly artificial (I hope).\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy the image at high resolution.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
