He kindly allow me to process this high quality image, what gave me  too nuch pleasure,\r\n\r\nCapture:\r\n\r\nImaging telescope or lens: Takahashi FSQ-106ED\r\nImaging camera: QHY CCD QHY16200A\r\nMount: Astro-Physics AP MACH1 GTO\r\nGuiding camera: QHY5L-II mono\r\nFilter: Baader LRGB 2\" Filters\r\nAccessories: Stardome,  Precise Parts custom adaptors,  sharpsky.net SharpSky Pro digital focuser\r\nResolution: 4514x3602\r\nDates: June 24, 2017\r\n\r\nFrames: 37x300\"\r\nIntegration: 3.1 hours\r\nRA center: 253.724 degrees\r\nDEC center: -42.756 degrees\r\nPixel scale: 2.327 arcsec/pixel\r\nOrientation: 178.409 degrees\r\nField radius: 1.866 degrees\r\n\r\nDesc:\r\nThe area around the blue-yellow pair of stars Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 in Scorpius includes the extensive RCW 113 (Gum 55) emission nebula, and two dark nebulae: Sandqvist 17 (SL 17, or Wolf nebula) at bottom, and Sandqvist 19 (SL 19) at upper left. The RCW 113 nebula, located 5000 light years far from us, shines due to ionisation by ultraviolet light emitted by OB stars belonging to the open cluster NGC 6231 (at top) and its surroundings.\r\n\r\n\"NGC 6231 is a young cluster in the southern sky, around 3-5 Myr old,\r\nlocated at a distance of about 1.6 kpc at the near side of the Sagittarius spiral arm.\r\nIt forms the nucleus of the extended Sco OB1 association. The cluster is very rich,\r\nwith more than 100 massive stars, among them 15 O-stars. Radial velocity studies\r\nhave revealed a very large binary fraction among these OB stars. The young low mass\r\npopulation has recently been identified using deep X-ray observations. Within the\r\nlarge HII region Gum 55 that surrounds NGC 6231 there exists a major elephant trunk,\r\nwhich shows evidence for recent second-generation star formation in the form of young\r\nB-stars surrounded by reflection nebulae and a number of low-mass Hα emission stars.\"\r\n(Handbook of Star Forming Regions Vol. II, Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 2008\r\nBo Reipurth, ed., see galaxymap.org)",
