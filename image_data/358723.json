    "description": "This is the first image I did this year, with the nebula ranging 50 to 30 graus of altitude. \r\nAlthough this object is high in the sky for the entire summer, this year in my place it just rainned a lot making impossible to make some astrophotograpyy. Next year I will capture more frames to make this image better \r\n\r\nThis image has been captured the filters Hydrogen-Alpha and the Oxygen III, being the last , by far, the strongest channel.\r\n  \r\nSharpless 308 has close to 60 light-years across, blown by the fierce winds of the huge Wolf-Rayet star HD 50896 (also known as EZ Canis Majoris - star in the centre of the image), expanding by the effect of oxygen that has been ejected from Wolfe -Rayet star WR 6.\r\n \r\nThe nebula has an age of about 70,000 years and is located some 5,200 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Canis Major, the Greater Dog.\r\n\r\nSharpless 308 is one of only two known Wolf-Rayet bubbles that emits X-rays. The green halo marks the end of the shock wave that the star is blowing out into space, while the blues and reds that round out the bubble are the result of powerful solar winds colliding with surrounding material in the region.\r\n\r\nLike any good bubble, this one will eventually burst. Sharpless 308 will disperse its stellar material into the surrounding space within a few million years, to explode as a supernova.\r\n\r\nWolf-Rayet (WR) stars are extremely rare and short-lived super-hot stars which start their lives with dozens of times the mass of our Sun, but rapidly loose most of it through a powerful stellar wind, with speeds up to 2000 km/s. They are also highly luminous, from tens of thousands to several million times the luminosity of the Sun,.\r\n\r\nIMAGE:\r\nO3: 18 frames 1800 S\r\nHa: 15 frames 1200 s\r\nBias, Flats and Dak applied  \r\n\r\nCAMERA\r\nST8300M Guided\r\n\r\nTELESCOPE: \r\nSkywatcher Esprit ED APO 120mm f/7\r\n\r\nMOUNT:\r\nSkywatcher NEQ 6 Pro",
