    "description": "I had the wish for a nice and sharp portrait of the trunk. This time I decided for a darker more mystical version, were the stars are dominantly glowing. I love especially the wonderful structures in the lower part, which are stunning with every focal length. Again OIII was the most difficult part to expose, but I had a quite good night for that. Size is reduced for Straton software and image is cropped. Hope you like this dark version too...",
