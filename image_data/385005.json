    "description": "I am pleased to have completed another goal with this 4 panel mosaic of the Gamma Cass evocative nebula \"The Ghost\" and the surrounding Ha nebula that wraps wave-like around the beautiful blue glow of Gamma Cass.  I was inspired after seeing Olly Penrice's image back in 2017, https://astrob.in/295716/0/.\r\n\r\nSteve and I have persevered with weather since late October 2018 to bring together 88 hours of data.  A marathon processing evening yesterday gave me the main image with finishing touches after work today.  We have a vague notion to fill out the mosaic and to connect to NGC281 . . . but not just yet thank goodness.\r\n\r\nI have posted a rotated version to better see the \"Breaking Wave\".\r\n\r\nThanks for looking & enjoy the full resolution and the sharp optics of the Tak FSQ106.\r\n\r\nCS!",
