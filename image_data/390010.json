    "description": "What a challenge to process this. Getting the galaxy distinct from all of the dust is quite the challenge. Even more so though is trying to reduce the impact of shooting through all that galactic dust that shifts the color of this galaxy wayyy in the yellow direction. While it may be enjoyable to some, I much prefer the look of the classic blue and yellow galaxy rather than pure yellow. A bit of a shift in color from how it is normally presented, but I think presented it like we would *normally* see it was a nice change :)",
