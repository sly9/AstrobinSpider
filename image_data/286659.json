    "description": "This is data that I have processed from the Liverpool Telescope, a 2 meter scope on La Palma, Canary Islands. At their site they have quite a lot of data on the Eagle, so I ended up making a four panel mosaic, downloading totally 96 subs from the following filters for each panel: Ha (3 x 60s), Bessell B (mainly blue, 3 x 90s), Bessell V (mainly green, 3 x 60s), Sloan-r (red, 3 x 60s), and clear (12 x 60-90s). Ttotally 27 min per panel and 1.8 hours for the whole image. That does not sound much so clearly, aperture has helped with the quality of the data.",
