    "description": "A two pane mosaic of this supernova remnant and it spectacular shells of expanding gases and its associated emission nebula Sharpless 249.  This is the second process, however initially I chose a classic Hubble Pallete with its orange-yellow hues.  It was a great image but I felt I wanted more of a contrast between all of the interacting gases across the frame.\r\n\r\nAfter some experimentation I modified the Blue channel mapping (Ha x OIII)xOIII and after some Colour Mask work I ended with the Jellyfish itself rendered with a redder hue that gave a marked contrast to Sh249 and also revealed the structure of the narrow neck of accelerating remnant gases.  Of course processing Mu and Eta Geminorum was a challenge!\r\n\r\nCaptured through January and into early Febraury.  I have dated the image for today's reprocess.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
