    "description": "Takahashi Epsilon 130 has come back to me, and it told me it was hungry for photons, even begging for a great motive. It is my holy duty to obey my telescopes. Here you go, 142x3min Subs with Eos6d mod at iso800 and Optolong L-Pro filter. \r\n\r\nA fullframe clip filter proved to introduce too much vignetting for this extremely fast f/ratio, so I put a 2\" filter into Takahashis Eos bajonet adapter, that houses a convenient M48 thread.\r\n\r\nNGC7000 and IC5070 don't need introduction, the cloud of dust that separates them is known by the name \"the dark river\".\r\n\r\nThe colors are left \"native\", as color calibration in PixInsight delivered. Just more saturated. Resisted to tweak the reds, and no extra H-Apha added.\r\n\r\nIt's a 66% version, 100% having more than 36MB was too much.",
