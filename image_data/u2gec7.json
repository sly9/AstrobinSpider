    "description": "One of the things I’ve always enjoyed about astrophotography is the opportunity to create a unique perspective into the universe around us. I hope this one lets you ponder a view Earthlings can’t possibly see from home.\r\n\r\nThis unique look is a north polar projection of Saturn. You are essentially seeing a top down view of the planet’s north pole and ring system. \r\n\r\nThe dark clouds of the polar hexagon can be seen here, though the linear edges of the hexagon are hard to discern.  Getting there.",
