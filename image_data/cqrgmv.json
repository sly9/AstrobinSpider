    "description": "I spent most of this session on Jupiter and will post those images soon.\r\n\r\nConditions were overall good: some challenges with \"slow\" seeing effects (periodic complete blurring of the target) but the \"fast\" seeing was good bordering on excellent.\r\n\r\nSome nice contrast in the bands for this image, albeit with the polar hexagon not being quite as distinct. Possibly went a bit far with the sharpening on the rings.  :)\r\n\r\nThis image is a de-rotation of 5 individual stacks, with each stack containing around 1,400 frames (top 15% stacked).\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
