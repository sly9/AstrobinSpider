    "description": "StDr 56 / Goblet of Fire nebula (c) Robert Pölzl & Marcel Drechsler & Xavier Srottner\r\nThis probable new planetary nebula was discovered by my colleague Xavier Strottner and me in January 2020. \r\nIf the candidate is confirmed as a true planetary nebula, it will be the first planetary nebula ever discovered in the constellation Triangulum (Triangle).\r\n\r\nPhoto: StDr56 was photographed by the Austrian Robert Pölzl with a total exposure of 59 hours.\r\nImage processing: Marcel Drechsler \r\n\r\nAt the centre of the PN candidate is a potential white dwarf with a surface temperature of 35542 Kelvin and a distance of about 1130 light years to Earth. With an extension of 44 x 36 arc minutes, StDr56 is not only the largest probable PN in the region, but in the night sky it covers more than half of the area of the famous Triangulum Galaxy M33, which is located only a few degrees from Strottner-Drechsler 56.\r\n\r\nRobert Pölzl collected 90 hours of exposure time in 21 nights from July to November 2020.\r\nOut of these 90 hours, 30 hours had to be sorted out because of minimal cirrus and dew - leaving 59 hours at the end.\r\n\r\nCoordinates: 02:07:17.41 +30:05:11.90 (J2000)\r\nName: Strottner-Drechsler 56, StDr56, PN-G: 141.8-29.9\r\n\r\nData:\r\n58 x 30 min. H-alpha\r\n41 x 30 min [OIII].\r\n28 x 10 min. RGB each\r\nDate: 31.7.2020 - 18.11.2020\r\n\r\nLocation: Observatory Hirschegg-Österreich\r\nOptics: Lacerta Newton 10\" f/4\r\nCamera: Moravian G2 8300 at -30° - Baader filter",
