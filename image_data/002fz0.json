    "description": "The needle galaxy is a famous edge-on spiral galaxy.  It is a bit small for my 5.5\" refractor on a APSH sensor.  Good news is the quality of image from  TEC140 is darn good. It could hold the clarity and sharpness even with a large crop.  In last couple of days,  clear sky finally came after two weeks rain, and  it really helps near new moon. I was able to complete this subject starting from March.  I shot 10 hours ha, but it barely showed up in the final result.  I think ha can be ignored. \r\n\r\nNights:\r\n3/20/2021, 3/21/2021, 3/23/2021, 3/24/2021, 3/35/2021,  4/18/2021, 4/19/2021, 4/20/2021, 5/2/2021\r\n\r\nSubs:\r\nHa:  19x1800s\r\nL :  40x600s\r\nRGB:  15x600s each",
