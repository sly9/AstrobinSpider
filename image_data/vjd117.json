    "description": "The Auris Nebula was discovered in early 2020 by Xavier Strottner, Marcel Drechsler and Dana Patchick (catalogue PaStDr).\r\nFor the photo 32.5 hours exposure time at the large 1 meter telescope at the Chilean telescope were necessary.\r\nThis makes the object one of the faintest objects ever photographed by our team.\r\n\r\nThe object is located at a distance of about 1250 light years from Earth and can only be observed from the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the Auris Nebula is not yet clear at this time. \r\nPresumably it is a planetary nebula that has emerged from a binary star system. This assumption is supported by the numerous arcs and rings that make up the nebula.\r\nBut there are also some indications that it could be a rare nova object. Evidence for this is, among other things, the absence of a central OIII bubble and the eastern arch, which contains a big amount of SII gas.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * \r\n\r\nCoordinates: 15:46:3.76 -64:43:57.52 (J2000)\r\nConstellation: Triangulum australe (Southern Triangle)\r\nSize (north-south): about 8 minutes of arc\r\n\r\nPhoto:\r\nH-alpha: 52x1200s\r\nOIII: 36x1200s\r\nRGB: 19x600s\r\n\r\nCopyright: Marcel Drechsler / Xavier Strottner",
