    "description": "This is the first complete image taken with my new Esprit 120. All I can say is this scope is amazing!\r\nThe Pacman Nebula is an emission nebula located in the constellation Cassiopeia. NGC 281 gets its name from the classic video game character it resembles.\r\nNGC 281 is a rather diffuse emission nebula. It includes a small, yet noticeable open star cluster (IC 1590) and some really dynamic dust lanes. The prominent lane of dark dust cutting into this nebula creates the mouth.\r\n \r\nEquipment:\r\nTelescope - Sky-watcher Esprit 120\r\nImaging Camera- ZWO ASI 1600mm Pro Cool\r\nMount - Sky-watcher EQ6-R Pro\r\n \r\nSoftware:\r\nSequence Generator Pro\r\nPixensight\r\nLightroom\r\nPhotoshop\r\n \r\nLights:\r\nSII-70x600sec\r\nHA- 60x600sec\r\nOiii-65x600sec\r\nRed-20x90sec\r\nGreen-20x90sec\r\nBlue-20x90sec\r\n30 Darks\r\n100 Bias\r\nTotal integration 34 Hours",
