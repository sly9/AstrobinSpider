    "description": "This object is an emission nebula located 1500 light years away in the constellation of Perseus. The nebula is 100 light years long.  The bright star Xi Persei in this image is most likely ionizing the hydrogen gas is the nebula. I am surprised that this bright popular nebula is not listed in any of the main catalogs, but that is because it is so hard to see visually.  \r\n\r\nA galaxy (IC 2005) can be seen through the nebula at left center in the image, although it only appears as a small fuzzy star.",
