    "description": "I think this is actually my favorite image from a night up atop Haleakala. I had come earlier and setup this telescope and mount to do some deep sky imaging, but the wide field nightscapes blow me away. The air here was so crisp and clear, and the environment atop the volcano, you really felt like you were on an asteroid looking out into space. Another photographer in the distance was also taking nightscapes that night.\r\n\r\nCanon 5D, Mark III\r\n25 seconds on a tripod @ISO 3200\r\nRokinon 14mm f/2.8 lens wide open.\r\nImage is cropped down for framing.",
