    "description": "Orion's belt and sword widefield shot, imaged from light-polluted skies of Seville city (Andalusia, Spain), featuring the rich nebulosity in the area. Orange hues correspond to hydrogen and sulfur emission in infrared light, while bluish ones are related to oxygen emission in visible light. \r\n\r\nIn order to overcome the bright sky of a city and gain some contrast, we find ourselves forced to use narrowband filters. These filters select specific, less polluted colors, in which some atoms or molecules emit light. Processing is also fundamental to eliminate light pollution gradients and enhance the nebulosity. But nowadays, with the spread of white LEDs and their bright blue emission, even some of these filters won't help anymore. One of the exposures captured also a train of satellites beloging to a future megaconstellation. \r\n\r\nWe have to recover and protect our night sky. \r\n\r\nOrientation: North is left.\r\nDates: {1-3, 25, 27}/02/2020\r\nOptics: 135mm @ f/2.8\r\nHa: 45x300s, [OIII]: 24x300s, [SII]: 22x300s",
