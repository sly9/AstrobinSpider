    "description": "The Crescent Nebula (also known as NGC 6888, Caldwell 27, Sharpless 105) is an emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus, about 5000 light-years away from Earth. It is formed by the fast stellar wind from the Wolf-Rayet star WR 136 (HD 192163) colliding with and energizing the slower moving wind ejected by the star when it became a red giant around 250,000 to 400,000 years ago. The result of the collision is a shell and two shock waves, one moving outward and one moving inward. The inward moving shock wave heats the stellar wind to X-ray-emitting temperatures.\r\n\r\nSh2-104 can be found in bottom left corner, it also cataloged as DWB 14, is about 14,000 light years away toward the Cygnus constellation. This is located due east of the popular Crescent Nebula. Sh-104 is viewed by professional astronomers as a good illustration of the \"collect and collapse\" model of star formation triggered by the rapid expansion of a HII.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of image there is blue arc related to the nebula associated with WR134 star. WR 134 is a variable Wolf-Rayet star located around 6,000 light years away from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus, surrounded by a faint bubble nebula blown by the intense radiation and fast wind from the star. It is five times the radius of the sun, but due to a temperature over 63,000 K it is 400,000 times as luminous as the Sun.",
