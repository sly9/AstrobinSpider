    "description": "I decided this afternoon that if it was clear tonight I would try and image IC 434.  I've\r\nnever imaged this object with my AT72ED and I wanted to try imaging it with the AT72ED.\r\nThe only problem and when I say that it really wasn't a problem but I could not begin\r\nimaging until 1:00 am or later because Orion would not be high enough in the sky\r\nbefore that time.   I had a nice clear sky and by 1:00 am the Moon had moved from almost\r\ndirectly overhead to very low and almost out of sight in the Western sky.   Please enjoy\r\nmy latest image of IC 434 the Horse Head Nebula.",
