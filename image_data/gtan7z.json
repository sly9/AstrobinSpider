    "description": "I always find wide field mosaic fascinating. And here comes this explorative project, which is my first wide field mosaic trial. It is indeed very technical challenging but also rewarding. Being in a light polluted town, it's a luxury to see even the silhouette of the Milky Way. But a wild field SHO like this gave me an idea of what it looks like. From the image I even found quite some inspiration for future projects. For example, NGC7635 and IC1470 may be a good match for a 500mm scope + full frame. And Cave Nebula is also prettier than I expected. We can even find some rare to see objects near the bottom of the photo. Like Sh 2-170 and Abell 85 (LBN576). Overall, it's quite a fun project. \r\n\r\nNow come the technical details. To my surprise, the little FMA180 scope could give sharp stars for a full frame sensor. This mosaic was stitched from 2x4 panels. We first used a customized PI script to do batch calibration and integration, and then threw the master frames into APP to do stitching. The final processing like SHO combination was done within PI and PS. There were actually quite severe banding in the O channel, due to problematic flat frames. But I haven't figured out what is the issue, so had to use DBE to remove them, ending up with imperfect results.",
