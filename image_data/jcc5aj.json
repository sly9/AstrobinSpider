    "description": "Hi friends!! Hope you enjoy this rendition of the Ghost nebula - IC 63 - HaRGB extracted from Liverpool Telescope ! Warm Regards !\r\n\r\n\"IC 59 and IC 63 - Reflection and Emission Nebulae\r\nIC 59 and IC 63 are faint reflection and emission nebula located in the northern constellation of Cassiopeia. They are challenging objects to spot with telescopes for a number of reasons. Both nebulae are faint at apparent mag. +10, they have extremely low surface brightness and surround bright variable star gamma Cas (Î³ Cas). This remarkable star is partly unstable and is known as a \"shell star\". It currently shines at mag. +2.15, making it the brightest star in Cassiopeia.\r\n\r\nIC 59 and IC 63 are 610 light-years distant. From our perspective, IC 59 is located on the northern side of gamma Cas and IC 63 to the northeast. Spatially the nebulae are roughly 3 light-years from gamma Cas, although IC 63 is slightly closer to the star. As a result, it's appears mostly red due to a dominance of H-alpha emission, whereas IC 59 exhibits much less H-alpha emission and appears mostly blue due to dust reflected starlight.\"\r\n\r\nSource: https://freestarcharts.com/ic-59",
