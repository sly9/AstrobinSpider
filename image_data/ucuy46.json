    "description": "For billions of years an intermediate mass star toils away in obscurity.  Then its outer atmosphere depletes exposing the core. Our ordinary star new enters a stage of flowering as we see here, bringing it to our attention -  but only for a few 10s of thousands of years.  As the nebulosity expands and fades the now white dwarf star soldiers on yet more billions of years.\r\n\r\nWhile March is often called Galaxy season due to the lack of grand nebulae in the northern sky, when the Moon is up I think of it as \"Abell\" season since Planetaries are about the only narrowband objects to shoot.  \r\n\r\nAbell 39 is nearly a perfect sphere, though Wikipedia notes \"the eastern limb of the nebula is 50% more luminous than the western limb. Additionally, irregularities in the surface brightness are seen across the face of the shell. The source of the eastâ€“west asymmetry is not known but it could be related to the offset of the central star.\r\n\r\nThere are some variations in brightness on the surface of the sphere - just enough to give a hint of texture.\r\n\r\nI've left this an an uncropped wide-field to give the feeling of loneliness, and maybe foreshadowing, as most of the stars in view will have a somewhat similar end.",
