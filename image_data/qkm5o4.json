    "description": "I'm really surprised that there is only one other image from this pretty object on Astrobin (or maybe I just used the search wrong). In any case it has been a tough one from my location. My light pollution is a little too severe to capture dark nebulae well. But nevertheless I wanted to capture it :)\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part was actually processing this image and it took me 3-4 tries to get the gradient correction right. At the bottom right is legitimate signal as these are the outskirts of the famous cone nebula.\r\n\r\nI hope you still enjoy it as much as me. Have a nice weekend everyone.",
