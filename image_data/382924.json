    "description": "Because we are currently in a minimum of the 11-year solar activity cycle, it can be rare to find something of photographic interest on the sun.  During these times the atmosphere can appear quite featureless.   This view shows the solar chromosphere in the hydrogen alpha wavelength, complete with a prominence visible at the edge.  \r\n\r\nI did get a chance to try out some new equipment and also to put a fresh spin on the processing.   I pulled up the levels on the faintest atmospheric structures in an effort to pull those into view.   What do you think?\r\n\r\nAs always, Enjoy!",
