    "description": "NGC 6752, also known as The Great Peacock Cluster, is the fourth-brightest globular cluster, after Omega Centauri, 47 Tucanae, and M 22.  It's located in the southern constellation Pavo at a distance from Earth of around 13,000 light-years, making it one of the closest globular clusters.  It shines at a magnitude of 5.4, which makes it visible to the unaided eye and it covers an area of around 3/4 the size of the full Moon.  \r\nThis data was taken at Deep Sky West- Chile with the TOA-150 in RGB ( 56 subs @300s ).  It's not as dramatic as Omega Centauri in size and star numbers but it contains a lot of nice colorful stars.\r\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\r\nTom",
