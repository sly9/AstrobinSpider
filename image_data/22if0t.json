    "description": "This object is popular for a reason.  The intricate structures in Ha and Sii really pop out from the background and fainter Oiii signal.  \r\n\r\nIt took me over a month to gather the data for this image, due to a combination of very poor transparency/seeing, and spending time on other targets for a while.  I usually aim for a roughly equal number of sub-exposures with each filter, but in this case it was taking so long to gather the Oiii and Sii data due to sky conditions that I just processed what I had.  Thus, this is 5 hours of Ha, almost 4 hours of Oiii, and 2 1/2 hours of Sii.  Having said that, this object has perhaps the strongest Sii signal I've yet gathered, making it easy to generate a balanced image.",
