    "description": "Deer Lick Group (NGC 7331 and Co.) imaged with the 250mm f4.0 Lacerta PhotoNewton and ZWO ASI183MM Pro camera. This image took two years to finish: the luminance data was acquired  in September-October 2019, while RGB and H-alpha taken over several nights in September 2020. This season was especially bad for imaging with unstable weather and lots of smoke from forest fires. At some point I was not sure if I will be able to finish it this year, but it still worked out somehow ...\r\n\r\nThe luminance data was taken in a series of 10s, 240s and 300s exposures. and was used to produce this B&W image from last year: https://www.astrobin.com/l9dtdl \r\nThe individual RGB exposures were 300 s long at camera gain 53, and H-alpha data was collected in a series of 600 s exposures at gain 110. The H-alpha data was blended with R band data to highlight star-forming regions in the spiral arms of NGC 7331.\r\n\r\nExposure details:\r\nL: 51x300s (Gain 0, bin 1x1)\r\nL: 7x240s (Gain 0, bin 1x1)\r\nL: 180x10s (Gain 200, bin 1x1)\r\nR: 40x300s (Gain 53, bin 1x1)\r\nG: 44x300s (Gain 53, bin 1x1)\r\nB: 26x300s (Gain 53, bin 1x1)\r\nHa: 12x600s (Gain 110, bin 1x1)\r\nTotal exposure: 16.4 hours",
