    "description": "Another Ha image of IC1805. I thought it would be nice to share a partial work while working on a bigger project. I had a couple of clear nights and got a chance to test my new rig with different settings. The result presented here is an integration of 80 subs with attention to FHWM values. Surprisingly, there was not much of a difference in the resolution between integrations of 30 and 80 subs, at least not as much as I expected, however the noise droped down to some degree and the final result looked a bit more clear.",
