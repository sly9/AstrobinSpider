    "description": "I've been trying my hand at Astrophotography for almost a year now.  Lots of sleepless nights and money has been spent.  I am rewarded with awe for our universe every night though, and I am starting to get some decent images.  \r\n\r\nLast night, I imaged the Andromeda Galaxy, our nearest galactic neighbor.  This was the first \"object\" I imaged during my first night of astrophotography on October 15, 2018.  \r\n\r\nThe scope I used last night is a far cry from the old soviet 300mm Tair 3 lens I used for my first photographs, but that old lens hooked me.  I am now pretty much addicted. \r\n\r\nAnyway, here is a shot of the core of Andromeda.",
