    "description": "Wow, I have been sitting on this image for quite some time. The LRGB image was so much easier- after all, it is the Trifid, everyone knows how it should look in LRGB. In SHO though? That was a much tougher question. Spent a lot of time trying to balance everything within this image. Tried to be a bit more colorful in my narrowband processing but not going full rainbow (I even included a little green!)\r\n\r\nThis isn't done too often in SHO, but I hope it breaths some life into the target!",
