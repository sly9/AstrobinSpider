    "description": "About to make some tweaks and upgrade the camera on the RH 200 [to a 16200 chip] so working through the test data I have accumulated - here we have a look at the Rosette Nebula in narrow band.  The speed of this scope is great and even though short of a few subs I have been able to generate a tidy image with <8hrs data.\r\nThe object lends itself to detail so have focused on that while keeping the overall image as clean and tidy as possible.\r\nHope you enjoy.",
