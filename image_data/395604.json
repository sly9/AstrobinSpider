    "description": "The Elephant's Trunk Nebula (also known as vdB 142) is a dark, concentrated globule of interstellar dust and is part of the much larger gas region IC 1396. It is located in the constellation Cepheus about 2400 light-years away from our home. The nebula got its name from the dark patch with the bright rim that resembles the trunk of an elephant. The overall length of the dusty cloud is over 20 light-years and is a nursery for several young stars. The dense cloud surface is illuminated by a massive O-Type star (HD 206267) located in the upper left part of this view. The warm clouds surrounding HD 206267 form a sell-like arrangement with a diameter of around 80-130 light-years and are thought to be the remainder of the molecular cloud that gave birth O-Type star and the Tr37 star cluster associated with it. The entire IC1396 region (which cover a region in the night sky with an apparent width of more than 10 full moons) is estimated to have around 12.000 Solar masses (1 solar mass = 2 Ã— 10^30 kg).\r\n\r\nThis picture is a SHO combination with a total integration time of 20 hours. It is my first photo with data from all of the three most used narrowband filters: Ha, OIII and SII.",
