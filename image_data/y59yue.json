    "description": "I was lucky and very happy to be shorlisted for this second part of the contest, after the processing of NGC2736 Pencil Nebula.\r\n\r\nSo here is my version of this cottony spiral galaxy, located about 36 million light years away in the constellation Leo, and having the particularity of being surrounded by a gigantic bubble formed of dust and stars, probably torn off by gravity to other nearby galaxies!\r\n\r\nData provided by <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/gturgeon/\">Greg Turgeon </a>\r\n12h30 exposures with :\r\nPlanewave CDK 17\r\n10 Micron GM3000 mount\r\nFLI ML16803 camera with Chroma LRGB filters\r\n\r\nThanks again to Greg for this contest, a great sharing experience!\r\nThanks again also to all he judges who examine our versions!",
