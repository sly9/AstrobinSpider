    "description": "This object is a bright emission nebula located in the southern sky constellation of Scorpius, over 5,000 light-years away.  A number of open star clusters are present in the image, the most prominent being Pismis 24.  \r\n\r\nDr. Paris Pismis was an Armenian-Mexican female astronomer.  Among many other accomplishments, she compiled the Pismis catalogue of 22 open clusters and 2 globular clusters in the southern hemisphere.  She was the first professional astronomer in Mexico and has been recognized as the most influential person in establishing Mexicoâ€™s importance in astronomy research.\r\n\r\nThe Pismis 24 cluster is seen just above the bright yellow emission region towards the center of the nebula.  The other open clusters are clouded by dust and are much more easily seen in X-ray images of this object.\r\n\r\nThis narrowband image is dominated by Ha signal, as in most narrowband images, but this object also contains a relatively large amount of SII signal compared to most other emission nebula.\r\n\r\nThe Lobster nickname makes sense to me - I can sort of see a lobster in there.  This nebula also has the alternative name of the War and Peace Nebula, because in the infrared the bright central area resembles a dove and the area above it resembles a skull.  I had a tough time seeing dove and skull images clearly in the internet infrared images I examined of this object.  It is interesting to me that this alternative name has become so popular.\r\n\r\nThe declination of this object, a bit lower than -34 degrees, makes it a difficult object to image for many of us in the northern hemisphere.",
