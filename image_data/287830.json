    "description": "I have had the chance to use quite a bit of equipment over the years ... this image was taken with a real 14.5\" f/9 RCOS with ion milled optics.  The camera was a QSI 8300 with Astrodon filters.  Standard LRGB  with H-a added.  LUM = 9 X 900  1 X 1,  RGB = 9 X 900 2 X 2,  H-alpha = 5 X 3600 1 X 1.\r\nTaken in the early summer with very good seeing conditions from my home observatory in Foresthill, CA.",
