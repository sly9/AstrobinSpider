    "description": "The shark nebula in Cepheus.\r\n\r\nI managed to capture this before it is gone for the season. We had a bunch of clear nights this winter and This was one of the Cepheus constellation targets ( along with VDB152 ) that I have always wanted to image.  This was shot from my little observatory at Pontotoc (Bortle 2 skies)\r\n\r\nAnother tough target to image due to the fact that it is mostly made up of Dark dust and few pockets of reflection nebulae.  The \"Sharp\" spans about 15 light year  . I love this target for its colorful array of blue/gold stars in the field.\r\n\r\nL - 44x600s\r\nR-12x600s\r\nG-12x600s\r\nB-12x600s",
