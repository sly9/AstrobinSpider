    "description": "During our the treatments in progress, we still present an image made during the tests and settings for the set-up and so not totally completed but that we like and would like to share with you:\r\n \r\nAround NGC-2020...\r\nIn the Great Magellanic Cloud (a companion of our Milky Vor), in the constellation of The Sea bream, many nebulae and clusters dot the sky.\r\nWe chose to image the very rich region around NGC-2020 and NGC 2014 and NGC-2030, 2032,2035, and 2040. This very rich region is located about 170,000 light years away.\r\n·         NGC 2020 and 2014: The image reveals two fiery clouds of gas: NGC 2014 (left at the top) is irregular in shape and its neighbour (to his right), NGC 2020, is round and blue. These shapes are sculpted by powerful stellar winds of very hot newly born stars. The Large Magellanic Cloud is also the seat of many regions with bursts of star formation9 .\r\nFor NGC 2020, a single bright and very hot star seems to have begun this process, creating a cavity that seems to be surrounded by a bubble-shaped structure. The bluish color of this nebula is created by the radiation of the star Brey 48, a star of the type Wolf-Rayet10 very hot that ionizes oxygen .\r\n·         NGC 2032 and NGC 2035, NGC 2030 and NGC 2040: these nebulae are part of a Nebulae and Star Complex, HII and star-forming regions. You could see the skull of a gaunt bird...\r\nThere are also clusters:\r\n·         NGC 2004: a very young globular cluster with short-term variables.\r\n·         NGC 2011: an open cluster\r\n·         NGC 2021: an open cluster associated with cloudiness\r\n·         NGC 2053: another open cluster",
