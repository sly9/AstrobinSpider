    "description": "This image is a screw up on my part.  My intent was to have the Cresent and Soap Bubble in the same frame.  The Soap Bubble is so faint, it did not show on my sub-exposures.  It wasn't until I did a quick process to see what I had that I found the Bubble was cut in half.  Drats!!\r\nRather that waste the 25 hours of exposure that I invested,  I just cropped into the top left corner of the frame.  The luminance was made from Ha and OIII combined into the SHO.\r\nOn a good note, this is the extreme upper edges of my frame.  The stars are all nice and round..yeaa\r\n\r\n22 x 300 SII\r\n113 x 300 OIII\r\n132 x 300 Ha",
