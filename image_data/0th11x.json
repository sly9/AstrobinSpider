    "description": "I posted an SHO Hubble palette rendition of these data last week. This is a reprocessing of those data with three different NB natural color approaches.\r\n\r\nVersion A uses a PI Pixel Math formula published by Arturas Medvedevas.\r\n\r\nR: iif (Ha>0.15, ha, (Ha*0.8) + (OIII*0.2))\r\nG: iif (Ha>0.5, 1-(1-OIII) * (1-(Ha-0.5)), OIII * (Ha+0.5))\r\nB: iif (OIII>0.1, OIII, (Ha*0.3) + (OIII*0.2))\r\n\r\nVersion B uses a Pixel Math formula published by Steve Milne.\r\n\r\nR: 0.5Ha + 0.5SII\r\nG: 0.15Ha + 0.85OIII\r\nB: OIII\r\n\r\nVersion C use my Pixel Math formula. My version uses linear Ha, SII, OIII channels in Pixel Math and stretches the resulting image with the RGB channels unlinked.\r\n\r\nR: SII + (Ha*0.5)\r\nG: (OIII + SII) *2\r\nB: OIII\r\n\r\nFinally, I have also include an HOO rendition (Version D) and my original SHO rendition (Version E) for comparison.\r\n\r\nWhat version do you like the best?\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Thank you to everyone that spent the time to consider and comment on these various approaches to creating a more natural color look to narrowband emission nebula data. In tallying the result of those analyses and comments I found that there are nearly as many opinions on what works best as there were options offered. I think that this result might be further evidence of the strong, independent thinking of our community of astrophotographers. No herd mentality here at Astrobin. Thank you all.",
