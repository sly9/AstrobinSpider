    "description": "I gathered the data for this image between January-March. NGC 1579 is know as the Northern Trifid because of its resemblance to M20, The Trifid Nebula. This one isn't captured nearly as often but I find it be quite interesting. The area is known as SH2-222. The reddish center is not caused by excited hydrogen gas like the Trifid Nebula. It is caused by light from a massive young star that is scattered and turned red by the surrounding dust.",
