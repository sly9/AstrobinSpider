    "description": "The area of nebulosity surrounding the bright star, Lambda Centauri, is generally known as the \"Running Chicken Nebula\". I am sure that I am not alone in saying that the image of the running chicken escapes me, even on wider field images. Nevertheless, it is a grand area of activity with the hydrogen gas glowing brightly under the influence of radiation from nearby stars.\r\n\r\nFor this image I decided to make a feature of Lambda Centauri by placing it in the centre of the field. I think that it makes for a nice contrast between the blue/white star and the rich area of red and glowing nebulosity surrounding it. Also captured in this image is the planetary nebula PK294-00.1 which is lurking in the bottom right hand corner.\r\n\r\nDuring the capture of data for this image, I was also running simultaneous data acquisition project with a Canon 60Da piggy backed on top of the TSA120/QSI camera combination. The 60Da was capturing data through a Tak FSQ106 OTA. Click on the link below to view the wider field image taken of this area with the 60Da.\r\n\r\nI trust that you enjoy the view and thank you for looking.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/o0l5f5/B/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/o0l5f5/B/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
