    "description": "* Image acquisition by: The Liverpool Telescope. \r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* Distance: 60 Mly.\r\n\r\nNGC 4051 is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation of Ursa Major at a distance of 60 million light years from Earth.\r\n\r\nThis galaxy is classified as a Seyfert type which means its nuclear region produces large amounts of energy and can vary on short timescales, making it a very bright object. Radio observations of this galaxy show a jet of material being ejected toward us. It seems the X-ray emissions were observed for the last time in 1998.\r\n\r\nNGC 4051 contains a supermassive black hole, with a mass of 1.73 million solar mass, in its core producing large amount of energy. The reason for this activity could be due to the gravitation interaction of the nearby galaxy NGC 4013.\r\n\r\nNGC 4051 has been studied in detail in an attempt to fully understand Seyfert, which astronomers estimate represents 10% of all galaxies.\r\n*",
