    "description": "There were plenty of clear skies in September so astrophotography became almost a routine every day. I took so many photos that I didnâ€™t notice that more than a thousand pictures were taken during the nights. During preprocessing, I was wondering if the computer could handle that amount and finally the averaged version was completed in just half a day. The processing took a few days, which I was a little afraid of, because at first I somehow didn't like the structure of the object, but during the last couple of settings I somehow liked this region.",
