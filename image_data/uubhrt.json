    "description": "Steve and I have been excited by the quality of the data rolling in over the last few weeks as we imaged M51.  The challenge with this image has been knowing when to stop tweaking, especially when choosing the over all colour balance and how best to represent the hot blue stars.  As is my style, I've tried for a natural feel, one that is not over sharpened or over 'PixInsight-ed HDRMultiscale-ed'.  I have uploaded the full frame as well as a central crop.\r\n\r\nImaged between 23 Feb and 28 March.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Steve Minle & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
