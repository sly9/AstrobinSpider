    "description": "Last night there was a big hole in the sky above Orion for about an hour or so. I looked up in Stellarium what's there to see. I decided to shoot the two star clusters M35 and NGC2158. They look very nice together. The big one is blue and the little one is far away and red. Stars are very forgiven even with cirrus clouds. A little bit more time would have been nice but it's better than nothing.",
