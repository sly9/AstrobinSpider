    "description": "Following a few weeks of rain, clouds and dust, I managed to collect enough data over 4 nights to process this image of the mysterious Black Eye Galaxy :-)\r\nThis is also the first data set acquired using the Voyager control software from Starkeeper. I was searching for a couple of years for a way to integrate the tracking of my MYT mount, the camera control and the focusing tools of TheSkyX, with the guiding and dithering capabilities of PHD2 using the Starlight Xpress SXV-AO-LF Adaptive Optics. Voyager is doing the job perfectly, highly recommended!",
