    "description": "NGC 6826 - \"The Blinking Eye\" Planetary Nebula, Hubble Space Telescope\r\n\r\nRGB image\r\nData acquisition: Hubble Legacy Archive, NASA\r\nData processing: Rudy Pohl\r\n\r\nWhat is a planetary nebula?\r\n\r\nA planetary nebula is created when a star blows off its outer layers after it has run out of fuel to burn. These outer layers of gas expand into space, forming a nebula which is often the shape of a ring or bubble. About 200 years ago, William Herschel called these spherical clouds planetary nebulae because they were round like the planets. At the center of a planetary nebula, the glowing, left-over central part of the star from which it came can usually still be seen.\r\n\r\nNGC 6826's eye-like appearance is marred by two sets of blood-red \"fliers\" that lie horizontally across the image. The surrounding faint green \"white\" of the eye is believed to be gas that made up almost half of the star's mass for most of its life. The hot remnant star (in the center of the green oval) drives a fast wind into older material, forming a hot interior bubble which pushes the older gas ahead of it to form a bright rim. (The star is one of the brightest stars in any planetary.) NGC 6826 is 2,200 light- years away in the constellation Cygnus. The Hubble telescope observation was taken Jan. 27, 1996 with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2.\r\n\r\n(Technical information from NASA)",
