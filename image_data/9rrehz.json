    "description": "I have posted an image of the Wall taken with the FSQ 106  with .6x reducer and one taken with the TOA 130, which this is a  crop from.  While many folks seem to think the FSQ image is better, I feel otherwise, and post this close in FOV to support my feelings.  I find this region of the NA nebula to be fascinating, with almost unlimited pgotographic potential",
