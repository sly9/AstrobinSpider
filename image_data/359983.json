    "description": "The Cocoon Nebula (designated IC5146) is a stellar nursery, where new stars are being born. The centre star, which is lighting up the whole nebula, was formed only about 100 thousand years ago. It’s about 4000 lightyears away and is about 15 lightyears across.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of a bright emission nebula, where hydrogen gas is being energised by the bright new stars, and a dark nebula, formed of dust, which weaves through it and obscures the light. In fact the dark nebula seems to cocoon the glowing red emission nebula and actually extends much further away forming a tail. The new stars form a cluster, which has the name Collinder 470.\r\n\r\nAmazingly, it wasn’t discovered until 1899, by a British clergyman and well-known astronomer, called Thomas Espin. In 1900 Max Wolf, usually noted as the co-discoverer, took the first photograph of it.",
