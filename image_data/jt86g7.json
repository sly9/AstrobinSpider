    "description": "Located in the constellation, Cassiopeia, the Bubble Nebula was created by stellar winds from the massive, hot star, SAO 20575. The bubble shape is made visible because the energy from the star causes the matter in surrounding molecular cloud to glow. \r\n\r\nI collected the data for this image over a month-long period in December 2020 and January 2021. I enjoyed pretty good seeing, with nearly all of the data ranging from HFR 2.1 to HFR 2.7, good quality for my WO FLT132 and ZWO ASI1600MM Pro combination. This is an SHO rendition with standard Hubble Palette color assignment.",
