    "description": "This is an SHO image of the faint N70 superbubble located on the outskirts of the Large Magellanic Cloud.  Taken with narrowband filters, it has signatures across all three (Ha, SII, OIII).  It's not small - about 300 light years across, but we have to remember it's in another galaxy which is so cool!  About 5.75 hrs worth of data across all filters.",
