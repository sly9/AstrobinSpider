    "description": "While making and uploading a few posters the other days, I failed to summarize my planetary images, but here it is. Nothing stunning just to round up and \"lock down\" 2020. The title refers to the fact that my gear does not reach out any further than ancient astronomy. They knew Mercury, I never saw it. Actually, some ancient knowledge may have got lost.\r\n\r\nChanging subjects,\r\nMost people here in my village are elderly. The hostesses in our only bar, \"The Pension Killer\", are all over sweet 75. No place for me to go at 65 years of age. I'd get raped as I'd enter through the door. The name of the street is \"Orion doori\", meaning Orion Street. This is not directly related to the constellation of Orion, but to a local beer brand which adopted Orion's belt stars for naming their beer. In that bar, however, beer is considered a soft drink.",
