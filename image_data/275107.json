    "description": "The great spirals, with their enormous radial velocities and insensible proper motions, apparently lie outside our (Solar) system - Edwin Hubble, first page of his Ph.D. Dissertation 1917\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNGC 4725 (centre)/ NGC 4747 (upper left) /NGC 4747 (lower right) and PGC86434 (upper right)  constitute a beautiful quadrupel of galaxies belonging to the Coma-Sculptor galaxy Cluster. The red K-star Hip 62778 at the left border is a true binary star. \r\n\r\nThe data for this picture were collected  in june/july 2016.\r\nThe short nights during this period did not allow for any  visual observations or any other additional LRGB  targets during this time.\r\nThe nights with moon were used for the Ha data. \r\nAs I am still lacking knowledge and experience (and time) a significant amount of time  was necessary for my processing  .  Back in Oktober - having first finished the LRGB part of the processing - I decided to rework the picture and incorperate the Ha data which I originale disgarded.  The result is the picture displayed here.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I was just not able to finish the picture in a seasonally more adequate time but maybe some of you might still enjoy this beautiful constellation of galaxies even late into the year.\r\n\r\nBy now I generated more data of different objects  which I am planning to process and publish here  in the next weeks/months - unfortunately most of them will be of season as well. \r\n\r\nBeside the aesthetic aspect of these galaxies there is a wealth of interesting astronomy happening here.\r\nMaybe this site is not the place to put it, but I would like to  start a site next year with more information about the really exciting astronomical aspects underlying this and other pictures to follow.",
