    "description": "IC 342 is a mixed spiral galaxy 13 million light years away in the constellation of Camelopardalis.  It was discovered in 1892 by William Denning.  It is sometimes named the 'Hidden Galaxy' because it is located near the galactic equator meaning that it needs to be viewed through the stars and dust of our Milky Way.  This also affects the colour of the object when photographed.\r\n\r\nIC 342 was photographed between 8 September and 18 October 2020 from a rig in Spain that is privately owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me.  \r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC 140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 24 x 1200s \r\nLum: 60 x 600s\r\nRed: 48 x 300s\r\nGreen 48 x 300s\r\nBlue: 48 x 300s\r\n\r\nA total of 30 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nProcessing; Steve Milne\r\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson",
