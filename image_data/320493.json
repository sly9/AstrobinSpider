    "description": "This is my first image of Andromeda that I'm happy with. I did some mistakes in the beginning of processing in Pixinsight but I'm still happy with the overall result.

I hope you still like it.\r\n\r\nCamera Canon EOS 40Da\r\nLens: Canon EF 400 mm f5.6 L\r\nMount: Skywatcher Star advanturer\r\nGuiding: Orion Starshoter with 50 mm scope",
