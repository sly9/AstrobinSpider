    "description": "A nice surprise was some clear sky during the new moon, it appears to be a race for photons during such times... unsure how long the stretch could go I thought to shoot another bright target while Orion is still around.  Luckily a few more days were surprisingly available and I was able to get enough data to finish.\r\n\r\nThe ground was covered in snow, and it was very apparent in the sky how much the ground light was reflected back up causing higher light pollution than normal.  As the snow melted over the next few days I could see how it affected the images. \r\n\r\nThere are quite a bit of neat details in the center area that are fairly bright that need some HDR processing to bring out.\r\n\r\nThanks for viewing!",
