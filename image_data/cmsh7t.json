    "description": "This is one of my favorite areas in the sky, located in the well known star cluster The Hyades. The two most prominent objects are Sh2-239 in the lower left, and NGC 1555, known as Hind's Variable Nebula or Sh2-238, in the upper right. Both of these feature Herbig-Haro objects. Embedded in the molecular cloud LDN 1551, Sh2-239 contains HH 102. Hind's Variable Nebula is also known as HH 155. As a variable nebula, it can periodically change due to variations in the triple star system T Tauri that illuminates it.",
