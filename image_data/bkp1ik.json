    "description": "So we have Friday - so I'll treat my astrophoto little \"lighter way\" ;)\r\n\r\nLast time when I observed Mars it's remind me great book and film \"Martian\" (book from Andy Weier - great one, I recommend :) )\r\nAnd I thought - what was the path of journey of main character - Mark Watney - from HAB in Acidalia Planitia to Schiaparelli Crater? And if we will be able to register some of the details on his journey path using our amateur telescopes.\r\n\r\nSo Mark had his base in HAB on Acidalia Planitia - big plain on Mars between high Tharsis regio and Arabia Terra. On our pictures it's visible like a significant dark spot on the top of Mars - currently covered by blue clouds from water evaporated from northern polar cap.\r\n\r\nBefore he started journey to Mav, Mark jumped to Ares Vallis - big outflow channel below Acidalia Planitia and also not so far from Valles Marineris - and also place of landing PAthfinder probe.\r\n\r\nLater Mark is travelling through Acidalia Planitia, big outflow channel - Mawrth Vallis, between big three craters on Arabia Terra -  Trouvelot, Rutherford and Becquerel (visible as a small dark dots on picture between \"stars\" number 4 & 5\r\nFinally through Terra Meridiani he is reaching Schiaparelli crater where he found MAV spaceship prepared for another mission :)",
