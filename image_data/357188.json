    "description": "I did this area along with M8 a few years ago and wanted to revisit it at a longer focal length. This image has some Ha blended into the red channel but none in the L as it didn't really add much.   I again used Astro Pixel Processor which really speeds up the stacking.   I've also quit taking flats as APP is pretty good at removing vignetting.   L 22x200s , RGB 12x200s 2x2 binned, Ha 8x500s.",
