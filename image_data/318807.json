    "description": "Before I went outside tonight I decided that I would try and image Stock 2 because I've never\r\nimaged it and because there was an almost half Moon up and I wanted to pick a target that\r\nthe Moon light would not affect that much.   I figured an open cluster would fit the bill.  \r\nThis is a nice open cluster that is not compact but instead is scattered over a large part\r\nof the sky.  Please enjoy my first image of Stock 2.",
