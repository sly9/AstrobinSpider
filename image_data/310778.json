    "description": "The area in Cassiopeia contains a lot of well-known and lesser-known emission nebulae and dark dust lanes. One of the objects, not far from the star Ruchbah is Sh2-187 and the surrounding dust of LDN1317. I think it is a neat little gem that is often overlooked and so Iâ€™m happy that I was able to capture it during the past weeks. This little star nursery lies about 4700 ly away from us.",
