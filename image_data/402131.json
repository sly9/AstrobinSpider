    "description": "Images from the following two scopes (piggybacked) contributed to this image:\r\nAG12+ASI1600MM at .70 asec/pix\r\nTV127is+ASI183MM at .75 asec/pix. \r\nThey were all registered to the best Ha image taken on the AG12.\r\nUsing L (synthetic from L+ RGB) from the TV NP127is refractor effectively eliminates the spikes from the AG12.\r\n\r\nImaged on nights of 3/28/2019, 3/29/2019, 3/30/2019, 4/14/2019, 4/15/2019, 4/16/2019.\r\n\r\nThe Cat's Eye Nebula or NGC6543, is a relatively bright planetary nebula in the northern constellation of Draco, discovered by William Herschel on February 15, 1786. It was the first planetary nebula whose spectrum was investigated by the English amateur astronomer William Huggins, demonstrating that planetary nebulae were gaseous and not stellar in nature. Structurally, the object has had high-resolution images by the Hubble Space Telescope revealing knots, jets, bubbles and complex arcs, being illuminated by the central hot planetary nebula nucleus (PNN). It is a well-studied object that has been observed from radio to X-ray wavelengths.\r\nThe Cat's Eye Nebula is structurally a very complex nebula, and the mechanism or mechanisms that have given rise to its complicated morphology are not well understood. The central bright part of the nebular consists of the inner elongated bubble (inner ellipse) filled with hot gas. It, in turn, is nested into a pair of larger spherical bubbles conjoined together along their waist. The waist is observed as the second larger ellipse lying perpendicular to the bubble with hot gas.\r\n(Wikipedia)",
