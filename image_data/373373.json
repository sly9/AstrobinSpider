    "description": "This is a new image of the Flaming Star and Tadpoles with new data. I had some data from last year, but it was shot in worse conditions. I was not happy with the old rendition and the dragon was not visible in narrowband.\r\nI blended some of the old Ha into the new mix though.\r\n\r\nThe final result is a combination of LRGB + HOO. All the data I shot this year came through the SkyWatcher 72ED. You can see around the blue stars that the scope does not put all the waves in the same place, not to mention that blue is focused far away from red. However, the resolution is pretty sharp.\r\n\r\n I put the LRGB image for reference too.\r\n\r\nIn total I shot ~8h with the 130PDS and 7.5h with the Canon 300 F4 lens on the AZ-EQ5 last year for Ha +\r\nwith the 72ED on the EQ6-R this year:\r\n~100x120s each LRGB\r\n~8h of Ha\r\n~13h of OIII\r\n\r\nSumming them up, I ended with about 50h in total.",
