    "description": "I set up to take this widefield timelapse on the very humid morning of July 21st, 2017.   After about 20 minutes of exposures I lost the rest due to dew on the lens.   I was pleasantly surprised looking back at the images that there was visible aurora shimmering in the background.  This is an extremely rare sight below 45 degrees latitude.  I did not see this visually, and was otherwise occupied sitting around a campfire burning off the right side of the frame.   You can probably notice the \"toss another log on the fire\" moment.   \r\n\r\nThe camera was set up on a grass covered sand dune looking north up the coast of Lake Michigan toward the small costal towns of Arcadia and Frankfort, MI.    Through the magic of post processing the reality of the scene comes alive with aurora and skyglow dancing in the upper atmosphere.   I love this FOV.   It covers from the Big Dipper to Andromeda and everything in between.   Satellites, airplanes, and shipping lanes, oh my!\r\n\r\nThis animated image is a 20 minute rocking segment of timelapse from just after midnight.   Shot on a Canon 6D through a Rokinon 14mm @ f/2.8, ISO3200 using 30 second exposures on a fixed tripod.    GIFs are not known for fidelity, and this suffers a bit with only 256 colors.   \r\n\r\nEnjoy... something different anyway!    ",
