    "description": "Subject: M27: A planetary nebula in the constellation Vulpecula, located about 1360 light-years from earth.\r\n\r\nCapture notes: A straightforward narrowband capture. S-ii was captured over two different nights due to some clouds coming in the first night, but otherwise all lights were taken during a long run of extremely clear summer nights in Seattle (making up for last winter I suppose).\r\n\r\nProcessing notes: I used tone maps to stretch the individual narrowband channels, combined them into an RGB image and then applied a synthetic luminance made by integrating the original narrowband channels. My main concern with this image is whether I went overboard with deconvolution ... most of the detail can be attributed to applying local histogram equalization to the luminance.",
