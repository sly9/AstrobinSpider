    "description": "This area is part of larger nebular complex called North America nebula, and is usually referred as Cygnus Wall, because it is located in Cygnus constellation and resembles this wall dividing darker and brighter regions of the sky and exhibits most concentrated star formation in the region. This so called wall stretches for around 20 light years and is located around 1500 light years away from us. Light in this image was emitted by Hydrogen (alpha part of spectrum) and double ionized Oxygen and combined using special technique for dual filter color images (see more info for details)\r\n\r\nWhat makes astronomy great is that it allows your mind to be free and roam through the sky so your imagination goes wild and starts seeing various shapes. This way we got constellation names, nebula, galaxy, star cluster names, no exception with this part of the sky. What I noticed were two figures and the top left part of the image- a witch flying on a broom and a woman with her hair flailing behind her. Can you spot them? What do YOU see in this image?\r\n\r\nFirst image completed during start of last season, most of the data was gathered without astrodark, so I am super impressed with the way this turned out. As always, I'm blown away by amount of color variations you can get out of bicolor data and makes me wonder why do I even have SII filter :)\r\n\r\nThis is also the first image I finished processing after my daughter was born, so I dedicate it to her.",
