    "description": "The picture is rarely found in this composition, though this combination, I think, looks quite attractive.\r\n The OIII-signal is very weak and was not visible on the Canon image, it comes 100% from the ASI camera.\r\nThe small round Ha-nebula with the blue OIII spot at the bottom center is LAN 21, a PN.\r\n The two very small Ha nebulae west of Sh2-88 are LBN137 and LBN138.",
