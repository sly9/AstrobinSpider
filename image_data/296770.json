    "description": "This shows the output of the APP program after the automatic mosaic process. (I am a Beta team member  https://www.astropixelprocessor.com) APP finds all overlaps (i used 15% for the SGP Frame and Mosaic wizard settings) and positions and the right orientation and distortion correction! I loaded a masterdark, bad pixel map and masterflat together with all the single light frames. Each panel is a single 15 minute H-alpha (7nm) exposure with QHY16200 CCD/ Esprit 100 f5.5 refractor)\r\n\r\nThis version is downscaled to 12.5% (Full scale is >600 Megapixels), after optimisation in Astro Pixel Processor I will upload lager versions. Each APP run takes 6 hours.",
