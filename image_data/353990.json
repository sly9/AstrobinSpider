    "description": "Also categorized as PN G086.1+5.4, this faint planetary nebula in Cygnus was discovered by R. Weinbergerger in 1977, though I have yet to find the discovery paper. There is not a lot on this rarely imaged PN. It has a very low surface brightness, and so it is obscured by the dense Cygnus starfield and Ha nebulosity and is near reflection nebula VDB 134.",
