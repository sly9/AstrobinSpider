    "description": "One of the neatest things in the night sky, but for me at 53° N the highest it gets at it's peak in the spring is about 22° above the horizon.  This combined with southern tress makes this target not possible to do from my home.  This is a telescope live data set that I have used to create this final image.  I found this a hard target to processes, but I'm just happy to have had the chance to do it.",
