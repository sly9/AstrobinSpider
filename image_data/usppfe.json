    "description": "I finally have a satisfying edit of M81. I re-edited this image so many times, I couldn't tell you how many.\r\n\r\nBut this time, I feel like I finally got it right. Not too bright, not too saturated, not overcooked. Now I can finally move on to the next object lol.\r\n\r\nBy the way, not only can you see the Satellite dwarf irregular galaxy Holmberg IX above M81, but also a small patch of well defined Integrated Flux Nebula towards the top right of the image. This is no gradient or processing artefact, its IFN!\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think! I'm really excited about this one.",
