    "description": "This area is forming some of the largest stars we know of, and scientists aren't sure why. It is a region known as the Lobster Nebula and it houses the open star cluster Pismis 24 near its center -- a home to unusually bright and massive stars. The overall blue glow near the inner star forming region results from the emission of doubly ionized oxygen. This image is in false color, with the blue areas being rich in oxygen, and the more red areas being rich hydrogen. Stay tuned though, I have a true color image I will post on a later date! I have been working on it for quite some time, but can't the colors just the way I like them. I had similar issues with the above image, spending nearly 15 hours on editing with about half of that spent solely on getting the colors how I liked them. Overall, really happy with how dynamic this turned out. I understand it may be a bit for some, but if you can push an image to its max, why not? \r\n\r\nThanks for looking, clear skies :)",
