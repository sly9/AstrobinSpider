    "description": "I had initially attempted a deep image of NGC 7662, the Blue Snowball, a planetary nebula in the constellation Andromeda in 2009. What I assumed was a filter reflection turned out to be a legitimate halo, and I initially described the extra halo \"jet\" structure at that time. I added to this image in 2012 and decided to give it one last effort presently.\r\n\r\nImaging Camera: QSI640 wsg\r\nImaging Scope: 9.25\" Celestron Edge at F/7 (Halo and starfield), Meade LX200 at F/10 (PN Core)\r\nGuide Camera: SX Lodestar x 2, PHD2\r\nMount:Avalon M Uno\r\nFilters: Astrodon 3nm OIII, LRGB\r\nExposure:\r\nHalo data and starfield: 16 hours OIII 30 min subs binx2, three hours luminance 3 minute subs, one hour each RGB 1 minute subs bin x2\r\nCore data (Data from 2012): Two hours of 20-30sec LRGB and OIII subs were combined for the core of the nebula.\r\n\r\nCapture Program: APT\r\nProcessing: CCD Stack and PS CC.\r\nDate: 9/4 - 9/21/20\r\nLocation: My front driveway.
