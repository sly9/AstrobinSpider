    "description": "An older set I never got around to editing because I always thought it seemed a little boring when first opening it up in PI and giving it a few adjustments. Finally sat down with it though and really tried to make it special. One of my favorite narrowband images I've produced to date, very pleased with the colors more than anything. Still trying desperately to get away from the gold and cyan color schemes, even if they keep sucking me back in. At least this one is a nice change of pace in terms of colors",
