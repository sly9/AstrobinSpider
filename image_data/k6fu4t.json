    "description": "I FINALLY was able to finish this image--34 hours in this climate really means about 3 months.  The Ha and SII channels went pretty well, but the OIII gave me some trouble.  Conditions were not great and the data was at best fair (and that is being generous).  I probably shoud have collected more than 60 OIII subs, but my patience was at its end.\r\n\r\nI decided to bin the data 2x2 in software due to the noise in the OIII channel.  \r\n\r\nVersion R is a combination of about 9 hours FSQ 106 and 34 hours TOA 130 data.  I cropped the fish head out of my my FSQ Heart Nebula image and aligned it with the TOA Fihead, then combined 50-50.  So Version R has about 43 hours of data!  I think that is my record so far.",
