    "description": "The Ghost Nebula (designated Sh2-136, VdB 141) is a reflection nebula located in the constellation Cepheus.\r\n\r\nIt lies near the cluster NGC 7023. Looking at the adjacent image, the nebula's name is easily understood. The Ghost nebula is referred to as a globule (cataloged CB230) and over 2 light-years across. \r\n\r\nIt lies 1,470 light-years away from our planet.\r\n\r\nSource: Wikipedia\r\n\r\nI am still getting the hang of using an SCT. The stars are having rainbow colors, some of them at least, where blue blotches or red ones appear, which I couldn't figure out yet, not sure if it is the reducer, my collimation or guiding.\r\n\r\nI've collected some of the data from a darker site but most of it where from my balcony, where its FoV usually dictates my targets. I've reprocessed this from scratch more than I would normally, but I like the final outcome.\r\n\r\nAs always, comments and feedback are much appreciated!\r\n\r\nClear skies and stay safe!",
