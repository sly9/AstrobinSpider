    "description": "What started as an attempt to capture M31 through my 714mm FL ES 102 refractor + DSLR ended up becoming a 4 month long 5 panel project.\r\nAfter capturing 7 hours of the central part starting in Sept 2018 , I succumbed to the desire to capture the galaxy in its entirety.  I then set out to capture 4 additional sections for a mosaic. I got about 90 mins each of the galaxy extremities before the bad weather spell in Northern CA put a stop to further imaging. I was left with needing two more sections when a break in Jan allowed me to capture 45mins each of the remaining sections. Unfortunately it was not a dark site and M31 was already low on the horizon ~30 deg. \r\n\r\nNot one to leave a project unfinished, I've processed the image dealing with the uneven integration on the different panels as best as I could.\r\n\r\nThrown into this is also ~4hours of H-alpha (through DSLR) from my suburban light polluted backyard. This is for the central panel only.",
