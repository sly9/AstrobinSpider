    "description": "This is about 13 hours on the Eagle Nebula, with a custom channel mix to try to get closer to a Blue/Gold modified SHO palette. This was processed using starnet+ to allow for tone mapping, with a very short stack of RGB stars added in at the end. I am reasonably happy with the result. I am also really liking the extra details I am able to start to see with these longer integration times too.",
