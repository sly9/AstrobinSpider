    "description": "Following last image attempt to combine two sets of data acquired in different time and using different setups, this image is a combination of two different datasets with the same scope (Takahashi FSQ106ED4) but different cameras (QSI683 and ZWO ASI1600):\r\nSet1: Ha used as Luminance, 07Nov2020 about 4.6 hours, QSI683 (see image Revision B)\r\nand\r\nSet2: HaO3O3 used as RGB, 04 and 11Feb2019, ZWO ASI1600 (see image Revision C)\r\n\r\nThe end result (Revision A)  is a much better image than the older image, with smaller stars and better structural details, since the Ha data taken with the QSI683 during a night with very good seeing was richer and smoother.\r\n\r\nMouse over Revisions B or C to compare :-)",
