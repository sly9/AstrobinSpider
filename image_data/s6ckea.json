    "description": "By far my most challenging edit to date.....\r\n\r\nMessier 77 or M77, also known as NGC1068, is a barred spiral galaxy around 47 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Cetus.\r\n\r\nInitially identified as a nebula by the French astronomer Pierre Méchain in 1780, M77 is one of the largest galaxies in the Messier catalog. \r\n\r\nM77 is a prime example of a Seyfert galaxy, or a galaxy with an intensely active center that is obscured by gas and dust in visible light.\r\n\r\nThe data was captured by Adam Block at the Mount Lemmon Sky Center Observatory in Arizona, United States between November 2014 and January 2015 and comprises 24hrs of RGB integration.\r\n\r\nThis target was a lot more difficult to process than I initially expected, however, after a lot of trial and error, I’m relatively happy with the end result.",
