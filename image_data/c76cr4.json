    "description": "After accidentally capturing two images with Oval BA in the same location but 7 days apart, I have been attempting to capture data of Jupiter at the same orientation over roughly 7 day periods.\r\n\r\nI was lucky with the first three captures, which are all exactly 7 days apart. My luck with clouds ran out after this however, so the spacing for the final two images is slightly longer (8 and 9 days respectively). Variations in seeing and transparency also impacted the comparison, with the skies being increasingly hazy of late.\r\n\r\nNone-the-less, I feel extremely fortunate to have been able to capture this series, which now illustrates the relative changes in cloud patterns over a one month period.\r\n\r\nFeatures/changes of note:\r\n\r\n- The opening of the \"chimney\" above the GRS.\r\n\r\n- Changes in morphology of a dark brown raft in the bottom edge of the north polar region (beginning at the top-right edge of the image, then moving slowly left).\r\n\r\n- The sheer relative speed at which the bright outbreak in the North Tropical Zone (first visible in the image from 22nd August) moves around the planet.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
