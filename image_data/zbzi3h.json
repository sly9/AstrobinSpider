    "description": "This is the Lupus 3 - a little known dark cloud and brilliantly bright stellar nursery some 600 lights years away in the Southern Hemisphere constellation of Scorpius.\r\n\r\nThe intense radiation and stellar winds from the central stars have slowly cleared away the dust that originally would have concealed them leaving them to shine brightly and illuminate the surrounding area with a wonderful small area of reflection nebula.\r\n\r\nIt is thought our own sun formed in a similar star formation region more than four billion years ago.\r\n\r\nBeing only RGB with no luminance data,  I would've loved to get more time on this but with only two partially clear nights this new moon and cloud for the foreseeable future, the almost 9 hours I have will happily do.",
