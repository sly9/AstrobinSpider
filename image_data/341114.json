    "description": "Sh 2-261 is a faint emission nebula located in the constellation Orion. It is named after Harold and Charles Lower - father and son amateur astronomers who captured the nebula on a photographic plate in 1939. It is thought to be some 530 light years from Earth.\r\n\r\nThis is a combination of data acquired from remote imaging facilities in New Mexico (Deep Sky West) and Extremadura in Spain (e-EyE).  The DSW data were captured over several nights between 3 October and 20 November 2017.  The Spanish rig is jointly owned and operated with Barry Wilson.  Data from Spain were collected between 30 November 2017 and 4 April 2018.\r\n\r\nThis is an SHO (Hubble Palette) image:\r\n\r\nHa (DSW): 21 x 1800s\r\nHa (e-EyE): 21 x 1200s\r\n\r\nOIII (DSW): 12 x 1800s\r\nOIII (e-EyE): 19 x 1200s\r\n\r\nSII (DSW): 14 x 1800s\r\nSII (e-EyE): 19 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of  43.2 hours exposure.",
