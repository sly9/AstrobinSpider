The probable PN has not yet been spectroscopically confirmed, but there is no doubt about the nature of a PN.\r\n\r\nStDr20 (Aurore's Nebula) was discovered in February 2020 by Xavier Strottner and Marcel Drechsler of the team \"StDr\".\r\n\r\nStDr20 is extremely old, because it is very distant, extremely faint, but still 6' arcminutes large.\r\nEstimated age about 20000 years.",
