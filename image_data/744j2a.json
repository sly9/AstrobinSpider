    "description": "This was taken during the mercury transit of May 2016 using a Quark chromosphere.\r\nIt is made up from 30 panels captured at 1000 frames per panel stacked to best 12% each.\r\n\r\nYou can see Mercury as a black dot just right and down from the Sun's centre.\r\n\r\nFor some reason I had never created the mosaic from this data and only recently revisited this while cleaning up my astro data (A HUGE task in itself) .",
