    "description": "NGC 5139, also known as Omega Centauri, is the largest globular star cluster in our Milky Way Galaxy.  It contains about 10,000,000 stars (total solar mass equivalent of 4,000,000 solar masses), lies at a distance of 17,090 light-years, and is 150 light-years in diameter(almost the size of the full Moon).  While most globular clusters consist of stars of approximately the same age and composition, Omega Centauri consists of a diverse collection of stars of different ages and chemical composition.   Some astronomers believe that Omega Centauri may even be the core of a galaxy cannibalized by the Milky Way.  The core of Omega Centauri is so dense, it is estimated that the stars are only 0.1 light-years apart. \nThis data was taken with the TOA-150 at Deep Sky West-Chile, 81 subs LRGB @120s.\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\nTom",
