    "description": "45 minute animation taken this morning. I captured 10 sec video every 30 seconds.   I made errors during capture. My flats were wrong and I didnt set the histogram correctly. I THOUGHT I set it correctly but didnt notice the high clouds. When they left the area, the histogram became over exposed. Normally I use autohistogram in Firecapture and set to 75-80 and it will adjust the gain to keep the histogram stable.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcessed\r\nAS3\r\nIMPPG for deconvolution, sharpening and tone curves\r\nPixinsight : image container and process container to process all 90 frames with crop and image rotation\r\nPIPP to make .gif",
