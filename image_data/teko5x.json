    "description": "I was never satisfied with my TOA 130 M51.  It is a galaxy where incredibly subtle changes have major impacts on the image.  Brightness was the big one here--I continually had to notch it down as it crept upward.  And as I brought the brightness down (in ever so slight increments), the saturation would creep up--especially the Ha.  I was careful to avoid processing artifacts--especially from deconvolution.  The core needs work, but there, I think, there is not much more in the data.  The one aspect of the data set that is beyond help is the faint extensions of the galaxy and its companion.  I would need much more data to adequately portray the extensions as seen in deep images of M51.  That's a tough challenge at F7.7 with 5\"  scope in poor skies.   At least I picked it up a bit.  So until next time, after I improve my skills, this version will have to do.   The data, no doubt, has more to yield--except, perhaps, for the core and extensions.",
