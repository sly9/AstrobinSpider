    "description": "This is the IC5067 ionization front region of the Pelican Nebula.  It is an Ha/OIII bi-color image taken with my C14 Edge and reducer at a scale of about 0.5 arc-sec/pixel.  Color mapping was Red (Ha), Green (25%Ha/75%OIII), and Blue (OIII).  Separate RGB was captured for the star colors. Unfortunately, most of the exposures were taken under the bright Moon and hazy skies.  I was hoping to capture more subs, but so far August has been the month of nearly daily rain so I went ahead and processed what I had.\r\n\r\nAlso visible in the image are Herbig-Haro objects (protostar shock regions) HH555, 564, 565, 566, 567, and 568.  They can be identified by clicking on the yellow box/boxes available at: https://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr03/sb0308.html\r\n\r\nI also stumbled upon this interesting paper which presents four simulations of possible HH outflow: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/522365/fulltext/\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy.  Thanks for looking!",
