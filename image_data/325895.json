    "description": "The Tadpoles are a favourite of imagers and its easy to see why with abundant emission data and such a distinctive recognisable shapes!\r\n\r\nThis image is from e-Eye and its dark skies reveal delightful detail.  I have once again left a touch of green in the NB processing as I am finding it helps enrich the blues with a broader tonal range.\r\n\r\nFrom APOD: \"What's all of the commotion in the Tadpole nebula? Star formation. Dusty emission in the Tadpole nebula, IC 410, lies about 12,000 light-years away in the northern constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga). The cloud of glowing gas is over 100 light-years across, sculpted by stellar winds and radiation from embedded open star cluster NGC 1893. Formed in the interstellar cloud a mere 4 million years ago, bright newly formed cluster stars are seen all around the star-forming nebula. Notable near the image center are two relatively dense streamers of material trailing away from the nebula's central regions. Potentially sites of ongoing star formation in IC 410, these cosmic tadpole shapes are about 10 light-years long.\" \r\n\r\nImage acquisition: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson.  Processing: Barry Wilson.\r\n\r\nData for this image were captured between 30 November and 13 December 2017 \r\n\r\nC&Cs always welcome & thanks for looking.",
