    "description": "M 94, obtained over the last two weeks or so.  Fresh from the Universe.  The image was obtained as usual WITHOUT autoguiding.  Each sub was 10minutes long.  \r\n\r\nThe inner ring of M 94 is in the midst of star formation but no one is quite sure why.  Their is an outer ring and a debate is ongoing as to where it came from.\r\n\r\nM 94 is about 17 million light years from earth.  Do you suppose they are looking back at the Milky Way?  Its almost a certainty that they are or were.",
