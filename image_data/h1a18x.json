    "description": "I started collecting color for this faint reflection nebula during a few December nights of decent seeing. I was then lucky to see some clearings during January for the Luminance.\r\n\r\n\"VdB 47 is a reflection nebula associated with a visible emission in the constellation Taurus.\r\n\r\n It is a cloud of gas that surrounds the star HD 37387, an orange supergiant of spectral class K1Ib placed at a distance of 6500 light-years, at the inner edge of the Perseus Arm. \r\n\r\nThe nebula presents a markedly orange color due to the radiation of this star and has an effective temperature of 4500 Kelvin. The cloud may be associated with star-forming region which also includes the maser DG 68 and the source IRAS 05363 + 2317, along with some radio wave sources.\r\n\r\n Some astronomers identify VdB 47 with Sh2-243. In fact, the given coordinates in the Sharpless catalogue place SH2-243 almost at the same place. From Galaxymap: \"there is no visible nebulosity on this image, no known ionising stars in this direction, nor has anything been detected at radio frequencies. It is not clear whether this object actually exists\".\r\n\r\nThe same applies more or less to LBN 830. But some further research suggests, that probably VdB 47 = SH2-243 = LBN 830.\"",
