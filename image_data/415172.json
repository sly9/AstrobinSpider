    "description": "One of our local group neighbors, only 1.5 millions light years distant, this dwarf galaxy remarkably resembles one of our Magellanic Clouds.    It may be small but it is alive with bright blue giants, and star forming regions.  \r\n\r\nTo best capture the star forming clouds I shot both Ha and OIII to add to Red and Blue respectively.  I tried a different method for integrating the narrowband data with the broadband.  Using linear data in CCDStack, I first subtracted the mode of the narrowband image.  That reduced the background counts of the Ha for example, to near zero.  Then I added the result directly to the linear red.  Subtracting the background meant that I carried a minimal amount of the Ha noise over to the Red channel.  This produced a very bright red for the nebulae however.  Next time I will divide the Ha file by 2 or 3 before adding to the linear Red channel.  \r\n\r\nThe Ha and OIII data were also added to the Luminance channel.  I used Pixelmath and Filemath functions in CCDStack.  Non-linear processing was done in PS CC 2019.",
