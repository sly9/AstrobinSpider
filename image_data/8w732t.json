    "description": "M63 (NGC 5055) is the famous Sunflower galaxy in Canes Venatici.  It is of type SAbc and measures about 13' by 7',  not  including the faint outer star streams.\r\n\r\nMy Bortle 4/5 skies are not dark enough to pick up those outer star streams with the C11 Edge at f/7,  though I think I could detect them with my f/3.6 refractor.  I wish I could have shot this image from my dark site, but it's too icy and windy up on the mountain until May.\r\n\r\nThe core details and colors on this close-up turned out pretty good for a backyard image with modest light pollution.  I may have pushed the color saturation a bit too much in my excitement, so let me know in the comments if you think I should tone it down a bit.",
