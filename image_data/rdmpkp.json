    "description": "This might just be my new favorite Nebula. It's a stunningly beautiful reflection nebula in Orion with wonderful red hydrogen emissions from Barnard's Loop clouding the left of the frame.   \r\nIt's a target I've been dying to shoot this summer but the weather just wasn't having it. Then along came four incredible nights this week during the new moon and this is the result.",
