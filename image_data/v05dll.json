    "description": "NGC 4567 and NGC 4568 (nicknamed the Siamese Twins or the Butterfly Galaxies) are a set of spiral galaxies about 60 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo.  \r\nThese two galaxies are part of the Virgo cluster of galaxies. Although the two galaxies appear to be almost touching from our viewpoint, there is no sign of tidal filaments or distorted structure such as the type that is normally observed in gravitationally interacting galaxies.  Recent studies have indicated that they are in the initial stages of interaction. \r\n\r\nThe galaxy to the right of the Siamese Twins is NGC 4564, a magnitude 11 elliptical galaxy in the same field of view.\r\n\r\nThese galaxies are in the process of colliding and merging with each other, as studies of their distributions of neutral and molecular hydrogen show, with the highest star formation activity in the part where they overlap. However the system is still in an early phase of interaction\r\n\r\nDate: Mar 23 - Apr 27, 2014, Processing Apr 2, 2020\r\nLocation: New Ringgold PA\r\nOptics: Hyperion f/8 12.5 inch, FL 2540 mm \r\nMount: Paramount ME\r\nCamera: Apogee U8300\r\nGuiding: ST-402 on Innovations Foresight On-Axis Guider, SharpLock focusing method\r\nExposure: LRGB: L:24x10min R:21x8 min, G:11x6 min, B:24x10 min for a total of 11.9 hrs. 80 subs at avg 536 sec\r\nProcessing: Image acquisition using CCD Autopilot.
