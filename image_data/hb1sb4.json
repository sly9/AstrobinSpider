    "description": "Messier 106 (aka NGC 4258) - spiral galaxy in the Canes Venatici\r\n\r\nThis image took several nights to capture successfully. Initial trials with a light pollution filter and 1-3 minute exposures yielded little usable data from my suburban location. Only increasing subs to 5 minutes with a Luminance filter produced enough good subs to  properly process the low surface brightness galactic arms to distinction. The active nucleus more easily reveals its distinct details.",
