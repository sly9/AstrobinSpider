    "description": "This image contains lots of nameless but nevertheless remarkable nebulosities which are part of the great Taurus molecular cloud. To the left the bright Star Atik and bright reflection nebula IC348. In center a very colorful nebula, mixing reflection and emission nebula with dust. The dark structures is in E.E.barnards catalogue of dark nebulae and has the number B3. Apparently in his days the faint emission nebulae were not so prominently recorded by his photogaphic plates, like with a modern Apo equipped with ASI1600MMC camera can do. We live in a great age of astronomy!\r\n\r\nLRGB 25+8+7+7 subframes 8min at gain zero.",
