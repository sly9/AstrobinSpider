    "description": "A thunderstorm was passing through as I went to bed last night, but occasionally this results in nice, clear skies afterwards here and I had a feeling. So I left the 'scope out to equilibrate and set my \"astro alarm\" (vibrate only, so as not to wake my better half) for the wee hours.\r\n\r\nVery much worth it, as the skies were very clear when I woke. Seeing was OK, but not great. Here are the results. I'm struggling for good contrast this season, not quite sure why ... had to push the gamma harder than usual to cut through the \"haze\".\r\n\r\nThe variation in thickness of the STZ are interesting, as are the sheer number of white ovals present in the south and north temperate zones. And there is all kinds of turbulence in the NEB, as there has been for a while now. Lots going on as always, which is why I love Jupiter so much ... such a dynamic atmosphere! \r\n\r\nI also got some data on Saturn and Mars, although conditions had worsened by then ... still working on that data.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
