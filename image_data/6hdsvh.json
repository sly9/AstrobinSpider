    "description": "Even though I've used the commercial Mewlon x0.8 reducer very well so far, the slight residual coma annoyed me a lots. \r\n \r\nSince 2018, as a personal project, I designed 5-element Mewlon reducer, which go down to F/8.0 with Mewlon-210 version. This design is also compatible with Mewlon-180 with different barrel length. Finally, I got the first light with my new reducer this week.",
