    "description": "NGC 1097 can be found in the constellation of Fornax, and is classified as a SBbc, barred spiral galaxy.  It is about 45 million light years away.  It was discovered by William Herschel on the 9th of October 1790.  \r\n\r\nIt’s a fantastic galaxy to look at.  It’s a galaxy that has a lot going on.  Visually, you can see the distortions and tidal debris that have resulted by the interaction with the companion galaxy NGC 1097A.   Personally, the most interesting thing are the optical jets that show up in deep exposures.  \r\n\r\nLike all nice galaxies, it has a supermassive black hole at its centre.  The mass has been calculated to be 140 million times the mass of our sun\r\n\r\nObject Details\r\nNGC 1097, Arp 77     \r\nConstellation: Fornax, Galaxy type: SBbc (barred spiral)\r\nSize: 9.3’ x 6.2’\r\nRecession Velocity: 1,284 km/sec\r\n\r\nImage Details:\r\nCenter (RA, hms):       02h 46m 26.416s\r\nCenter (Dec, dms):     -30° 16' 14.288\"\r\nField of View:\t        34.1 x 26.9 arcmin\r\nRadius:\t                 0.362 deg\r\nPixel scale:\t         0.8 arcsec/pixel\r\nOrientation:\t         Up is 294 degrees E of N\r\n\r\nInstruments:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\n36 X 900 Bin 1X1 Lum\r\n12 X 450 Bin 2X2 Red\r\n12 X 450 Bin 2X2 Green\r\n12 X 450 Bin 2X2 Blue\r\n19 X 1200 Bin 1X1 Ha\r\n\r\nLocation\r\nAustralia, Central Victoria",
