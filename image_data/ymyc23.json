    "description": "<b>М 57 envelope</b>\r\n\r\nM57 halo (\"envelope\") is considered to be outer layers of the host star blown away by stellar wind during asymptotic giant branch phase just before nebula itself was born.\r\n\r\n----\r\nThe nebula image is Ha-OIII-OIII composition (200% crop of central part). Stars were overlaid from RGB image.\r\nDue to high dynamic range, some processing tweaks were used. First, two separate integrations per filter were made: best of the best based on FWHM criteria for the brightest nebula part and a full set of images for maximizing SNR in shadows. Than stretch of various degree was applied. And they all were combined later into artificial HDR.\r\n\r\n----\r\n[1] Nebula 3D model image was taken from <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.6636.pdf#page=29>\"Studies of NGC 6720 with Calibrated HST WFC3 Emission-Line Filter Images–I: Structure and Evolution\", C. R. O’Dell, G. J. Ferland, W. J. Henney and M. Peimbert, 2013</a>\r\n\r\n----\r\nFull frame:\r\n<a href=https://www.astrobin.com/ymyc23/C/><img src=\"https://cdn.astrobin.com/thumbs/uGgFsDnKgBd8_80x80_UUPQI_hZ.png\"></a>",
