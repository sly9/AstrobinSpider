    "description": "This is part of the makarian Galaxy chain. The bright lenticular Galaxy M86 is in the center of this cosmic image, in the heart of the Virgo Cluster. Other bright nearby galaxies include M84 at the top right, NGC 4388 at the right edge, a pair of spectacular and interacting Galaxy eyes of makarin at the lower left corner of the image, and NGC 4402 at 11 o'clock. Because it has more than 1000 members, the Virgo Cluster is the closest large cluster to us. The cluster is about 50 million light-years away on average. The whole Virgo Cluster is hard to appreciate because it covers a large area, about 10 degrees in the sky. The above close-up of the cluster only covers an area below 1 degree, only 1.5 times the full moon.",
