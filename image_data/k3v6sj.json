    "description": "Another HDR project, though only from a single night this time. The halo from this planetary nebula is relatively bright and I was able to reveal some structure even with a short integration.\r\n\r\nMouse-over shows the core details with just the RGB data.\r\n\r\nData was 2X drizzle stacked. Full resolution view is recommended because this object is tiny!",
