    "description": "Recently, the weather is awful. It has been sunny at the beginning until I just set up my equipment and prepare to shoot. It is all over the sky that the cloud is not good at shooting. What can I do was just sitting beside my DOB16, waiting the seeing turn better. Fortunately, I obtain this picture. Now the Jupiter is a bit bigger than ever. SEB and STB have taken place of lots of changes too.",
