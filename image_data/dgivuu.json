    "description": "A physical pair of galaxies in Triangulum about 20 million light years away. It is thought that the galaxies are located on a dark matter filament and are accreting intergalactic cold gas focused by the filament: <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/390/1/408/974955\">The NGC 672 and 784 galaxy groups: evidence for galaxy formation and growth along a nearby dark matter filament</a> I.e. we are probably looking at a pair of \"new-born\" irregular galaxies, which will merge into a larger spiral galaxy in the future.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.\r\nVitali",
