    "description": "The Stephan's quintet has been a favorite target of mine and I have been trying to shoot this at every opportunity. \r\n\r\nIn my rig at Marathon Texas (MaRIO) shared with Dhaval Bhrambhatt, I shot about 40x15 mins L subs. But I didn't get the opportunity of shooting color data . However, I had color data from my backyard here in Austin. The color data isn't very good but luckily it is just enough for this. The L data brings in good bit of details in the extended regions .\r\n\r\nL = 40x15 mins\r\nRGB = 15x5 mins/channel",
