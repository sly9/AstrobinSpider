    "description": "Last night I was outside again, and the forecast was perfect. When I reached my place, it looked fairly good, but the first photo already showed it: super thin clouds, invisible to the eye, where basically everywhere. Since I drove for one hour, I stayed until moonrise and took deep-sky as well as panoramics. Let's hope that it is not all ruined! This panoramic at least looks cool. :)",
