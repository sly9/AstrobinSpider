    "description": "Here we have Virgo A, aka Messier 87...\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase from messier-objects.com, this is an enormous elliptical galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster.  It contains approximately 1 trillion stars and lies approximately 53.5 million LY from us.  It has a visual magnitude of 9.6.  \r\n\r\nM87 has a super-massive black hole positioned within 60 ly of the core of the galaxy that has a mass estimated to be 6.5 billion solar masses.  It is from this super-massive black hole that the relativistic jet comes.  \r\n\r\nAs we all know, it is this black hole that was imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope last year.\r\n\r\nI approached this project with the goal of imaging the jet.  I did a HDR sub-project for the luminance by doing some 10s frames and combining them with some 60s frames.  I was actually hoping for a better outcome.  Despite more work on this problem, I still think my collimation is just off enough.\r\n\r\nI used HDR Multiscale Transformation to attenuate the light from the galaxy a little bit to reveal the jet.  That is shown as the inset image in the upper right corner of the image.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it and any comments and/or criticism are always welcome...\r\n\r\nClear Skies and be well...",
