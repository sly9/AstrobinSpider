    "description": "I finally had the chance to image my favorite galaxy for the first time! I fell in love with the Sombrero Galaxy when I saw it through my first telescope back in 2017. This was a bit of a stinker to image though. \r\nI used two cameras and two telescopes to image it. The first set of data came from my Hyperstar setup with my ASI533mc Pro camera. But I wasn't real pleased with the image because that setup has a pixel scale of 1.44\" which doesn't do too well with small galaxies and the seeing wasn't great that night either. A few weeks later, I setup my 4.5\" refractor with my ASI183mm Pro and a luminance filter. The seeing was better, the pixel scale was 0.77\" and my refractor has always given me sharper images than my SCT/Hyperstar rig, so the data was much crisper. I combined the RGB and Lum data sets with different pixel scales using Pixinsight's Dynamic Alignment process. This was the first time I've ever done anything like this, but it worked out really well! I could have used my LRGB filters with with the ASI183mm instead doing it the way I did, but using the OSC camera with the Hyperstar at f2.3 allowed me to gather the RGB data much faster.\r\n\r\nThere's also a link below the image to my YouTube video about imaging this galaxy if you're interested in watching.\r\n\r\nClear Skies,\r\nDaniel",
