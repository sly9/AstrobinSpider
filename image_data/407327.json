    "description": "Still waiting for lengthy clear skies. Luckily we had a 4-hour clearing last night between 9 PM and 1 AM with FWHM under 2\" on 5-minutes subs. NGC4725 was nicely positioned during that time so I went for it. With only 85 minutes of luminance, the faint tidal streams cannot be resolved. I was happy to get most of the spiral structure. Hope to add more L and RGB data as the weather clears.\r\n\r\n\"While most spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way, have two or more spiral arms, NGC 4725 has only one. NGC 4725 is over 100 thousand light-years across and lies 41 million light-years away in constellation Coma Berenices. The smaller galaxy, NGC4712, is 242 million light-years distant.\"",
