    "description": "The Rosette Nebula, also known as Caldwell 49, is an H II region located near one end of a giant molecular cloud in the Monoceros region of the Milky Way Galaxy.\r\n\r\nThe open cluster NGC2244 (Caldwell 50) is closely associated with the nebulosity, the stars of the cluster having been formed from the nebula's matter.\r\n\r\nThe cluster and nebula lie at a distance of around 5,000 light-years from Earth and measure roughly 130 light-years in diameter. \r\nThe radiation from the young stars excites the atoms in the nebula, causing them to emit radiation themselves producing the emission nebula we see. \r\nThe mass of the nebula is estimated to be around 10,000 solar masses.\r\n\r\nCaptured on 24 December 2020 using the Telescope Live CHI-4 astrograph located at the El Sauce Observatory in the Rio Hurtado Valley, Chile, South America the final result comprises 1hr 20mins of total integration.",
