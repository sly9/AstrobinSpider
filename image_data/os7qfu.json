    "description": "Learned about this comet a couple of days ago and with it being in the West together with Sirius at early evening, gave it a go.  Processing was a bit of a challenge to maintain non trailing comet and stars but in the end it came together - toughest part being getting the \"right\" sigma levels on rejection during the Imageintegration in Pixinsight.\r\n\r\nC/2019 U6 (Lemmon), or Comet Lemmon is a comet with a near-parabolic orbit discovered by the Mount Lemmon Survey on October 31, 2019. It will make its closest approach to the Sun on June 18, 2020. It currently has an apparent magnitude of 7.8, and might be visible near the naked eye limit in June.\r\n\r\nIn the lower right, NGC2216 at 131m LY, is a spiral galaxy.",
