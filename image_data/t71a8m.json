    "description": "Quite a rare target, making this the only the 8th image of it on Astrobin! I can see why though, it is insanely dim and rather small. It isn't the prettiest to look at, but the story behind it is rather interesting. I suggest reading Terry Robinson's post about it along with his nearly SEVENTY HOUR exposure on it https://www.astrobin.com/381414/?nc=user\r\n\r\nOverall, I am very happy with how this turned out. Given the very low brightness of it and where the data started, I didn't think I'd be able to get it this far. Especially with how poor I am at combining NB and RGB images. This one really seemed to come together in the end though! \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
