    "description": "The photo is a cooperation project of Jens Zippel from Bremen and myself.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nLBN 552 and LDN 1228\r\nMolecular cloud complex in the constellation Cepheus\r\n32.5 hours total exposure\r\n(13.6 hours luminance/IR + 18,5h RGB)\r\nThe fine nebulous structures of LBN 552 (the lighter, fuzzy area) and LDN 1228 (the fungus-like structure) in Cepheus are only slightly more than 11 degrees away from Polaris. The images show only part of the molecular clouds of LBN 552 and LDN 1228, which in turn belong to an even larger cloud system that extends far beyond the constellation of Cepheus. The molecular cloud of LBN 552 is considered the weakest in the \"Lynds Bright Nebula\" catalogue and is therefore a real challenge for the ambitious astrophotographer.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIMAGE WITH DESCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\n1\r\nCarbon star IRAS 21064+7749\r\nCarbon stars are late giant stars, similar to red giants or occasionally red dwarfs. From their spectra, the \"sooty\" outer shell of the stars absorbs the blue and yellow light components. For the observer, this leads to its marked red appearance.\r\n\r\n2\r\nVery dense area in LBN 552, at the same time a strong infrared source, which indicates star formation inside.\r\n\r\n3\r\nOpen star formation area with 3 visible young stellar objects embedded in a dense molecular cloud. In addition, 2 prominent Herbig-Haro objects are visible.\r\n\r\n4\r\nYoung stellar object (YSO)\r\nYSO are stars shortly after a protostar has started its nuclear fusion.\r\n\r\n5\r\nExposed star formation area RNO 129\r\nConsisting of the yellow reflection nebula GN 21.00.4 and some young stellar objects.\r\n\r\n6\r\nHerbig-Haro Objects\r\nStars emitting a huge jet, similar to Hubble's Variable Nebula (NGC 2261). They occur when gas emitted by the star meets clouds of dust. They are often observed around a single star, where they are aligned along its axis of rotation. Herbig-Haro objects have a very short life span of at best a few thousand years.",
