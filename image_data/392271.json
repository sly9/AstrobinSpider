    "description": "Here is the Eagle Nebula in Ha + OIII using a One-Shot-Color ZWO ASI294MC Pro. Last summer I really had my iOptron CEM60 / FLT 132 rig really humming along. \r\n\r\nI couldn't help but shoot as many emission nebulae targets as possible with the incredible duo-narrowband filter. To capture an image of M16 from Bortle Class 8 skies once seemed impossible to me. \r\n\r\nI am excited to try the Triad filter in the coming months in a similar setup!",
