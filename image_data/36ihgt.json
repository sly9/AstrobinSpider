    "description": "Beginning the galaxy season, I decided to finish a started project of last year. I couldn't finish it last year because I was too late for that object in march. It disappeared behind a tree short after sunset. After an endless period of bad weather here in Germany, I took my chance and captured additional luminance and color data of the stunning Sb galaxy in lynx on last sunday over nearly the whole night. Hope you like it.\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
