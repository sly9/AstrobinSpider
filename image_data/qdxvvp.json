    "description": "ngc 3718 is a warped galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. It is at a distance of approximately 50 Mly from earth.\r\nAlso in this field of view is ngc 3729, which may be interacting with ngc 3718, causing the warped structure in the latter. This interaction is also the cause of a large number of stars being created in the outer arms of the main galaxy, giving them a blue appearance.\r\n\r\nThere is a multitude of galaxies in this image, among others LEDA 2432563, just to the upper left of ngc 3718. This small galaxy has a redshift of 0.178, which puts it at a distance of 2500 Mly. Some of the smaller ones in the area are at a distance of up to 3 500 Mly.",
