    "description": "This cosmic crustacean is a large diffuse nebula located in the Constellation of Scorpius close to 8000 light years away from earth.\nSpanning about 400 light years across, this nebula is a region where new stars are being born in chaotic clouds of gas and dust.\nIntricate shapes in the nebula are carved by interstellar winds and energetic radiation from the young and newly forming massive stars.\nThis image consists of 11 hours of imaging time across hydrogen, oxygen and sulphur filters, taken through the Skywatcher Esprit 100ED Telescope and ZWO1600GT Camera.\nProcessed in Photoshop and Pixinsight.\nAll imaged from my suburban Melbourne backyard!",
