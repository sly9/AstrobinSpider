    "description": "My second project with the Dual Setup. The little Newtonians have the perfect focal lenght for this object. It was bitterly cold, but the first clear sky in over four weeks and the transperancy was great. The processing wasn't easy this time. I had to stretch it pretty hard, because the legs of the spider are very faint. As usual a mix of RGB (OSC) and HOO from the Dual-filter.",
