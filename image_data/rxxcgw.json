    "description": "Started to learn a little more about how to do Galaxy processing. It is a totally different animal. Control the star size is such a headache. There must be something that I don't know yet - there is no way I could bring out the blueish dust glows and the vivid color of the core. I like the natural-looking result with good details. But I also like to know how to \"pop\" galaxy colors. Next time. \r\n\r\nHuge thanks to my teammates <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/tbcgeorge/\">TBC George</a>, <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/nodustab/\">Chen Wu</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/yzhzhang/\">Yizhou Zhang</a> for helping me complete the data acquisition. The weather at the beginning of 2021 was truly horrible!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/search/?q=TeamNoctuaDSNM&subject=&telescope=&camera=&date_published_min=2011-11-09&date_published_max=2099-05-10\"><I>#TeamNoctuaDSNM</I></a>",
