    "description": "The neighborhood of the Bubble Nebula, NGC 7635, is populated by many DSOs which are interesting on their own. I had planned to create an Ha / [OIII] version with RGB stars, but the RGB showed much more color variation, so I finally decides to mix only a very small amount of Ha and [OIII] signal into the RGB photograph.",
