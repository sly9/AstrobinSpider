    "description": "The core of the Milky way galaxy, with its bright fields of stars, and wispy tendrils of dark nebulae, rarely fails to impress and mesmerize me.  This view of the region surrounding the Lagoon nebula, M8, and the Trifid nebula, M20, is particularly spectacular. At upper left, two globular clusters appear just above the galactic plane, impressive M22, and its smaller sibling, M28.  It is interesting to speculate on the view one might have if the dust between Earth and the galactic center were removed. Perhaps one day, are descendant's will know ....\r\n\r\nThis wide field image spans 13.8° x 9.7° of northwestern Sagittarius, and is oriented with north to upper right. It was acquired using a Samyang 85mm UMC lens at f4 and Canon 1100D camera operating at ISO 800.",
