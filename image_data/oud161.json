    "description": "NGC 3628, also known as the Hamburger Galaxy, is an unbarred spiral galaxy about 35 million light-years away in the constellation Leo. It has an approximately 300,000 light-years long tidal tail. Along with M65 and M66, NGC 3628 forms the Leo Triplet, a small group of galaxies. Its most conspicuous feature is the broad and obscuring band of dust located along the outer edge of its spiral arms, effectively transecting the galaxy to the view from Earth. (Source Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nI tried to figure out why this is referenced as Sarah's galaxy along with the more famous Hamburger naming. It seems to have a mysterious origin, where some people link the naming to a poet in the 1800's, called Sarah Williams. She wrote the poem titled \"The Old Astronomer\", quoting a small part of it:\r\n\r\n\"Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light;\r\nI have loved the stars too truly to be fearful of the night.\"\r\n\r\nIn any case, Sarah is a name that's very special to me, and I hope I've given this target justice. I know I will keep revisiting it in the coming years",
