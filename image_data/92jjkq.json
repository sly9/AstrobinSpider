    "description": "<I>... Back to how it all started ...</I>\r\n\r\nIt was a nice trip to West Texas over the new moon weekend. I brought along the ultra-widefield setup that has never been put into action. I Keep dreaming about maybe one day I can put all these into a backpack and go to the Southern part of the globe.\r\n<I>\r\n- AZ-GTi (controlled by SGP, a portable GOTO!)\r\n- Sigma ART 50mm/f1.4\r\n- AstroMechanics EF Focus Control Module (54mm)\r\n- QHY168c\r\n</I>\r\nPretty sure I made the mistake setting the <B>gain</B> way too low. Too few chances to visit the dark-site and have no idea what's the proper settings for the OSC. The plan was to shoot a 2-panel mosaic covering the Rho Ophiuchi. But failed to bring out the colors (definitely will try again!).\r\n\r\nNot much processing done. Only Photoshop was used (except for the non-linear conversion - it was done in PixInsight). No flats, no darks, no biases were used to calibrate the raw frames.",
