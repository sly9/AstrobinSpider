    "description": "The most time I've spent on a single target as I've never been happy of the data I've shot here.   I spent the last half of this year going back and forth from other projects to NGC 1333.  Stuck with it and thankfully finished.  \r\n\r\nBeautiful area but too time consuming to shoot as a mosaic as it takes tons of time to mitigate that SNR. :/",
