    "description": "NGC 1300 in Eridanus is a barred spiral galaxy located about 65,000,000 light-years away. The galaxy is about 110,000 light-years across and is thought to contain a supermassive black hole at its center. NGC 1300 was discovered by John Herschel in 1835. Many thanks go out to my collaborator and friend, Mike Selby, who acquired and calibrated this fine data.",
