    "description": "This is data that Rodd Dryfoos kindly put up on SGL for anyone to process, and I just had a go at it. It is narrowband data from Astrodon 3nm filters. 66 x 5min of Ha, 33 x 5 min of Sii and 23 x 5 min of Oiii. Taken with a Takahashi TOA 130 NFB @ f/7.7 and an ASI 1600mm cool on an Astrophysics Mach 1GTO.\r\nTo make it as RGB like as possible, I put both the Ha and Sii in the red channel (50:50 mix). 16% Ha also whent into the green channel (with 84% Sii) and all the Oiii is in the blue channel (Ola Skarpen's mix).  All processing in PS CS5.\r\nThanks Rodd!\r\n\r\nIn version C, I tried my idea of using a Hubble palette (Ha to green, Sii to red and Oiii to blue) as a lum layer in PS (after making it monochrome) in an effort to add more detail to my RGB like palette. In addition I attacked the Hubble palette image with some deconvolution and HDRM in PI to get more details out.\r\n\r\nIn version D, some blue colour has been brought back to the stars that lost it in processing\r\n\r\nIn version E, I used HiPass filtering and curves to bring more details out. It initially became a bit too \"much in your face\" so I softened it a bit by blending in about 25% of one of my older and softer versions",
