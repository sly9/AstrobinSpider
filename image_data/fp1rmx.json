    "description": "Here’s my take on NGC 6188 or better known as “The Fighting Dragons of Ara”. \r\nThis was my first dive into the world of SHO imaging.\r\n\r\nSome details about the image:\r\nI used a few different focus lengths to capture this image. Most of the data was captured using a wide field scopes (530mm & 680mm), while the center region was taken at 2249mm to enhance the resolution of this area. The stacked wide field and longer focal length images were blended in photoshop and then processed.\r\n\r\nCenter Region: \r\nHA 6x10min\r\nOIII 5x10min\r\n\r\nWide Field:\r\nHA 22x10min\r\nOIII 27x10min\r\nSII 13x10min\r\n\r\nTotal integration: 12hrs\r\n\r\nTelescopes, Cameras and Filters:\r\nT8 (Takahashi FSQ106 EDX) & T9 (Tele Vue NP127FLI Refractor)\r\nCamera = FLI Microline 16803\r\n\r\nT31 (Planewave 20\" (0.51m) CDK)\r\nCamera = FLI-PL09000 \r\n\r\nFilters = AstroDon Series 2\r\nHA, OIII, SII\r\n\r\nSoftware: AstroPixel Processor,  Photoshop",
