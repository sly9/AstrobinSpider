    "description": "This is a two panel mosaic of IC 1318 - a diffuse emission nebula in the region of Sadr (γ Cygni).  Sadr is the star at the center of the cross-shaped asterism in the constellation of Cygnus.  It is the brightest star in this image: to the left and slightly above centre.\r\n\r\nBelow and slightly to the right of Sadr is the open cluster NGC 6910.\r\n\r\nSadr is around 1.800 light years distant.  Estimates for the distance to IC 1318 and NGC 6910 vary between 2,000 and 4,000 light years.\r\n\r\nIC 1318 was photographed between 27 May and 28 June 2019 from an imaging rig in Spain that is privately-owned and remotely-operated by Barry Wilson and me.\r\n\r\nCapture details: \r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nCamera: QSI 683 WSG\r\nFilters: Astrodon 5nm NB\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nSII: 42 x 1200s\r\nHa: 52 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 42 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 45 hours and 20 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
