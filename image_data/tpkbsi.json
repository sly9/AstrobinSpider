    "description": "Another image issued from our installation and tests phase, we present a galaxy from January 2020\r\n\r\nNGC- 1566 : The Spanish Dancer Spiral Galaxy\r\nNGC 1566 is the brightest member of a nearby group of galaxies in Dorado and is at a distance of about 50 million light years. Apart from its beautifully symmetrical, tightly-wound spiral arms that are traced by bright blue star clusters and dark cosmic dust lanes, the galaxy is of interest because it has a very luminous nucleus which has many of the characteristics of a quasar, though it is much less energetic. Galaxies of this type are known as Seyfert and itâ€™s one of the brightests member.",
