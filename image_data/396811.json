The IR-mod on the T3i was good for bringing out the natural browns/reds. \r\n\r\nAfter shooting each panel, I converted each RAW panel to a Tiff in Adobe Bridge, stabilized it through PIPP, and stacked them with 3x Drizzle in Autostakkert!3\r\n\r\nPixInsight for Deconvolution and Noise Reduction followed by a Saturation increase in CS6",
