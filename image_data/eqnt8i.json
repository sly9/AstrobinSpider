    "description": "The Fighting Dragons of Ara (NGC 6188) or Rim Nebula \r\nThis concludes my very first multi-session multi-exposure multi-site project on a specific target. 5 nights of imaging, 3 from my backyard (Bortle 5 423 x 300s), and 2 from a dark site (Bortle 1 45 x 1200s) totaling 50.25 hours integration time.\r\nShot through the mighty lil Skywatcher Evostar ED80 on a SkyWatcher HEQ5 Pro mount using a ZWO ASI071MC Pro OSC cooled to only @-5C and an Optolong L-Enhance DuoBand filter. Stacked and processed using PixInsight and Photoshop CC\r\nI am really pleased at how the lil ED80 and HEQ5 Pro have performed on this project and for the last 7 months on my astrophotography journey. I have since upgraded to an NEQ6 Pro with a Rowan Astronomy belt mod. A scope upgrade could be in the works too in the near future",
