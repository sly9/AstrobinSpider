    "description": "M45 Pleiades Open Cluster\r\nControversially, this target is known as the most beautiful deep-sky object in the northern sky. Light from bright young stars (most of B-types) are scattered off the interstellar dusts left over of star-formations. Forwardly scattered photons are towards our field of view, by which this has beautiful blue. This cluster type is called \"Reflection Nebula\". Naked eyes and binoculars are good options for enjoying M45.",
