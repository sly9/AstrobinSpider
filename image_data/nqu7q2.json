    "description": "This is a 300° panorama of the Northern Lights over Yellowknife, NWT on the night of Sept 6-7, 2019, during a sub-storm outbreak at 12:45 a.m. when the sky went wild with aurora. There were curtains and rays everywhere. The display soon subsided into a general wash over the sky. \r\n\r\nThis is from Pilot’s Monument lookout in Old Town. South is left of centre; East is at far left; West is right of centre, and North is at far right, with the Big Dipper visible. Taurus and the Pleiades are rising at far left. \r\n\r\nThis is a 9-segment panorama with the 15mm Laowa lens at f/2 and Sony a7III at ISO 800, for 10 seconds each. LENR employed in camera. Stitched with ACR.",
