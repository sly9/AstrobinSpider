    "description": "This is an image that I imaged on 8-3-17  and completely reprocessed today 8-10-17.   Instead of\r\ndoing a revision on my original image I decided to post another image and leave my original\r\nimage as is because I'm satisfied with it.   The image I reprocessed today has a little different\r\nlook to it as far as the nebulosity detail and color.   I cropped the image so M57 would not\r\nlook so lost in the large field of view.   Anyway with all of that said I just thought I would\r\nshare an image that I reprocessed.    ",
