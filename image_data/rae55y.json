    "description": "This is one of my favorite objects. I tried to get the tidal tail near Hamburger Galaxy by exposure longer. The result was not good from my sky. The background is brighter than I usually set when I try to pull out the details of the tidal tail. Maybe I should add more frames. \r\nC & C are welcome.\r\nCS\r\nJian Yuan Peng\r\n-- facts --\r\nThe Leo Triplet (aka M66 Group) is a small group of galaxies consisting of the spiral galaxies M65, M66, and NGC 3628 about 35 ~ 36 million light-years away in the constellation Leo.\r\nThese three large spiral galaxies can be seen well in a single field of view in small telescopes. Their galactic disks are tilted at different angles when seen from Earth. NGC 3628 appears edge-on, while M65 and M66 are inclined enough to reveal their spiral arms. The three galaxies are gravitationally bound to each other.\r\nNGC 3628(lower right), also known as the Hamburger Galaxy or Sarah’s Galaxy, is a famous unbarred spiral galaxy and has an apparent magnitude of 10.2. The Hamburger Galaxy is known for its broad equatorial band of dust and a vast tidal tail, spanning approximately 300,000 light-years. It is classified as a “starburst galaxy”.\r\n\r\nMessier 65 (M65)(lower left) is an intermediate spiral galaxy with a linear diameter of about 90,000 light-years and has an apparent magnitude of 10.25. Its high surface brightness is visible even in small binoculars and appears as an oval-shaped patch.\r\nMessier 66 (M66, NGC3627) (upper left) is an intermediate spiral galaxy, the brightest and largest member of the Leo Triplet of galaxies with a spatial diameter of about 95,000 light-years, and has an apparent magnitude of 8.9. M66 is separated from M65 by only 200,000 light-years or 20 arc minutes of apparent sky.\r\nTechnical details:\r\nlocation: Palo Alto, California, USA\r\nPhotometricColorCalibration data:\r\nResolution ............... 0.784 arcsec/px\r\nRotation ................. 145.832 deg\r\nObservation start time ... 2021-02-05 08:40:58 UTC\r\nObservation end time ..... 2021-03-21 09:38:44 UTC\r\nGeodetic coordinates ..... 122 08 00 W  37 26 00 N\r\nFocal distance ........... 989.34 mm\r\nPixel size ............... 3.76 um\r\nField of view ............ 1d 42' 11.8\" x 1d 13' 27.2\"\r\nImage center .............
