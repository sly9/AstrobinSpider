    "description": "This is NGC891 shot from September 8th, 2016 through October 31st, 2016.  In total 171 exposures, mostly 10 minute but a few 15 minute subs mixed in as well.  This is another difficult target for a DSLR but again with enough exposures the details can be extracted.  What amazes me also is just how many background galaxies there are as well!  Wonderful target and fun to process.",
