    "description": "The Lobster Claw hangs in space between the constellations of Cassiopeia and Cepheus. \r\n\r\nThis emission nebula glows dimly as the hydrogen and oxygen gasses are ionized by the nearby stars.   These stars gravitationally coalesce from these gasses. Once they ignite nuclear fusion, the radiation pushes the clouds back into the convoluted shapes we see through our telescopes.\r\n\r\nOn a technical side note, this was another image done in narrowband on the AR152 telescope. I find this scope to be a remarkable performer, considering its being used in a photographic capacity which it was never intended for.",
