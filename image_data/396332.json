    "description": "I decided to start from scratch,   adding a few more hours to Gabriela Mistral,  I'm still learning the secrets of good editing, but I know I collected some decent data this time around, everything collaborated last night : a clear sky without wind, good guiding- for my standards- at around 0.7 - 0.9 rms,  I also discovered that my filters are not parfocal as I thought, (which means all my previous work is out of focus.. ;)\r\nOh well.   There's a lot to learn.\r\n\r\nUntil then, clear skies everyone!",
