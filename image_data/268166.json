    "description": "NGC 7023 Iris Nebula\r\n\r\nNGC 7023 is a reflection nebula, known by name as Iris Nebula. These clouds of interstellar dust and gas are located at a distance of 1,300 years light from us, located in the constellation of Cepheus. Inside the nebula, the nebular dusty material surrounds a hot young star named ODS 19158.\r\n\r\nSAO 19158 is the cause of the light reflected in the dust particles that surround it, making the predominant color is blue, characteristic of dust grains reflecting starlight. Central filaments of the dusty clouds glow with a faint reddish photoluminescence as some dust grains convert invisible ultraviolet radiation from stars in visible red light. Infrared observations indicate that this nebula may contain complex carbon molecules known as PAHs.\r\n\r\nLocation: Ã€ger-Lleida-Spain.\r\nDates: 27-29-30 and 2-4-5 Sep.
