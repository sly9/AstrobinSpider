    "description": "This Mars image features Solis Lacus, and is probably my best attempt to-date and will probably be the best I can get in this apparition.  It was a good combination off seeing, decently close to opposition yet late enough that the silly dust storm had settled enough to pull out surface detail.\r\n\r\nThis is an IRRGB composition which usually results in some squirrely colors including killing the brightness of the southern cap and northern hood.  I used WinJupos to combine the RGB together, but used PixInsight to selectively apply the IR as luminance across the surface with a well-placed feathered mask, thereby letting the cap and hood stand alone from RGB.  I think it worked fairly well to maximize detail across the surface, and hopefully others think the color is accurate.",
