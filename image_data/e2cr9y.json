    "description": "This has been my main widefield target for this winter and it took couple of nights to do right. I finally solved my problems with flats on 6D as the camera histogram shows the saturation higher than it actually is. At f2 the flats have to be precise and it took me a long time to realize that I was doing flats too \"weak\". After doing some analysis in Pixinsight I finally found out what the problem was, got new set of flats and got 6 hours of data on Orion. \r\n\r\nAnother struggle was to persuade my tiny Star Adventurer Mini to hold my camera  sideways so I could fit all the stuff I wanted into one shot. Mounting my camera sideways made it really wobbly and I was amazed how little of garbage I had to throw out.\r\n\r\nAnyway, one of my goals is finally done.",
