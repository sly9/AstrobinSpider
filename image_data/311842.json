    "description": "I've been reimaging some targets that I did a few years ago as both my technique at the telescope and post-processing have advanced.  I did this target a few years back and blended in Ha into the L channel for higher nebula contrast.  This time, it is a straight LRGB that was acquired with good seeing and a very dark site.  The objective was to try and bring out some of the dark dust surrounding the nebula which was done by creating a moderately stretched image and a highly stretched image and then layered them together.  I kind of like the smoother look of the nebula without Ha added to the L channel.  I've also started using DSS for stacking as it does a better job aligning star colors than Nebulosity.  It took awhile to get all the settings right though.   L 20x400s, RGB 10x200s 2x2 binned.",
