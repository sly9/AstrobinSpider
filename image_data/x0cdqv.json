    "description": "The fishead nebula, belonging to the heart nebula complex is a target, I was long waiting for to aim on and thinking about how to process. Here in astrobin there are a lot of beautiful versions, so it was not so easy for me which way to go. Finally I decided for this more yellowish you can see here. What a stunning target, I thought by myself while processing.....hope you like it.....",
