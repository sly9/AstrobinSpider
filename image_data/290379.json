    "description": "The bright red emission nebulae in the southern constellation of Centaurus, cataloged as IC 2948/2944, are near the star Lambda Centauri and not far on the sky from the better known Eta Carinae Nebula. Embedded in the reddish glowing cloud of hydrogen gas, is the energetic young star cluster Collinder 249. Seen in silhouette at the very center of the view are small, dark clouds of obscuring cosmic dust. Called Thackeray's Globules for their discoverer, they are potential sites for the formation of new stars, but are likely being eroded by the intense radiation from the nearby young stars. The gorgeous skyscape spans about 70 light-years at the nebula's estimated 6,000 light-year distance. (ref. http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080418.html )",
