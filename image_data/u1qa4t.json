    "description": "From right to left in the final, cropped image are shown the small spiral galaxy NGC3165, the barred spiral galaxy NGC3166 (notice the small barred spiral arm in its bright centre) and the unbarred spiral galaxy NGC3169. These three galaxies form a small group within the larger Leo 1 group. The galaxies are about 75 million light years away in the constellation Sextans. \r\nThe  two larger galaxies are clearly interacting, with NGC3169 showing a.o. an asymmetric spiral arm and NGC3166 a warped disk. Also notice the weak stellar streams north and south of these two interacting galaxies. \r\nIn the uncropped image also the lenticular galaxy NGC3156 is shown.",
