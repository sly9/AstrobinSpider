    "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is an unusual (experimental?) attempt on NGC 6357 using only Ha and SII data.\r\n\r\nMy first subs with OIII filter were very disappointing even binned 2X. Signal was very weak, even on the bright center of the Nebula. (Suburban area? filter performance?)\r\n\r\nSII was rather interesting, so I decided to put all my efforts on these only 2 bands: Ha and SII.\r\nMore than 25 hours of integration.\r\n\r\nInstead of SHO, I tried many band combinations, finally I found that something like S(S*H)H may have potential to highlight contrast between bands.\r\nMaybe I did wrong... let me know what you thing of the monster lobster :-)\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and watching",
