    "description": "First Uranus attempt. I knew it was going to be hard but when I tried it last night it is another ball game compared to Jupiter/Saturn . Getting the planet on the camera chip as well as getting it focused was quite challenging! I missed shooting Neptune (which seems to have a bright storm spot visible) last night. Anyways, Here is a composite of the Planet with its bright moons. One of the closer moon (Miranda) is actually visible in my stacks but is lost in the planet glow .\r\nThere isn't much in terms of details here.. Just the greenish ball. Apparently if the seeing is good, it is possible to see polar region but I cant see any thing here ;)\r\nShot with Celestron Edge11/AP900/ASI224MC/Televue 2.5x Powermate. Stacked 20 minutes of video with best 50% and fiddled around with Pixinsight/Registax.\r\n\r\nGain 320, Exposure 120ms for Planet (Took 3x20 min video but did not do any derotation)\r\nGain 450, Exposure 2 sec for Moons (200 frames)\r\n\r\nColors straight from AS3!",
