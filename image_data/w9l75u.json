    "description": "During our treatments in progress, we still present an image made during the tests and settings for the set-up and so not totally completed but that we like and would like to share with you:\r\n \r\nNGC 4945\r\nIC 2177 (or SH2-296 or Gum1) is a region of nebulosity that lies along the border between the constellations Monoceros and Canis Major. It is a roughly circular H II region centered on the Be star HD 53367. It is located 3,800 light-years away from Earth, inside the Orion spur -- the same partial spiral arm of the Milky Way where our solar system is located. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Seagull Nebula is sometimes applied by amateur astronomers to this emission region, although it more properly includes the neighboring regions of star clusters, dust clouds and reflection nebulae. This latter region includes the open clusters NGC 2335 and NGC 2343 and the reflection nebula NGC 2327\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tFaceBook : https://www.facebook.com/Los-Calvos-Observatory-383526525524141\r\n•\tInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/loscalvos.elsauce/\r\n•\tWebsite :https://loscalvos-astrophotography.com/",
