    "description": "This day I had extremely good seeing. Unfortunately it was almost Full Monn (82%) so it was really challenging to collect nice LRGB data.\r\n\r\nBut I tried and anyway I'm really happy of the result.\r\n\r\nAdding Ha 35band allowed to reweal some nice detail of starbursts which are surrounding galaxy\r\n\r\nNative scale is 0,35''/pix :)\r\n\r\nNewton 350/1400 on EQ6 + ASI 178MM-C\r\nL: 1200 x 4s (gain 82%)\r\nHa 35nm:  300 x 22s (gain 86%)\r\nRGB: 500 x 5s (gain 82%) per channel\r\nBaader MPCC Mark III coma corrector",
