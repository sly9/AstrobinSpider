    "description": "Sh2-236 is a reflection nebula located in the constellation Cepheus. It lies near the cluster NGC 7023. The Ghost nebula (also VdB 141) is over 2 light-years across. The reddish object at left is Bok Globule CB230. There are several stars embedded, whose emissions make the nebula shine in brownish color. This image is a collaboration between myself (post-processing), Paul Gardner (preprocessing), and David Siminoff (Siminoff Observatory).",
