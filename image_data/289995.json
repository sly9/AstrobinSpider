    "description": "I wanted to test my Telescope after replacing the secondary mirror for a bigger one, i calculated that my old secondary's 100% illumination was about 7 mm and my sensor is about 18 wide, so by replacing the secondary the 100 % illumination now covers all the sensor, this is the result....\r\nM8\r\nha 10 x 300\r\noiii 10 x 300\r\nsii 10 x 300\r\nSome how i have less vignette or nasty gradients from the filters, this photo has no Flats on it.\r\nThis is a real difference in comparison with the way it was behaving before, now it is a new telescope.....",
