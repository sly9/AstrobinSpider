    "description": "Originally conceived by Steve and I as a target to bridge the altitude gap between two other projects, gathering data while we wait for the next project to rise, I am pleased to see the detail that the TEC can pull out of our neighbouring galaxy.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia: \"NGC 206 is the richest and most conspicuous star cloud in the Andromeda Galaxy as well as one of the largest and brightest star formation regions of the Local Group.[2] It contains more than 300 stars brighter than Mb=âˆ’3.6.[3] It was originally identified by Edwin Hubble as a star cluster but today, due to its size, it is classified as an OB association.[4]\r\n\r\nNGC 206 is located in a spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy, in a zone free of neutral hydrogen and has a double structure, with one region that has an age of around 10 million years and includes several H II regions in one of its borders and other with an age of between 40 million years and 50 million years that includes a number of cepheids. Both parts are separated by a band of interstellar dust and include hundreds of stars of spectral type O and B\".\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson.",
