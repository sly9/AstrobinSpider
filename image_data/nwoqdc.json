    "description": "This a hybrid TEC140/ODK14 image jointly captured with Yves Van den Broek. Approx. 30 hours in HaLRGB, all from Les Granges in SE France.\r\n\r\nLike most people I usually end up presenting a galaxy with reddish core and blue spiral arms but it was pointed out on a thread on SGL that the Hubble image does not confirm this. With the HST result in mind I tried again and came up with this rendition.",
