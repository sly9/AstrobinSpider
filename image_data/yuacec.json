    "description": "M74 - Phantom Galaxy (NGC 628), a very feint galaxy, yet one of the most beautiful ones.\r\nYou would think you have seen it, but then it's not there. Then, you see it again, only for it to disappear again to the observer.\r\nIt is truly a phantom galaxy, a ghost, a figment of the imagination, not real; illusory. Very hard to see, capture and to process.\r\nI intended to capture it earlier when I started my astrophotography hobby and I finally did so. Took a long time to image it, but it was worth every second.",
