    "description": "Sh2-174 ranks as the most northern Sharpless objects at 81 degrees north. Sh2-174 very close to Polaris is most likely part of the galactic dust cloud above is just to the north of Sh2-174\r\nSh2-174 is very weak, but very large.\r\nEven with extreme  lot of exposure, this became too weak for our equipment. Unfortunately, it was too much noise and too little signalsðŸ˜•",
