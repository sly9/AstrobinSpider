    "description": "Seeing was pretty good as I started observing this galaxy, which is why I used bin 1 on my camera, but seeing degraded and prevented me from capturing enough frames in the live-stack to cut the noise. This galaxy is so rich in blue clusters, presumably O-B associations and reflection nebula. Definitely worth another look to gather more data to reduce the noise. Interesting that this galaxy has so many young clusters, but very little red hydrogen powered emission nebula in it.",
