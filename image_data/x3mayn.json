    "description": "M106 has been one of my earliest targets (and no wonder as it is one of the brightest galaxies in the near Universe) and a constant fascination for the morphology of this Seyfert galaxy. The genesis of this image harks back to the spring of 2005 as a set of unguided short integrations. The results were, yet again, not much appealing given the very low SNR in the faint outer arms. Shelved for the moment been I picked it up briefly in 2007 to test guiding but other objects beckoned for my attention. Finally in 2008 decided to draw the ongoing saga to an end and went for 5min subs all the way and this is the results. Again, with hindsight I should probably added a set of H-alpha integrations to the pot but I'm equally happy with the present result. As they say: YMMV.",
