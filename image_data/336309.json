    "description": "Here is a little daytime astrophotography for a change.   I was able to get together with a friend who is well equipped for solar imaging on a seemingly rare, cloudless afternoon.   We captured this timelapse of 1 hour and 6 minutes of movement on a monster prominence.    \r\n\r\nThe first revision shows forward motion with a 2x speed reverse for smooth playback.   Revision E is the same as the first, but with an Earth scale reference added in the corner.    Rev C shows only the forward motion.  \r\n\r\nThe sequence was captured on March 3, 2018, through a pressure-tuned Lunt 60THa and ASI290MM with a 2.5x Power-mate.    The firecapture autorun feature was used to grab all the frames.     The best 250/1000 frames of each video was stacked in Autostakkert!3 and then processed through PixInsight, back to AS!3 for frame alignment, then Photoshop for cleanup, the Premiere Pro for stabilization, then Photoshop for final touches.  \r\n\r\nEquipment and Image capture: <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/avzaid/\">Awni Hafedh</a> and Jason Guenzel\r\nProcessing:  Jason Guenzel",
