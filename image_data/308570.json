    "description": "I like the overall color and corona capture, especially the pinkish prominences. Focus slightly off (my nemisis...)  I found it extremely difficult the morning of the Eclipse to get focus. I took many practice photos of the sun, but the glare of bright sun made it really difficult to see the laptop screen.  Lesson learned, for solar eclipses you need to cover your head and laptop with a big blanket or something so you can see the laptop screen to get a strong focus result. Not possible with my tools to do any fhwm using the sun.",
