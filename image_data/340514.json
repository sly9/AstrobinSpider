    "description": "Hi all.\r\nThis is a beautiful galaxy often overlooked, but with a lot of details.\r\nThe framing is quite odd, but I was forced to that because the suitable guide star was on the east side of the galaxy. In this picture, north is on the left.\r\nThe signal was poor too, as I shooted at it only few days past full moon.\r\nThe colours are from an old session on this object in 2009.\r\nAnyway, hope you like it.\r\nCiao!",
