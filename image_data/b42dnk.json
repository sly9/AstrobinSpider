    "description": "Several years ago I captured this beautiful region of Sky and called it “The Cosmic Continent”\r\nHere is my latest Hubble Palette (SHO) version, a very wide view of The North America Nebula otherwise known as NGC7000 using data from Grand Mesa Observatory’s System 1a the William Optics Redcat together with a QHY16200A Monochrome CCD, this combination is giving a field of view of approximately 6 x 5 degrees\r\n\r\nThe William Optics Redcat with QHY16200A and its 7 position filter wheel is now available at Grand Mesa Observatory for subscription, see here for details.\r\nhttps://grandmesaobservatory.com/equipment\r\n\r\nIn this Hubble Palette version the H-Alpha is mapped to green, SII is mapped to red and OIII is mapped to the blue channel. I removed the stars using Starnet and replaced them with the naturally colored stars from the broadband image, while the colors in this image are not the true colors, the narrowband filters used in the making of this Hubble Palette image reveal much more of the hidden gasses not visible in a broadband image.\r\n\r\nCaptured over 7 nights in May and June 2020 for a total acquisition time of 15 hours. \r\n\r\nThe North America Nebula (NGC 7000 or Caldwell 20) is an emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus that resembles the shape of North America and The Gulf Of Mexico. It lies at a distance of approximately 1800 light years away from us.\r\n\r\nThis image contains some very interesting areas such as The Cygnus Wall which is representative of Mexico and Central America, the nearby emission objects Pelican Nebula (IC5070) and the faint emission nebula IC5068 \r\n\r\nTechnical Details\r\nCaptured and processed by: Terry Hancock\r\nLocation: GrandMesaObservatory.com Purdy Mesa, Colorado\r\nMay 5th, 20th, 21st, 25th, 29th, 31st, June 8th\r\n\r\nHA 240 min 24 x 900 sec\r\nOIII 255 min 25 x 900 sec\r\nSII 225 min 23 x 900 sec\r\nLRGB 180 min 9 x 300 sec\r\n\r\nFilters by Chroma\r\nCamera: QHY16200A\r\nGain 0, Offset 130 Calibrated with Flat, Dark and Bias Frames.\r\nOptics: William Optics Redcat 51 APO @ F4.9\r\nEQ Mount: Paramount MEII\r\nImage Acquisition software Maxim DL6\r\nPre Processing in Pixinsight\r\nPost Processed in Photoshop CC\r\nStar Removal by Starnet",
