    "description": "M78 is a complex of reflection nebulae, dark clouds hiding stellar nurseries and patches of emission, including Herbig-Haros and one of the prominent variable nebulas, McNeil's. So much variable indeed, that was not visible at all at the time of these exposures. The M78 complex is one of the brightest reflection nebulas, easily seen in a small telescope. Amazing to see how much detail appear with fair resolution.",
