(thanks Diego)\r\nReprocessed in APP using drizzle and a couple of other tweaks including Dynamic Distortion Correction - much more detail showing now and nice star spectrums in the diffraction spikes!\r\nAmazed how much extra detail there was in the S2 layer star removal using Starnet++\r\n\r\nTime to put this one to bed & move on - thanks for looking!\r\n\r\nPhotographed from my LP affected suburban backyard in Melbourne - Australia.",
