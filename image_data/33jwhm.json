NGC 6872 is interacting with the lenticular galaxy IC 4970, which is less than one twelfth as large. The galaxy has two elongated arms; from tip to tip, NGC 6872 measures 522,000 light-years (160,000 pc), making it one of the largest known spiral galaxies.\r\n\r\nNGC 6872 is a member of a small cluster of galaxies centred on the giant elleptical galaxy, NGC 6876, which is the brightest galaxy in the image (top right).\r\n\r\nRA: 20h 19m 02.16s\r\nDEC: -70° 42' 14.5\"\r\nLocation: Pavo\r\nDistance: 210 Mly\r\nMagnitude: 11.6\r\n\r\nAcquisition September 2020\r\nTotal acquisition time of 25 hours.\r\n\r\nPlanewave CDK17\r\nTechnical Details\r\nData acquisition: Martin PUGH\r\nProcessing: Nicolas ROLLAND\r\nLocation: El Sauce Observatory, Rio Hurtado, Chile\r\nL 21 x 1200 sec\r\nR 15 x 1200 sec\r\nG 15 x 1200 sec\r\nB 15 x 1200 sec\r\nHa 6 x 1800 sec\r\nOptics: Planewave 17“ CDK @ F6.8\r\nMount: Paramount ME\r\nCCD: SBIG STXL-11002 (AOX)\r\nPre Processing: CCDstack & Pixinsight\r\nPost Processing: Photoshop CC",
