    "description": "NGC 3628, also known informally as the \"Hamburger Galaxy\", is in the constellation of Leo. It is classified as an un-barred spiral galaxy and we see it almost exactly edge on. Most obvious is its large band of dust bisecting the layers of the \"hamburger\". It also has a thin tidal tail of dust almost 300,000 light years long, seen very faintly off to the upper left here. NGC3628 lies at a distance of 35 million light years.",
