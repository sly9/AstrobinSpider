    "description": "NGC7000 has eluded me for some time.  I have tried to get the North America Nebula first with my DSLR, then I ran out of time in the year last year and could only get Ha.  This year while collecting data for the Western Veil shot I got I collected data on this target as well but that didn't come out either.  Finally, I tried my luck with the Rokinon 135mm lens and was able to get this shot.  \r\n\r\nOriginally I was trying to bring out the blue from oxygen but I was collecting 5-minute subs so I think the oxygen was over-exposed, but as a result of that, it really reduced the deep red from the hydrogen when I combined them.  I also was able to bring out the nebulosity around the nebula which gave it a really nice look.  This is definitely so far my favorite of the super wide-field shots I've taken and I'm really REALLY loving this Rokinon lens.\r\n\r\n***** EDIT *****\r\nI discovered that my Oxygen and Sulfur were switched in SGP for my Rokinon profile.  This image is in HSS not HOO.",
