    "description": "I had hoped to have this one completed a couple of weeks ago but uncooperative September weather put a kibosh on that hope (there are actually several 1 or 2-sub nights in that long acquisition date list above!). All in all, the data was pretty decent, save for a handful of cloud contaminated OIII subs.\r\n\r\nThis fov is clearly not 100% ideal for this target - too cramped for composition options, too big for mosaic - but it does get in close enough to appreciate the striking structure and filaments in this interesting area.",
