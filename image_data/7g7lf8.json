    "description": "Here is an unusual view of the Vela supernova remnant. The seven degree field of view of the Very Small Telescope was just large enough to encompass most of the SNRâ€™s interesting features. This image was captured in the Ha, SII and OIII channels, which yielded an intricate and colorful image. The Vela SNR is one of the closest supernova remnants to Earth.\r\n\r\nThe full resolution version of this image shows some wonderful detail.\r\n\r\nTech Notes for Very Small Telescope\r\nNikon 200mm lens, f/2\r\n10 Micron GM1000HPs Robotic Mount\r\nFLI Microline 16200 CCD Camera, 6mm pixel\r\nProcessing with PixInsight and Affinity Photo",
