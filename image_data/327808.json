    "description": "This is the last image for the year with 100 images stacked for the light-side and 100 images stacked for the dark-side.  The earth-shine was impossible to capture due to how bright the moon was so.... it's not real so I used the last full moon I captured, to become the dark-side and it work very well. It all came together way to easily. With that said the rest of the image is all real. The colours were what I captured but just over saturated. This all came together to make this image work, if any nerds out there know how to capture the dark side this late in the moon-phase I would love to know.",
