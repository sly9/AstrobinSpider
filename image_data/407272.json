    "description": "Here we have the latest in my series of globular clusters...  I'm doing this for several reasons; 1) I really like globular clusters and 2), I am using a different imaging technique on each one to tryo to make some comparisons in imaging similar objects.\r\n\r\nI think this image may be one of my best from a technical perspective and I am somewhat encouraged by my processing on it too.  I feel like my NR work is improving and the other area I'm really working on is stretching methods.  In this one I used ArcsinhStretch together with HT in imitation of \"noodle's\" outstanding M3 IOTD image...\r\n\r\nThis is Messier 10 in Ophiucus.  It is located approximately 14,000 ly away and contains approximately 100,000 stars.  \r\n\r\nComments, criticism always welcome and Clear Skies to everyone!!",
