    "description": "As much as I would like to lay claim to thinking this up, I am copying the approach adopted by Chris Go whose wonderful comparison image was so compelling. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\r\n\r\nI too downloaded a Perijove 26 image from the Juno website and processed it for comparison. I produced a polar projection of my image with WinJUPOS to make the comparison easier. and went with the planetographic rather than the planetocentric polar projection as it gives a more expanded view of the pole. \r\n\r\nMy image is 4 days and 10 rotations of the planet after the Perijove. The most notable difference to my eyes is that the dark spot on the p side of A8 ( the white spot to the lower right of the larger Oval BA in the image) has moved closer to it by the time my image was acquired. It also seems to have acquired a small tail, although there is hint of that in the Juno image.\r\nI hope you will enjoy the comparison of an image acquired 750  million kms from the planet versus one acquired 5000-10000 kms away. :-D",
