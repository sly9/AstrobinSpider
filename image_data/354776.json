    "description": "This is another version of NGC281 the Pacman Nebula in Cassiopeia. Going over all my old data to produce a combination of narrow band and RGB. Exposure time was 3 hours in each RGB and 7 and a half hours in H-alpha 1 hour 20mins in both OIII and SII. Total exposure time was 19 hours 10 mins. Imaged with my AG12 Newtonian and H35 camera by Starlight Xpress and My AG8 and H16 for the narrow band data.\r\nIve had lots of fun processing this one. I really love the look of the finished colour combination ...but it doesn't sit quite right with me as far as what IÂ  would call a 'correct' visual representation of the object....but its a nice effect.",
