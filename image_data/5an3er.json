    "description": "Here we have the Antennae Galaxies.  I find this to be a very interesting example of a galactic collision and this is at a particularly interesting stage in the millions of years long process.  It has been said that these two galaxies will complete their merger and will be a rather large elliptical in the future.  \r\n\r\nNGC4038 and NGC 4039 ar located in Corvus at about 45 million lys from us.\r\n\r\nThis object is rather low on the horizon from my location at almost exactly 33deg N latititude.  That means the imaging windows are short and I think the image has a more reddish cast resulting in shooting it at such a low angle.  I tried to be very subtle with the incorporation of the Ha data.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you like it, clear skies to all!",
