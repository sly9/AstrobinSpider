    "description": "Last night, the show was magnificent. The moon with earthshine and Venus was exceptionally close and practically on the same line, from my point of view. \r\n\r\nThe sun had set at 5:45 pm, and the moon, all pale at first, was entering the \"blue hour\". But you had to reckon with the clouds. There was one almost static and others were running at full speed. \r\n\r\nAmong the fifty shots, few were successful, cloud photography at night is not my strong point.\r\n\r\nAs I wanted to capture the earthshine, it was the 2-second exposure shot that worked better, but it had the effect of buzzing Venus, and create artifacts in the cloudy sky background.\r\n\r\nRetouching the image I could have removed the clouds and leave a solid background, but ultimately it is perhaps better with the clouds, even imperfect.",
