    "description": "I don't think I'll ever run out of great targets in Cygnus.  This is an image of Sh 2-115 and Sh 2-116 (Abell 71).  This region lies on the opposite side of Deneb from the North America and Pelican nebulae, slightly to the north and west of Deneb.  It is a very faint nebula, so I was happy with the amount of signal I was able to coax from the QHY600M camera.\r\n\r\nAs always, I appreciate your comments and criticisms.",
