    "description": "Composite image. Shot for several hours using a static tripod and Nikon D90 with Tokina 11-16 at 11mm f2.8, ISO800, 20sec. Background stars produced from integration of 125x20s star registered images combined with foreground from unregistered images. Meteors were selected and combined from the star registered images using substitute with preview and pixel math.  Couldn't include quite a few that were out of frame for the reference image used for registration.  It was a great show this year!",
