    "description": "Anteater nebula can be named boogie man nebula, and not just because it's shape. During my Namibian expedition it was the last object to shoot so if anything had been gone wrong, that would have meant that this whole session failed. And this almost happened. On the fist night of this object's session, 2 hours before dawn after the last focus check, I started the last exposition program and went to sleep 1,5-2 hours. When I woke up I just realized the MGen autogudier finished program but my camera only got the first expo signal due to a failed cable, so instead of 2 hours of 5 min exposures i got only one image 5300 sec of exposure and the trails of 17 dithering. That's why I only gathered 70 subs instead of the planned 100. On top of this, post procession was also struggling. It is difficult to keep focus both on dark and bright regions. After some attempt I decided to focus on dark nebulas instead of the contrast of bright reflection regions.\r\n\r\nScope: 200/800 SkyWatcher Newton\r\nMount: SkyWatcher NEQ6 pro upgraded\r\nGuiding: Lacerta MGen autoguider\r\nCamera: Canon EOS 600D\r\nExposure: 70*300sec ISO800\r\nDate: 2018.05.21\r\nLocation: Namibia - Isabis farm",
