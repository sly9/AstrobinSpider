This has limited my last two capture's exposure times.\r\n\r\nThis is 12 hours on M81 and M82 with Arp's Loop and other galactic cirrus as I recently learned the \"pros\" call it. (Rather than \"Integrated Flux Nebula\".)\r\n\r\nIt was challenging to pull down the noise in the IFN/cirrus. I made an attempt to learn some noise reduction in PI and gave up. Every time I try to understand a new procedure in PI I end up being reminded of this:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7G7xOG2Ag\">Turbo Encabulator</a>",
