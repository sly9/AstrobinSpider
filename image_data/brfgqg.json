    "description": "IC 2631 is a reflection nebula, a dust cloud that reflects light from a nearby star into space, creating a stunning light show.\r\n\r\nThis object is the brightest nebula in the Chamaeleon Complex, a large region of gas and dust clouds that harbors numerous newborn and still-forming stars.\r\n\r\nThe complex is located in the southern constellation Chamaeleon, approximately 500 light-years away.\r\n\r\nIC 2631 is illuminated by a very young star known as HD 97300.\r\n\r\nDespite its dominating presence, the heft of HD 97300 should be kept in perspective. It is a T Tauri star, the youngest visible stage for relatively small stars. As these stars mature and reach adulthood they will lose mass and shrink.",
