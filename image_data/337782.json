    "description": "4 young open clusters with B-type stars. Each reddened by differing levels of interstellar dust.\r\n\r\nNGC 581 M103 It is one of the most distant open clusters known, with distances of 8,000 to 9,500 light-years from the earth~3kpc. With stars ranging about 15 light-years apart. There are about 40 member stars within M103 a couple of them are 10th magnitude red giants. M103 is about 25 million years old.\r\n\r\nNGC 654.This is towrd the bottom left of this image. There is clear evidence for the presence of at least two layers of dust along the line of sight to the cluster. The reddening is clearly visible by eye when compairing this cluster to M103 in the upper center of this image. The distances to the two dust layers are estimated to be ∼200 pc and ∼1 kpc thus are located much closer to the Sun than the cluster (∼2.4 kpc).  The foreground dust layer is  found to have a ring morphology with the central hole coinciding with the centre of the cluster. This ring is again visible in the image above. The foreground dust grains are suggested to be mostly responsible for both the observed differential reddening of the cluster. \r\n\r\nNGC 663 cluster distance of 2.1 kpc, age of 20Myr. A collection of B type stars with slight reddening from intersetllar dust and clearly less than NGC 654 to its left. \r\n\r\nNGC 559 cluster is a distance of 1.1kpc this is the least prominant of the 4 clusters and on the lower right. It does however contain a number of variable stars recently discovered.",
