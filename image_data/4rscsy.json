    "description": "Here are quite a few galaxies from Friday night caught with the Meade 14\" and Sony A7s. I simultaneously imaged these galaxies with my Esprit 150 and my next post will be a more widefield composite image with data from both scopes. I run the SCT at its native FL, so 3550 mm (f/10), which means that these are quite small galaxies when seen from Earth ;-)",
