    "description": "This magnificent pair of galaxies also known as Antennae Galaxies, will become one after this dance which has lasted for more than one hundred million years. Their image reaches us over 75 million light years away. They are currently going through a \"starburst\" phase, in which the collision of clouds of gas and dust under the influence of dense magnetic fields causes the rapid formation of stars.\r\n\r\nA RHaGB combination",
