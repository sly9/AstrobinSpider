    "description": "I`ve found the interesting article about this nebula  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01350.pdf. \r\nIn the article in Chapter 4.2 you can see a description of multiple outer faint halo rings around the nebula. I was interested with that. I decided to take this nebula with a long exposure on a 40” telescope. The rings were worked out very well, also their centers are located close to the main star, but not exactly match with it. I represent the rings and their centers in the attachment. \r\n\r\nRings scheme is shown below\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/iokfgl/B/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/iokfgl/B/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical data:\r\n \r\nTelescope/lens: ASA 40\" Ritchey–Chretien\r\nCamera: FLI Proline 16803 CCD Camera\r\nExposure and filters: OIII H-alpha RGB 26 hours total exposure \r\nLocation: Chilescope observatory, Chile \r\nImage data acquired remotely\r\n2020\r\n\r\nProcessing diagram is shown below\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/iokfgl/C/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/iokfgl/C/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
