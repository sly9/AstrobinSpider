    "description": "The constellation of Perseus contains some extraordinary molecular clouds, many of which are areas of star formation. One of the very youngest in the Perseus OB2 association is NGC 1333. This beautiful nebula contains hundreds of stars that are as young as a million years old, and is one of the nearest star forming regions to us. The youngest of these protostars create outflows that collide with the surrounding medium to create Herbig-Haro objects. NGC 1333 is known to contain at least 36 of these HH objects and many of them can be seen in the bright red emission regions within NGC 1333.\r\n\r\nThe blue nebulae in this image are areas of dust that are reflecting the light from the hot blue stars in front of the dust. In addition to the reflection nebula within NGC 1333, this image also shows another reflection nebula, vdB 13 (blue nebula towards lower right).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this image shows several dark nebulae where the dust obscures the light behind it. As shown in the annotated version of this image, Barnard 205 is below NGC 1333, and just below vdb 13 is Barnard 203.\r\n\r\nVisible throughout this astrophoto is a portion of the large dusty Perseus OB2 molecular cloud. These clouds are an impressive dusty brown and are punctuated with regions of blue reflection nebulae as well.\r\n\r\nL - 600' x 50\r\nRGB - 300' x 12 each",
