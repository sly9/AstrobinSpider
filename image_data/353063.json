    "description": "The Rho Ohphiuchi Cloud Complex- A 9 Panel mosaic shot in Marathon Texas at the Marathon Motel & RV Park during the new moon in June over the course of 4 nights.  Some of the most beautiful colors in our galaxy are found in Scorpius around the Rho Ophiuchi Cloud Complex and I was happy to finally catch their photons on my telescope! \r\n\r\nTechnical Details:\r\n12 x 180s L\r\n12 x 180s R\r\n12 x 180s G\r\n12 x 180s B\r\n\r\nFlats taken after each session. Bias and Darks from my library.\r\n\r\nEquipment Dtails: \r\n2 x William Optics 132 FLT 5.5 Telescope w/ Flat 7 @ 5.6\r\nLum & Red shot on scope 1, Green and Blue shot on scope2\r\nAstro Physics 1100 GTO \r\nQHY 16200 x 2 \r\nQHY 5LII Guide Camera on WO 50mm Scope\r\n\r\nCalibrated, Combined, and Exported in Pixinsight. Levels and Color adjustment in Photoshop. Plate Solve from Pixinsight.\r\n\r\nPanel Process:\r\n-Dynamic crop per panel\r\n-Batch PreProcessing used to combine flats, darks, and bias frames. Cosmetic Correction used on each panel.\r\n-Dynamic Background adjustment per panel\r\n-Photometric Color Calibration per panel\r\n-Histogram Transformation applied \r\n-Noise Reduction via SCNR Green Channel\r\n-Export to master TIF for full color panel\r\n\r\nMosaic Process: \r\n-Each Channel solved via Image Solver in Pixinsight- Tedious but effective and ensures a valid plate solve.\r\n-Saved as .Tiff & .Xisf per channel\r\n-Mosaic By Coordinates Script ran on each channel master to create a master per channel.\r\n-EXTREMELY GOOD NOTES taken per panel for image center and Photometric Color Calibration (If you don't, you'll redo the process over and over- Sky Safari is your friend. \r\n-Combination via Gradient Merge Mosaic per channel\r\n-Optional combination of LRGB targets yield less color & slightly better combination to my eye. YMMV.",
