    "description": "M76, the Little Dumbbell Nebula, is a 10th magnitude planetary nebula in the constellation Perseus at a distance of 2500 light years.  One of the more difficult Messier objects to view visually, M76 only spans about 2.7 x 1.8 arcminutes. \r\n\r\nThis image was acquired with an 11\" SCT at f/10 and 2800 mm focal length using H-alpha and OIII narrowband filters, which required 20 minute subs.  Acquiring the data was challenging to say the least.",
