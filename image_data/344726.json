    "description": "* Image acquisition (Halpha) by<a href=\" https://www.astrobin.com/users/iosifbodnariu/\"> Iosif Bodnariu</a>.\r\n* Image acquisition (RGB) by Jim Misti / Steven Mazlin.\r\n* Image acquisition (Lum) by Liverpool Telescope.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* Distance: 27 Mly.\r\n\r\nThe Pinwheel Galaxy (NGC 5457 or M101) is a prominent spiral located about 27 million light-years away, in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major; has almost 200.000 light-years in diameter, making it one of the largest known and brightest in its group of galaxies, the M101 group.\r\n\r\nThe M101 presents an asymmetric geometry due to the tidal forces that it is subjected by its companion galaxies, which end up compressing the interstellar hydrogen, triggering strong star formation activity along the spiral arms. In the image it is possible to observe numerous HII regions along the spiral arms.\r\n\r\nThe red arrow points to SN 2011fe, initially designated PTF 11kly, a Type Ia supernova.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/292087/C/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/292087/C/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
