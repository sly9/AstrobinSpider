    "description": "NGC 281- HYBRID BICOLOR\r\nNGC 281, better known as the Pacman Nebula, is an interstellar cloud of ionized gas (emission nebula) located in the constellation of Cassiopeia. The nebula appears curiously furrowed by a dark region that crosses the object and also determines its shape.\r\nThis photograph was obtained with only signals in Ha (red ionized hydrogen) and in O-III (ionized oxygen) by combining the two mochromatic channels and obtaining a single photo in false colors. This false color image, obtained through appropriate post production processes, is also called two-color and is suitable for highlighting the distribution of gas.\r\nIt is a pity that the weather conditions did not allow us to collect further signals.\r\n\r\nHA (Emanuele La Barbera)\r\n-Skywatcher 130/650 pds\r\n-Skywatcher Heq-5 Rowan belt mod\r\n-ZWO ASI 183 mm pro\r\n-ZWO Asiair pro\r\n-Autoguide Omegon 80/400+ ZWO ASI 120 mc\r\n-EFW 8x 1.25\" with Astronomik H-alpha 6nm CCD\r\n-Coma corrector Baader MPCC\r\n-40x600s gain 120, temp -15°C +11x600s gain 200, temp -15°C, bin 2x2\r\n\r\nO-III (Alessio Pariani)\r\n-Sharpstar 100q\r\n-Ioptron CEM25P\r\n-Astrel Instrument AST8300X\r\n-Autoguide TS Optics 50mm guide scope+ZWO ASI 120 mm\r\n-4x1800\" , temp -10C, bin 1x1 + Astrodon O-III 3nm\r\n-USB_Focus v3 Robotic focuser\r\n\r\nLocation: Palermo and Busto Arsizio - Bortle Class 8\r\nSoftware: Pixinsight, Adobe Photoshop",
