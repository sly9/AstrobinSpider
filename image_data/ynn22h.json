    "description": "NGC 1398 is an isolated barred spiral galaxy with an interesting double ring structure and feathery spiral arms positioned further out. It is located 65 million light years from the Earth, in the constellation of Fornax and has an estimated diameter of 135,000 light years, making it around 35 percent larger than the Milky Way. Over 100 billion stars are in the galaxy.\r\nImaged in LRGB on our Officina Stellare RiDK 700 at El Sauce, Obstech, Chile\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\r\nSystem Control Software: Voyager by Leo Orazi",
