    "description": "An unbelievably dim supernova remnant, Abell 85. This is 20 hours of exposure in Ha/Oiii with RGB stars. It has taken over a year to edit this target, I had partially given up on ever getting something useful out of it long ago. I came back to visit it though last night when I was on an editing kick and wanted to see if a year had made a difference, and it sure did. Really happy with how this ended up looking in the end.",
