    "description": "Last year during the long rainy season I told myself I needed to do better. Stop rushing through my edits, and stop cutting my integration time short. I knew at that point that shortcuts weren't getting me anywhere, so I knuckled up and swore come fall, I'd be better.\r\n\r\nThis was the first image I shot that following season, and even though I won an APOD on my Pac-Man, I honestly think I'm more proud of this one. Maybe it's the beauty of the object, maybe it was because it was my first truly decent image, maybe I just like brown and blue lol. But I'm proud of this.\r\n\r\nMy original edit of the image had a fairly blaring mistake to those with a keen eye and I felt it held the photo back, so last night and this morning I sat down for a few hours and rebuilt the image from scratch. I'll post the original edit, as well as the revised edit so you can compare and tell me what you think of the new version. \r\n\r\nClear Skies all :D",
