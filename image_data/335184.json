    "description": "2/3 of the Leo triplet. M65 and M66 are relatively close together at 35 million light years away. Although this was part of a mosaic covering these two and NGC 3628, being ARP 16 and Arp 317, sever light pollution gradients meant an unsatisfying result. The bar of the nearly edge on M65 is visible, and the twisted internal structure of M66 is dotted with H2 regions.",
