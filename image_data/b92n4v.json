    "description": "After countless hours, I think I am finally 'done' with this photograph. \r\n\r\nIt was by far the most difficult target I've ever processed. Finding a way to combine the faint halo and bright core was one of the main challenges of this project. \r\n\r\nThe Hubble image of NGC 6543 clearly shows evenly spaced, concentric rings around the core. However, I was only able to find a couple amateur images that show these rings. This is where I initially hit a wall in my processing, I just couldn't bring them out. Luckily, I got some helpful advice from the community here and I was able to reveal several rings in the OIII data and one ring in the RGB data.\r\n\r\nAll data was drizzle stacked and deconvolved to enhance visibility of the core details.",
