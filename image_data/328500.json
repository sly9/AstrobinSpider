In this image  the seemingly flowing river of stars shows the plethora of beauty it has to offer.\r\n\r\nAs we are looking towards the very centre of our own Milky Way galaxy not only the countless nebulae inhabiting it are visible, in the lower left part also visible are the planets Mars (bright orange) and Saturn (right of Mars).\r\n\r\nAll this beauty combined is impressively massive: the Milky Way galaxy is between 400 billion and 780 billion times the mass of our Sun.",
