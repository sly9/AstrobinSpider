    "description": "Rosette Nebula (Bicolor)\r\nThe Rosette Nebula (other designation Caldwell 49) is a huge spherical H II region located near one end of a giant molecular cloud in the Monoceros region of the Milky Way Galaxy. The open star cluster NGC 2244 (aka Caldwell 50) is found within the nebulosity of the nebula and the stars of the cluster were formed from the nebula's matter.\r\nThe cluster and nebula lie at a distance of  approximately 5,000 light-years from us and measure about 130 light years in diameter. The radiation from the young stars excites the atoms within the nebula which in turn causes them to emit a glow of visible radiation producing the emission nebula we see. The mass of the nebula has been estimated to be about 10,000 times the mass of our sun.\r\nAcquisition Date: October 24, 2017 \r\nLocation: Western Massachusetts\r\nCamera: SBIG STF8300M @ -15Â°C\r\nTelescope: Telescope: Takahashi FSQ106EDX-III @f/5\r\nMount: Astro-Physics AP1100\r\nGuide scope: Off Axis Guiding \r\nGuide Camera: Starlight Express Lodestar 2\r\n\r\nFilters:\t\t\r\n-\tHA (3nm Astrodon)\t12 x 30 min.
