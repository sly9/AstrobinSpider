    "description": "One of the most beautiful nebulae in the Northern Hemisphere, in my opinion, Melotte 15 is situated 7500 ly away in Cassiopeia and contains a star cluster which is 1.5 million years old (Source: APOD). Melotte is a catalogue of star clusters, containing 245 such objects (and one galaxy M57). It was created by (no suprise) Melotte,  Philibert Jacques for his friends. \r\n\r\nThe project was partly shot close to the full moon and I couldn't complete the O3 data due to delays in acquisitions during the night. They were caused by the autofocus process (it is totally incomprehensible how something that usually works flawlessly, now took a long time finding correct focus even when the first autofocus was successful). In spite of this, I think it is the best image I produced with the Newtonian so far. The nebula is full of smaller clouds visible through the transparency the oxygen layer, especially in full resolution.  The contrast with the darker filaments is what fascinates me about this object and of course the swan - like clouds that arise from the ocean of oxygen.",
