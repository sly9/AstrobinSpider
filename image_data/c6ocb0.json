    "description": "The data for this image was acquired partially in 2017 and then later in 2019 from Class 4 Bortle skies, west and north of Milwaukee, WI.  In total:\r\n\r\nL: 23@600s\r\nR: 7@600s\r\nG: 7@600s\r\nB: 17@600s\r\n\r\nProcessed using PixInsight as a traditional image and then used Starnet++ which worked wonders to produce what you see here.  I was amazed at how much more dust and dark nebula was visible without the stars to distract your eye.\r\n\r\nEquipment was as follows:\r\nStellarvue SVAT130 at f/5\r\nHypertuned Celestron CGEM DX mount\r\nQSI690-wsg8 w/ Astrodon filters (autoguide camera was Lodestar X2)\r\nCaptured using Sequence Generator Pro and processed in PixInsight",
