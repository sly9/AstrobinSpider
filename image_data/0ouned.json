    "description": "First time I tried this stunning edge on galaxy. On this image I tested working with binning 2x2 which is new for me. I think I should have tried earlier, cause I am happy with the result. Especially the color shots were easier to manage with exposure times. For luminace I took again my ccd cls filter, which helps a little against the city lights. Nearly 40% of the images were exposed through some tree branches and I wondered how less this disturbed the sub while controling it with sharpcap in live stacking view. Hope you like the color setting....",
