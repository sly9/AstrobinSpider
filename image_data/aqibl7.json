    "description": "I've been learning a lot more about PixInsight by carefully reading through Rogelio Bernal Andreo's EXCELLENT new book on PI.  Highly recommended.  Just out so only available in pdf download, but soon to be printed I believe.  Anyway, I learned that the stretching process \"ArcsinhStretch\" was designed to preserve star colors.  So, I tried it on my Blue Horse image, but found it rendered saturated stars with a pinkish middle.  To mitigate that, I did a partial stretch with HistogramTransformation, then finished the stretch with ArcsinhStretch.  That still pretty much preserved star colors but largely got the pink out, for a more natural result.  Then I split the image into stars/no stars with Starnet, shrunk the stars via MorphologicalTransform, then recombined for a less star-intensive result.",
