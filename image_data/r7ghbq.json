    "description": "A composite mosaic of the best images I captured during the Super Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse\n\nFar left is a little bit before the eclipse began moving through the different stages to its peak on the far right.\n\nI've never photographed and processed the moon like this before and was quite worried leading up to the night - and even during it - that things weren't going to turn out well. With this being the first eclipse I've ever had the chance to see, it wasn't an opportunity I wanted to mess up!\n\nI decided to use my mono 294MM and captured 100 frame videos for each filter throughout the evening. Maintaining a good enough focus and modifying exposure times as the moon went from very bright to almost dark and then a wonderful red glow was a bit of a juggling act while trying to catch as much of the eclipse as I could with the naked eye.\n\nI figured out a couple of new pieces of software to process and stack all the images (PiPP and AS!3) and then combined and edited them in PixInsight. The relief!! They weren't horrible! I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.",
