    "description": "My favorite area within the Vela SNR, and a nebula that truly does look like what its name suggests, a pencil! The contrast between the blue and red is just so great to see, especially the wisps just below the pencil itself. I had never even noticed those before working on this image. RGB data was used for the stars, surprisingly easy to blend this time around, or maybe I am just getting better at it haha.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking :)",
