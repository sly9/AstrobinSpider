    "description": "Not a great image as I was limited to one night of data (only 15 lum)  plus the object only gets to 36 degrees in elevation.   Plus, seeing was poor thus I decided to try imaging the luminance data binned 2x2 but blew the stars out as the subs were too long.  L 15x 150s 2x2 binned, RGB 10x100s 3x3 binned.",
