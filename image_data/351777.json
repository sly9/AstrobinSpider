    "description": "I started the cat's eye using the svq100, which was a REAL stretch for it.. then i came across a MN190 and pounced on it :)\r\n\r\nmuch better match.. of course, i've never imaged with anything other than a refractor, so to say i was in for a \"learning curve\" would be a huge understatement.. \r\n\r\nthankfully the Atlas doesn't seem to mind the extra weight at all ( where's some wood.... )",
