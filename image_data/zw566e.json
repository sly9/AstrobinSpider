    "description": "NGC 225 is an open cluster NGC about 2,000 light years \r\naway in the constellation Cassiopeia and was discovered by \r\nCaroline Herschel in 1783. The cluster is very young with an \r\nestimated age of only one to 10 million years.\r\nOne of it's stars, the variable star V594 Cas, illuminates \r\nthe blue reflection nebula van den Bergh (vdB) 4, which also \r\ncataloged as LBN 604. It seems, that vdB 4 is a remnant from \r\nthe cloud that formed the cluster.",
