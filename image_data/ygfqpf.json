    "description": "The Gem Cluster NGC 3293 is a massive open cluster with over 100 B-stars. It is located at the border of an H2 region, Gum 30. The other H2 region in the image is Gum 31 with the embedded cluster GC 3324. In the center of NGC 3324 is the star system HD 92206 with 3 massiv O-stars that deliver the energy for the surrounding emission nebula.\r\n\r\nThese H2 clouds are part of the larger Carina Nebula Complex, located northwest of Eta Carinae.\r\n\r\nAbove the Gem cluster is a small, round nebula with the star HD 92383 in its center.\r\n\r\nImage acquisition: 60x30s for Red, Green and Blue with Sequence Generator Pro and PHD2.\r\nStacks: AstroPixelProcessor\r\nLinear Processing: Pixinsight\r\nNon-Linear Processing: Photoshop\r\n\r\nThis is the second version of this cluster, this time without any narrowband data.",
