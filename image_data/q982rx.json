    "description": "Tarantula Nebula and part of the Large Magellanic Cloud\r\n\r\nThe Tarantula Nebula is more than a thousand light-years in diameter, a giant star forming region within our nearby satellite galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud, about 180 thousand light-years away. It's located in the southern constellation Dorado. The largest, most violent star forming region known in the whole Local Group of galaxies. \r\n\r\nThere is a young cluster of massive stars in the centre of the Tarantula which is responsible for intense radiation, stellar winds and supernova shocks. It energizes the nebular glow and shapes the spidery filaments. Around the Tarantula are other star forming regions with young star clusters, filaments, and blown-out bubble-shaped clouds. In fact, the frame includes the site of the closest supernova in modern times, SN 1987A, right of center. If Tarantula Nebula was closer, say 1,500 light-years distant like the local star forming Orion Nebula, it would take up half the sky!\r\n\r\nI used a Telescope.Live, Takahashi FSQ-106ED to photograph this magnificent object. One of my most favourite so far amongst the images I have acquired using Telescope.Live robotic telescopes.\r\n\r\nHAlpha - 2x300\r\nOIII - 2x300\r\nSII- 2x300\r\nRed - 2x300\r\nGreen - 2x300\r\nBlue- 2x300\r\n\r\nPixInsight - PixMath Combination\r\nRed - 0.1*Red + 0.9*HAlpha \r\nGreen - 0.1*Green  + 0.9*OIII\r\nBlue - 0.4*Blue + 0.6*SII\r\n\r\nPorcessing: PixInsight, GIMP and DeepSkyStacker\r\n\r\nDate: 05 Jan 2021\r\n\r\nTelescope.Live, Heaven's Mirror Observatory, Australia\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ-106ED\r\nAperture: 106 mm\r\nFocal Length: 382 mm\r\nF-ratio: 3.6 (with 0.73x focal reducer)\r\nCamera: FLI PL16083\r\nPixel Size: 9 Î¼m\r\nPixel Array: 4096 x 4096\r\nPixel Resolution: 4.74 arcsec/pixel\r\nCooling: -25 degrees\r\nFilters: Astrodon LRGB 2GEN, Ha (3nm), SII (3nm), OIII (3nm);",
