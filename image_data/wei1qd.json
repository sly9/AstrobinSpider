    "description": "When you think of Texas, I would venture a guess that you wouldn't think of snow. It snows in the Northern U.S. (quite a lot in some states) but I think most would agree that Texas and snow are normally not associated with one another. If I told you that Texas can be described as a winter wonderland, I bet you'd look at me like I was crazy! Well that's exactly the description I would use to narrate the scene at the lovely Farrell Ranch in East Central Texas this past weekend (Bortle 3!). Don't believe me? Have a look at the second revision of the Dolphin Nebula (picture courtesy of Farrell Ranch)! As beautiful as this scene may appear, the snow storm almost ruined my attempt to capture this delightful target appearing just below the star Sirius in the constellation Canis Major! Luckily our very gracious hosts let us come up a bit early and for that I am very grateful because I would have been imaging snow clouds come Sunday!\r\n\r\nI wanted to image this challenging target for 2 reasons:\r\nNumber 1 - It looks really cool\r\nNumber 2 - I wanted to print it out and give it to my father-in-law... Why you ask would he want a picture of the Dolphin Head Nebula? You didn't hear it from me, but his middle name is \"Dolphin.\" ;)\r\n\r\nThanks Farrell Ranch for another awesome trip!",
