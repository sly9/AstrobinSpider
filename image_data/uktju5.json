    "description": "IC410 is a large (55'x55') emission nebula in the constellation Auriga. \r\nThis nebula is often called the Tadpoles Nebula due to two rather evident filaments, also identified as Simeis 129 and 130. \r\nThe open cluster NGC 1893 is superimposed on the nebula, formed by young massive stars rather scattered which ionize the gases of the nebula: the whole region is still the site of star formation processes. \r\nThe estimated distance of the entire complex is about 19,500 light years. \r\nThis image was obtained from a city sky heavily polluted by artificial lights (18.5 Mag / Sq Arcsec at zenith) thanks to the use of narrow band filters.",
