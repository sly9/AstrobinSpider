    "description": "Hey guys and girls,\r\nAnother image rework of the Rho Uphiuchi. This time as a panorama.\r\nI finished working on this picture a long time ago. At my picture exhibition in 2019, someone wanted to buy the large 6 panel mosaic by Rho Uphiuchi.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/377795/E/?image_list_page=2&nc=&nce=\r\n\r\nBut since this was already sold, I made a new one with a different image detail. It still hangs in his living room today what makes me really happy!\r\nThe image print is 250cm x 70cm. :)\r\n\r\nLeft Panel: 10.08.2018     13x300sec   iso 800\r\nRight Panel: 12.08.2018    12x300sec   iso 800",
