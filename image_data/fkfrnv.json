    "description": "M51, the Whirlpool Galaxy. A dance of destruction for one Galaxy and new birth for another. I imaged this with my Edge 8hd to get in as close as I could to show galactic structure in the image. I never had time to capture Ha due to weather, but maybe a future image revision. I struggled producing an image I was happy with, I'm really missing the Ha, but I still think I was able to deliver the detail I was looking for in this version. \r\n\r\nWhirlpool Galaxy lies 31 million light-years from Earth and has an estimated diameter of 76,000 light-years. Overall the galaxy is about 43% the size of the Milky Way. Its mass is estimated to be 160 billion solar masses or around 10.3% of the mass of Milky Way Galaxy.\r\n\r\nThank you for looking!\r\n\r\nCS\r\nDan.",
