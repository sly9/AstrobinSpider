    "description": "Camera: Pentax K-1\r\nLens: Rokinon 135mm F2 @ f5.6\r\nGuided with pentax 300mm F4.5\r\nMount: Celestron AVX\r\nISO: 3200\r\nExposure: 60 seconds\r\n\r\nSky:  Tracked. 9 frames manually stacked using median mode Photoshop CS6. Gradient filters were used to minimize orange color on the horizon.\r\n\r\nForeground:   Tripod. Captured with multiple shots taken at different focus points and manually focus stacked to keep every thing sharp. Dunes were lit from the right to accentuate ripples in the sand.\r\n\r\nSky and foreground manually blended and processed in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nSand dunes are tricky to photograph. you have to find a composition that is acceptable and settle for it!  You can't walk forward for a possible better composition because you will leave footprints in the sand which will ruin the composition.\r\n\r\nThis is a much smaller version of original file which is about 40 MP",
