    "description": "This image contains a sprawl of fascinating objects along the edge of the Taurus molecular cloud, located 500 light-years away. The highlight of the image for me is the numerous dark nebulae.  Barnard 7 is the vertical dark nebula comprised of a series of dark patches at the right center.  LDN 1495 is the vertical dark nebula extending to the upper left, Barnard 209 is the dark nebula at the lower left, and Barnard 214 is the dark nebula at upper right.  The galaxy IC 359, 180 million light years from earth, is at the lower left corner.  It is the dominant galaxy in the LDC 290 galaxy group, of which numerous faint galaxies can be seen in the vicinity of IC 359.   Cederblad 30 is the blueish reflection nebula at right center.  Finally, three young T-Tauri class stars, emerging from the remnants of their birth clouds, can be seen illuminating reflection nebulae at the lower left, center, and top right of the image.",
