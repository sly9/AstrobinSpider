    "description": "IC 1396A also commonly known as the “Elephant Trunk Nebula” is a star forming region some 2,400 Light Years from earth. The bright rim is the surface of the dense cloud that is being illuminated and ionized by a bright, massive star. The Nebula is now thought to containing several very young stars less than 100,000 yr old.  Presented in the hubble pallet also known as SHO which stands for Sulfur-Hydrogen-Oxygen.  I am really happy with the results of this image as this target is rich in all gasses!
