    "description": "This is a portion of the wonderful 4 panel Hubble data set from the WFC3 instrument package that was released a few years ago.   This image is composed of three emission line filter images – N II, Hydrogen alpha and O III – which were then mapped to red, green and blue respectively and then combined as a false color image.\r\n\r\nThis is my processing of the Hubble Telescope data of the Bubble Nebula. The mosaic data was released in May 2016 and can be found at this link if you want to try processing it --> https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/heritage/bubble/introduction.html",
