    "description": "After 6 weeks of clouds, I finally got a small window to shoot some new data. Two partially clear but very humid nights, and one clear night with terrible seeing. Longer nights in Autumn are fun until your mirrors fog up with dew :) Therefore, only 12 hours of usable data on this one.\r\n\r\nI initially didn't plan on publishing this, since the optics are still not performing properly and the sharpness wasn't really good due to the seeing. That said, the final integration packed quite a good amount of signal in all channels and it was surprisingly easy to bring out strong color separation in the tone map. The SII filter definitely adds a lot of value to this object, there's a lot more tonal variety possible compared to my bicolor image from early 2019. FITs are linked below the image title.",
