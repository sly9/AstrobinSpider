    "description": "Many people do not know that the Orion Nebula and the Horsehead Nebula are fairly close to each other. These are some of the first images I have processed from my new Raptor 61 telescope. It is my first refractor, and am pleased so far. I was happy to see that I could fit both of these iconic nebulae into a single frame (Crop sensor at 275mm focal length).",
