    "description": "For this project I set out to create a desktop background which could span two 4K monitors. I also wanted to convey a sort of sunset color palette. The California Nebula seems like the ideal choice for this. I used PI to pre-process the subframes into channel masters for each frame and then used Astro Pixel Processor to stitch the mosaic together. Histogram transformation was done in PixInsight and then I exported into LightRoom for color and contrast enhancements and noise reduction. \r\n\r\nThe final aspect ratio is twice the full frame field which is 6x2. \r\n\r\nAs always comments and critiques are very welcome.",
