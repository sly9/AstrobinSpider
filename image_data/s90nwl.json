    "description": "Lying approximately 8,500 light-years from Earth, the Carina Nebula (NGC 3372) is a very large complex of bright and dark nebulosity.   This image is a blended version of NB data and Broadband data taken with the TOA-150/FLI ML16200 at Deep Sky West-Chile.  I don't know how many different blending variations I made, but I settled on this one to show the blues from the OIII along with the preponderance of reds from the massive amount of Ha.\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\nTom",
