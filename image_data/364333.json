    "description": "After observing M102, I hunted around nearby and found these two beautiful galaxies. Wow. seeing and transparency was pretty darn good, as was everything else, so I it was worthwhile to capture these at bin1 or around 0.5 arc seconds per pixel.\r\nThese are now on my re-image list for the next time I get out to a dark sky site. I think the outer regions of NGC5905 will be particularly improved. These areas are difficult to separate from the sky glow in my Portland metro area backyard. No filters other than a  IR cut filter here. The transparency was so good that I decided to go without my light pollution filter.\r\nAlso check out the little irregular galaxy above the edge on, NGC5908. I think its PGC 54557.",
