    "description": "Back in early June, I collected 5 and a bit hours of Ha using my dual WO Star 71 Rig.  The plan was to collect 5 hours of each of SII and OIII to go with the Ha.  I got 3 hours of each by the end of June and since then the weather has not played ball.  So, I decided to go ahead and process what I had.  Those Star 71s give a good wide field.  ",
