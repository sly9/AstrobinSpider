    "description": "Messier 31 is hard to get with a 300mm newtonian  f/4 without  a large field camera , but it still needs 2 panels (at least ) .\r\n\r\nM31 is really for me like a mystical object , the closest galaxy to us (put  apart  these Magellanic clouds and some dwarf galaxies)\r\nI had made it in my youth on a Schmidt 203mm (not cassegrain , it was necessary to cut the film and put it in a base then fix it in the center of the central spider) on Technical Pan 2415 hyper sensitized in 1982 and therefore in B&W\r\n …. Anyway, I like this color version better :-) and on the Newton 300, it allows you to find some details in dark clouds in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\nMosaic of 2 panels \r\n8 nights : 21,22,23,24,25, 26, 28 August\r\n\r\n\r\n80 Light subs @180s gain zero and -10°C and\r\n62  Halpha subs @300s gain 139 and -10°C and\r\n40 Blue subs @180s gain zero and -10°C\r\n40 Green subs @180s gain zero and -10°C\r\n40 Red subs @180s gain zero and -10°C",
