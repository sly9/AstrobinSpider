    "description": "Thor's helmet is a bubble of ionised hydrogen 12000 light years away in the constellation Canis Major. Providing the ionising radiation is a Wolf Rayet star, catalogued as WR7.\r\nThe curved wings of the helmet are unusual for this type of object and are believed to be caused by the interaction of the interstellar medium and the outflow from the star.",
