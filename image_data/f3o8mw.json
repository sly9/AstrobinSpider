    "description": "I lost all of my images with the recent AB data loss. An image of the Triangulum Galaxy I shot back in 2017 was the last I needed to find and reload. Upon tracking down the files I discovered luminance and Ha data that I had acquired in 2019 that I had intended to combine with the original DSLR data, but had never accomplished. What better time than now. This new Triangulum Galaxy image combines 3 hours of DSLR data (Canon 70d full spectrum mod) with 3.6 hours of luminance and 1.5 hours of Ha acquired with an ZWO ASI1600 Pro. So for me the data loss had the happy outcome of the rediscovery of unprocessed data lost in the depth of my hard drive. Yes, I’m a \"silver lining” guy.",
