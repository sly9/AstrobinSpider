    "description": "Revision C: (HaL)RGB image. I finally managed to collect just enough data (about 12 hours of Ha and L) of a close-up of the IC434, the Horsehead Nebula at 0.7arcsec per pixel. The RGB data was collected with a smaller scope, at half focal length at 2.0arcsec per pixel, so it was almost like it was 2x2 binned.\r\n\r\nRevision B: The blended Ha+L image used for Luminance. I have collected 2.5hours of L in order to get the beautiful NGC2023. Mouse over Revision B to compare the L and the (HaL)RGB images",
