    "description": "First time imaging M78. \r\nFirst time imaging in RGB.\r\nFirst time imaging away from the city - Bortle9. \r\nFirst time imaging under dark skies- Bortle2!.\r\n\r\nSo many things that could go wrong, and many went wrong. The extremely short summer nights made it even more difficult. But all in all, I managed to capture 4 hours of data. So here's my first attempt at RGB on this beautiful nebula. Hope you guys like it.\r\nClear skies everybody!",
