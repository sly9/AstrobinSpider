    "description": "Hey Kids! I was finally able to get a shot of the biggest sun spot in quite some time. I'm sure this is no surprise to any of you. The conditions were iffy at best, but I managed to grab 5000 frames at 85fps and here is the result. I did shoot an animation but I am still working on it. I don't know if it's going to be presentable becasue of the questionable conditions. I'm on my third processing try, the first 2 sucked. Enjoy what I did get though...",
