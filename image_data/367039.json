    "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI began this project during this summer.\r\nI've first made a 3 tiles mosaic in cygnus with my A7s, Samyang 135 and STC duo narrowband filter (you can see it in a previous picture).\r\nNow I've had 5 more tiles.\r\nFor each tile : 155 x 30 sec at 3200 ISO, lens at f2.\r\nThis picture is 70% from original.\r\n\r\nThe processing is 100% done with PixInsight.\r\nThe result is not perfect (some merging artifact are remaining) and the color rendering may not be to everyone's taste, but I'm quite satisfied.\r\nIt's a long and tough work to create such mosaic.\r\nI hope you like it.\r\n\r\nCS, David.",
