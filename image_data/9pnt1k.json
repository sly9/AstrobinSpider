    "description": "Very rarely imaged target for some reason. I was always noticing it on wide field images of the MW (like in my recent image <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/cp7z1f/\">here</a>) and decided to give it a try with a longer FL.\r\n\r\nPretty dim, so it would definitely appreciate more integration time, but I got what I got. Not a lot of details here (maybe more integration will show additional details, but I don't think there is too much more: although I saw fantastic deep images in hydrogen like <a href=\"https://www.mdwskysurvey.org/recent-highlights?pgid=iw2583if-72139e4c-9e64-4417-9e09-998bf37bcd79\">here</a> I doubt that those details can be really picked up with wide band filters). I like the combination of dust clouds and emission nebulae. Also, if you look closely, you can notice a tiny wisp of reflection nebula just around ζOph. I also like how the dust on the left kinda resembles the letter ζ.\r\n\r\nRevision B shows starless version, check it out, it shows <b>a lot</b> more nebulosity. \r\n\r\nPS. Now I definitely know how to remove stars from images (lol) and how to put them back, but I still have no idea how to turn them into nice and colorful ones instead of dull blobs that I always get with this setup. Any recommendations and suggestions are welcome!",
