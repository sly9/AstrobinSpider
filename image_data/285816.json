    "description": "NGC 2371 / 2372 is an 11th magnitude planetary nebula in the constellation Gemini.  Measuring only 1.0 arcminute in diameter, this target requires a night with good seeing to resolve the finer details.  This is a bicolor narrowband image shot from the city with OIII mapped to luminance, blue, and green, and H-alpha mapped to red.   \r\n\r\nI would have put more integration time into this target, but the seeing was really good on the first night, and I did not want to degrade the data.",
