    "description": "August 10, 2020 - the first Night at Tenerifes famous Roques de Garcia. While there was still a low crowd of stargazers for the upcoming Meteor Shower - I was able to sneak into the middle of these weird looking lava rocks with my camera. In the end, I spent all night at the same spot because the amount of possible composition made me walking on air. \r\n\r\nSince I am mostly getting stucked in more time-consuming long exposure panoramas instead of shot and run adventures, I was forced to stay there until moon rise and got more and more fascinated by the ghost-face-like looking caves of the Roque Las Cuevos - the Rock of Caves. \r\n\r\nDamn that was creepy and hard work, but the scenery with the Milky Way behind and being the lucky child with a beautiful Perseids Meteor in front of the Rho Ophiuchi region makes this panorama one of my favourites so far! Itâ€™s made of 12 single images in a 3x4 pattern, tracked with my Vixen Polarie Star Tracker and 60s exposures. The Shooting Star runned into frame of my untracked foreground exposure and was added to the exact position afterwards \r\n\r\nSocial Media @ martinlovekosi \r\n\r\nEXIF: \r\nPanorama / Tracked\r\n12 Frames\r\nNikon D800a + Af-S 50mm \r\nISO 2000 - f/2.5 - 60s",
