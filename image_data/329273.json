    "description": "Alcyone, Merope, Maia are highlighted here.  3 of the 7 sisters of Pleiades.  These 3 hot, blue, spectral class A stars are surrounded by numerous others that are  part of this open cluster of close to 1000 stars.   A little more than 400 ly away, the cluster is thought to have formed within the last 100 million years.  Therefore the dramatic wisps of dust surrounding the stars are most likely not part of the Nebula from which they formed, but rather, interstellar dust that has intersected Pleiades and created this beautiful scene.   The dust is thought to be primarily in two separate planes, which accounts for the dramatic wisps in differing directions.\r\n\r\nAs I consider the beauty of this scene, I am reminded of a comment made by Dante…\r\n\r\n“The heavens call to you, and circle about you, displaying to you their eternal splendors and your eye gazes only to earth”      (Dante Alighieri, Purgatorio, p.153, Princeton University Press)\r\n\r\nA good reminder for me to keep looking up :-)\r\n\r\nImage acquisition information:\r\n\r\nDate: November 2017\r\nLocation:  Fairview, UT\r\nTelescope: AT RC 16 Telescope with AP .75 reducer, F/6\r\nCamera:  Canon 6D\r\nExposure: 17 x 600s (170 minutes)\r\nMount: Astro Physics 1600",
