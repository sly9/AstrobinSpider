    "description": "this is a rather faint nebulosity a little west of Gamma Cas, the star called Navi (but should read Ivan,  a joke by astronaut Gus Grissom that became a standard name, as you can read in the \"Annals\" ). I spotted it at one of my widefields with 85mm, which has not got processed so far - but I noted that tiny smudge might be something interesting. \r\n\r\nIt's a HII region embedded in a dust lane of the milky way dubbed LDN1317, at a distance of 4700 lightyears. One of these little stallar factories, it contains a star cluster visible only in IR.\r\n\r\nLRGB with Moravian G2-8300 on Lacerta Photonewton 10\" f/4",
