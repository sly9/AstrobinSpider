    "description": "This 2-panel mosaic span from the nothern part of Saggitarius to southern parts of Scutum and Serpens, showing some well-known objects such as the Lagoon and Trifid nebulas (M8, M20) (bottom right), the Omega and Eagle nebulas (M17, M16) (upper center), the open clusters M23 and M25 (left and right of center), the globular clusters M22 and M28 (left bottom) and the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud (M24) (center). Also, many dark nebulas seems to overimpose, creating the effect of a dust lane from the top center to the lower right, with many wisps and \"brush-strokes\" around. \r\n\r\nThe individual panel were shot past mid august so I had to split the sequences in two (consecutive) nights so the frames were not too low in altitude. \r\n\r\n135mm, f/2.8, ISO2000\r\nPanel 1: 31x 120s (2020-08-18)\r\nPanel 2: 30x 120s (2020-08-19)",
