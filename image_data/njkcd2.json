    "description": "This is my first attempt at NGC 1333, though I've been wanting to capture it for quite a while.   I love the chaotic storm raging in the heart of the cloud surrounding the reflection nebula.  But, the clouds and the weather here on Earth had it in for this target.  I had to throw away a great many subs over multiple sessions due to high clouds, terrible gradients from the moon, then more clouds, even during times when the forecast was for clear skies!\r\n\r\nSo, in the end, I processed it but I'm not quite satisfied with it.  I am moving on and will revisit it at a later time if the weather doesn't clear up.  I may post a revision if I'm able to gather more RGB subs to bring down the noise before the target is out-of-reach this season.\r\n\r\nGotta love Maine weather.\r\n\r\nCS, Ara",
