    "description": "Jupiter on the morning of Sat 13 April (Canberra time).\r\n\r\nIt was going to be my main collimation session following first SCT optics cleaning in six years of use. Set my alarm for 2.30 am (much easier to do on the weekend) and used on screen preview to fine tune secondary alignment, adjusting sharpness with zero-shift focuser. I had removed corrector plate for isopropyl alcohol and distilled water treatment as it had quite a lot of pollen / water spots on it.. wanted to make sure all stains are removed in a controlled environment.\r\n\r\nSeeing was fair to good early on but crashed one hour before sunrise. Luckily I did have enough time to complete the task before the plate started to fog up (conditions are becoming more humid now). Although strong jet stream was prevalent, I did manage to record two short lived periods of relative stillness.. here's the first one centred on 17:10 UTC. Descent amount of detail can be seen with South Polar Red Spot approaching CM.\r\n\r\nWinJUPOS derotation of four 600 frame stacks, covering period between 3:06:25 and 3:14:11 am local time. FireCapture v2.6, individual video clips 80 second in duration.",
