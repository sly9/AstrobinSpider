    "description": "This is a two-panel mosaic of the North America and Pelican Nebulae.  The Pelican data was captured in June 2017, the North America in August 2017.\r\n\r\nThe objects are emission nebulae in the constellation of Cygnus.  They are located some 1,600 light years from earth.\r\n\r\nI have processed this previously, but this is a substantial revision including restacking subs and using a different crop.  Furthermore, the bulk of the processing was done by Lis.\r\n\r\nTechnical details:\r\n\r\nWilliam Optics Star 71 x 2\r\nMoravian G2-8300 x2\r\nMix of Astrodon and Chroma filters\r\nHa - 32 x 12000s = 10 hours 40 mins\r\nOIII - 24 x 1200s = 8 hours\r\nSII - 24 x 1200s = 8 hours\r\n\r\nA total of 26 hours 40 mins exposure time",
