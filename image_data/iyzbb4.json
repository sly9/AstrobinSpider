    "description": "Sh2-78 (Sharpless 2-78) is an old planetary nebula, also designated CTSS3, which was only recognized as a PN in 1990, though it was cataloged by Sharpless decades earlier as an HII region.\r\nThe Ha is stronger than the Oiii but both register well, and a pure RGB image shows no sign of the PN.\r\nThis PN is very rarely imaged.  This is only the second on Astrobin, the first is from jerryyyyy, a very nice rendition.\r\n\r\nMy Collections:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae (Complete)</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2627/\" target=\"_new\">Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2626/\" target=\"_new\">Galaxies</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2625/\" target=\"_new\">Sharpless 2 Objects</a>",
