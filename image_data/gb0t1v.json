    "description": "This happy little fellow is the planetary nebula NGC 246 discovered by William Herschel in 1785.  The Skull Nebula is located in the constellation Cetus.  From our vantage point, it has an angular resolution of just 3.7 arcmin.   The estimated diameter is about 2.3 light-years, and is 1,600 light-years from our planet.  It has a fairly low surface brightness at around 11th magnitude.   Quite often, visual observers can find the foreground stars overpowering when trying to locate this planetary nebula.  The central star is fairly bright at 11.8 magnitude.  The eastern limb of the nebula is brighter suggesting that it is interacting with the interstellar medium.   This is an excellent example of how some objects exhibit bow waves truly reflecting the dynamics of the interstellar medium.\r\n\r\nI tried to capture the ethereal shell of this planetary nebula.  It reminds me of a crystal sphere just hanging in space.  The teal and red colours of the planetary really seem to add an element of extra depth to the image.\r\n\r\nInstruments:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\nBaader Planetarium O-III 8.5 Narrowband-Filter\r\n \r\nExposure Details:\r\n62 X 900 Bin 1X1 Lum\r\n25 X 450 Bin 2X2 Red\r\n22 X 450 Bin 2X2 Green\r\n20 X 450 Bin 2X2 Blue\r\n5 X 900 Bin 1X1 Ha\r\n10 X 900 Bin 1x1 OIII\r\n\r\nLocation\r\nAustralia, Central Victoria\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.",
