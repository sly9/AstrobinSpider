    "description": "NGC 3576 is a bright nebula approximately 9,000  light years from Earth, and can be seen in the constellation Carina. It is popularly known as the 'The Statue of Liberty Nebula'  because of its distinctive appearance.   \r\n\r\nAlso seen in the image is NGC 3603 (on the left), possibly the most massive visible HII cloud of glowing gas and  in the Milky Way.  The nebula is a star forming region and surrounds a very dense cluster of stars.\r\n\r\nThis image was processed in PixInsight using the Hubble palette (Red = SII, Green = Ha, Blue = OIII). The final image was re-sampled by 120% for aesthetic reasons.",
