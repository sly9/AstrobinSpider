    "description": "My image shows the well known double cluster h&chi, which I had chosen as firstlight for my new Takahashi Epsilon 130D. My primary goal was to test the quality of the stars. Then I had the idea to test the enormous light sensitivity of the optics and to make the (very weak) existing hydrogen parts in this region visible. An extremely long exposure (11 hours at f/3.3) only for H-Alpha then enabled me to take this photo after an elaborate levelling of the background and mixing into the red channel. \r\n\r\nSo far there is only a very limited number of images that show the double cluster embedded in the red H-Alpha structures. Preserving the natural colors of the stars was a big challenge for me. But I think that the effort was worth it. :-)",
