    "description": "Dec 2, 2020 - AR2786 Sunspot again\r\n\r\nTo be honest nothing really fancy in fact my first attempt had more activities where I captured a huge solar flare, so I recaptured the same sunspot but this time I made few improvements as described below\r\n\r\n1) Used a 5x barlow instead of 2.5x\r\n2) Moved the telescope way back away from the power lines to get a cleaner timelapse\r\n3) Captured Flats and used AS3 to create/apply the MasterFlat which cleaned each frame\r\n4) Used imPPG software to enhance each frame using the Deconvolution, Unsharp Masking and Tone Curve settings using batch process\r\n5) Used Photoshop to apply HighPass Filter and colors, added two layers in front of the main layer as Overlay blend and set one HighPass 30 pixels and the second HighPass 4 pixels\r\n\r\nAs usual my setup is:\r\nLunt60THa with custom auto focuser and pressure tuner telescope\r\nhttps://www.cloudynights.com/topic/609170-lunt-ls60tha-diy-remote-focuser-and-pressure-tuner/\r\nTelevue 5x barlow\r\nZWO ASI174MM Camera\r\niOptron CEM25P Mount\r\n\r\nI ended capturing 134 videos (from 11:56am till 2:04pm) 2000 frames each with 45sec delay in between, later I stacked best 10% in AS3 and the final time-lapse is playing at 15FPS",
