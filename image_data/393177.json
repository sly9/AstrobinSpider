    "description": "Thor's helmet, 36 hours of SHO data with ZWO 7nm filters, ASI1600MM Pro, Esprit 120 mounted on the CEM60 using Starkeeper.it's Voyager software, which I highly recommend for unattended (or attended!) imaging.  I never lost a frame due to Voyager in 2 months of acquiring data for this object.\r\n\r\nI think this is a cool looking target, but it is pretty low in my sky - and only visible for a couple of hours a night when it pops into view between two banks of trees.  \r\n\r\nI decided to just collect data any night I was imaging and after a couple of months I realized I had 36 hours of subs, quite a bit more than my usual 9 to 18 hours.  I thought it would be interesting to see how it helped processing.\r\n\r\nSince the object is low, it was not noise-free even with that much data, but it was relatively clean and that did help with processing quite a bit.  \r\n\r\nI used a straight Hubble blend, and tweaked the colors at the end with PhotoShop's Selective Color tool to turn the greenish tints into more of a golden hue.\r\n\r\nComments and criticism always welcome!  \r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by... \r\nRowland",
