    "description": "About 40 million light years away in Coma Berenices, lies this beauty of an edge-on spiral.  It is a commonly imaged galaxy and probably doesn't need much introduction.   \r\n\r\nI made the comment to a friend that I complain a lot about this scope, but in the end it reliably churns out good data.  This set was no exception.   It really needed minimal processing and I think its natural beauty really shines through.   \r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
