    "description": "The North America Nebula NGC7000 captured earlier this year using the QHY367 Pro C full frame one shot color 36 Megapixel CMOS camera mounted on the Takahashi 130 FSQ.  \r\nOften ignored in images of The North America Nebula is the immense patch of shadows, the dark nebula LDN 935 appearing prominently (left of center) with the Cygnus Wall (at bottom left) and The Pelican Nebula IC 5070 (at center). The dust from this dark nebula obscures the emission nebula to form the region known as The Gulf of Mexico. This detailed image surely visualizes the nature of dust and gas clouds that populate the universe.\r\nIn this Hubble Palette version (SHO) the H-Alpha is mapped to green, SII is mapped to red and OIII is mapped to the blue channel. RGB data was used for the natural star color, while the colors in this image are not the true colors, the narrowband filters used in the making of this Hubble Palette image reveal much more of the hidden gasses not visible in a broadband image, covering an area over 3 x 2 degrees of sky.\r\n \r\nCaptured over 5 nights in May and June 2020 for a total acquisition time of 20.8 hours.   \r\n\r\nTechnical Details \r\nCaptured and processed by: Terry Hancock \r\nLocation: GrandMesaObservatory.com Purdy Mesa, Colorado \r\nDates of Capture May 21, 29, June 10, 12, 15 2020\r\nRGB 290 min 29 x 600 sec \r\nHA 495 min 33 x 900 sec  \r\nOIII 210 min 14 x 900  sec \r\nSII 255 min 17 x 900 sec  \r\nNarrowband Filters by  Chroma (5nm)\r\nCamera: QHY367 ProC full frame one shot color CMOS\r\nFilter Wheel: QHYCFW3 Large \r\nGain 2850, Offset 76 \r\nCalibrated with dark, Bias and Flat Frames \r\nOptics: Walter Holloway's Takahashi FSQ 130 APO Refractor @ F5 \r\nImage Scale: 1.56 arcsec/pix \r\nField of View: 3d 7' 41.0\" x 2d 3' 5.3 (127.3 x 190.1 arcmin) \r\nEQ Mount: Paramount ME  \r\nImage Acquisition software Maxim DL6 Pre Processing in Pixinsight Post Processed in Photoshop CC and Starnet.",
