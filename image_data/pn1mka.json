    "description": "This is our first light image using the new QHY600 60 Megapixel Full Frame Monochrome CMOS camera mounted on the Takahashi 130 FSQ, I want to thank QHYCCD for the honor to be testing this amazing new camera. The image was captured in RGB, Ha and OIII. (H-Alpha is mapped to Red channel @70% opacity, OIII is mapped to the blue channel @70% opacity and OIII is mapped to the green channel @50% opacity) Coming soon will be a Hubble Palette version of this capture. The Optolong OIII filter produces halos on the bright stars in this image such as 52 Cygni which is a bit disappointing however I'll be using Chroma Narrowband Filters on this setup from the end of this month.\r\n\r\nPictured here to the left of the image covering an area over 3 x 2 degrees of sky of are the Eastern Veil Nebula NGC6992 to the Western Veil Nebula NGC6960 (Witch’s Broom) far right with “Pickering’s Triangle” in between at the top of the image as well as “The Funnel” just below and the many knot’s and strands visible here and within this beautiful Supernova remnant known as the Cygnus Loop.  \r\n\r\nThis new setup is available immediately for people wanting to subscribe to Grand Mesa Observatory's system 1.  \r\n \r\nCaptured over 5 nights in July and August for a total acquisition time of 8.5 hours.\r\n \r\nTechnical Details\r\nCaptured and processed by: Terry Hancock\r\nLocation: GrandMesaObservatory.com Purdy Mesa, Colorado \r\nDates of Capture July 30, August 6th, 8th, 11th and 13th 2020 \r\nHA 210 min 21 x 600 sec \r\nOIII 140 min 14 x 600  sec \r\nRGB  165 min 11 x 300  sec (per channel) \r\nNarrowband Filters by Optolong\r\nCamera: QHY600 Monochrome CMOS Photographic version\r\nCamera Details and Specs https://www.qhyccd.com/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=94&id=55\r\nGain 60, Offset 76 in Read Mode Photographic 16 bit\r\nCalibrated with dark, Bias and Flat Frames\r\nOptics: Walter Holloway's Takahashi FSQ 130 APO Refractor @ F5\r\nImage Scale: 1.19 arcsec/pix\r\nField of View: 3d 7' 41.0\" x 2d 3' 5.3 (127.3 x 190.1 arcmin)\r\nEQ Mount: Paramount ME \r\nImage Acquisition software Maxim DL6 Pre Processing in Pixinsight Post Processed in Photoshop CC",
