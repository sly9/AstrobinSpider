    "description": "I took this image for two summers, looking only for the best evenings. The possibility of being an itinerant astrophotography allowed me to look for the best skies according to the weather conditions.\r\nEverything was powered by a common 1Kw generator\r\nChallenging but absolutely exciting work. Recommended for those who have patience and above all determination!",
