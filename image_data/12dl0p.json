It is one of the most active star nurseries producing massive stars in the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nLocated toward the constellation Scorpio, about 5,500 light years away and an estimated 50 light years in length.\r\n\r\nThe big bright cloud has earned the nickname cat paw because it looks like a gigantic cat footprint because of the three bubbles in the image that resemble the pads of its paws.\r\n\r\n\r\nEquipments :\r\n\r\nApo Triplet 150mm\r\nQhy 16200mm\r\n53 x 500 ‚Äù- SHO (approximately 8 hours of captures taken)\r\nSao Carlos - SP - Brazil\r\nDuring the month of june - 2019\r\n\r\nProcessing and Capture:\r\nSoftware: PixInsight, Adobe Photoshop, APT, PHD, Polemaster, Sharcap\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright: Fernando Oliveira de Menezes\r\nEmail: Barretosmed@hotmail.com",
