Feels soooo good to finally say that I finished it. Struggled for few weeks with processing, was really hard to find color mix that I like and then keep it after applying Lum. Couple of notes to self regarding OIII and SII- as this is second image that I did fully in SHO, I see that combining OIII and SII with Ha reduces detail, not increases. I don't know if this is for everyone or for every image, but it's kind of dissapointing after invesing so many hours into SII and OIII, seems that I could have gotten away with half the integration for them and could have finished other two targets in that time. Oh well, lesson learned. Going to have to test process to see if I need more integration or I'm good next time.",
