    "description": "I've had PuWe 1 on my list since I first found out about it in February and it's been at the top of my list ever since. I knew it was faint, so HFG1/Abell6 served as a kind of practice run for this. But I was not prepared. This was excruciatingly difficult. Ha was only barely visible on 400 second subframes and OIII was only visible in stacks. Even now, I still don't think I got enough OIII signal, but I think the only way to improve on that would be darker skies or 3 nm filters, neither of which I have at the moment. Part of me wants to say \"never again\". The other part of me is thinking 'maybe if I had a really sensitive CCD, a Tak Epsilon, Hyperstar or RASA and a second mount...' (so I guess that does mean 'never again?'). This image marks the first time I've done anything with PixInisght, however, it was only noise reduction. It's still terribly noisy, though, but man is PixInsight difficult! At any rate, I guess this means I'm in the process of learning how to use PI now, so expect more revisions, especially since it's a lot noisier than I was hoping it would turn out. However, I'm still not sure I can extract anything else out of this. The OIII in particular was ridiculously weak.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Horst Ziegler, Frank Iwaszkiewicz and Bob Andrews who all gave me some invaluable pointers on this as well as J-P Metsavainio for sharing his tone mapping process, which made this possible. It never would have been published without it - tone mapping enabled me to really overstretch the OIII.",
