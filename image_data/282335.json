    "description": "My first attempt at a two panel Mosaic with the SV70T.\r\nI chose Eta Carina as it's a nice big, bright target to attempt as a test over two nights.\r\n2 hrs each of 15 min subs Ha O3 & S2, 3nm Astrodon filters, with RGB stars.\r\nThere is a register problem with the stars at 9 o'clock, not sure exactly what happened there yet!\r\nI've done a basic DDP stretch on the stacks, and aligned them using MSICE, which I found to be better than photomerge in PS2017. But obviously, there's still some issues to resolve.\r\nHappy to take direction and input on this, but I don't use pixinsight, and prefer mac based solutions. That being said, I used Bootcamp to generate the stitches in MSICE for this one.\r\nThen the usual HST, Bob Franke colour palatte, Andyfied with NIK filters etc.\r\nI'm not 100% happy with the framing on this yet, IMO it needs rotatng about 30-45 degrees, so I'll likely redo it and try to get it looking really nice, so be kind with your comments folks!\r\nTaken from suburban Melbourne, Australia, Pop 4.5million people with an excessive light fetish.",
