    "description": "First image captured with the new dual rig configuration.\r\nMore than 56 hours of integration time. (Usually I am integrating 25 hours.. now dual rig :D is working ).\r\n\r\nNGC 7635, also known as the Bubble Nebula, Sharpless 162, or Caldwell 11, is an H II region emission nebula in the constellation Cassiopeia. It lies close to the direction of the open cluster Messier 52. The \"bubble\" is created by the stellar wind from a massive hot, 8.7 magnitude young central star, SAO 20575. \r\nThe nebula is near a giant molecular cloud which contains the expansion of the bubble nebula while itself being excited by the hot central star, causing it to glow.
