    "description": "The famous Crater Plato (101kms diameter). At this moon age 8d 20h, the crater has just emerged from the terminator and is lit at quite a low angle by the Sun. The shadows of the tall peaks of its rim, which are up to 2 kms high, fall on the flat, dark coloured expanse of the lava flooded interior, which is only interrupted by a few small craters.\r\nIn this south up image Mare Imbrium stretches up to the south, whilst a portion of Mare Frigoris to the north can be seen in the lower left corner of the image. Plato is set at the western extremity of the Montes Alpes, which can be seen arching up to the left, where a portion of the slash like feature, Vallis Alpes can be seen. In the mountain range to the east of Plato there is good detail of the rille system, Rimae Plato.\r\nTo the south west (up & right) in the Mare Imbrium are the classic series of lumps collectively called Montes Teneriffe. The larger central one further south is Pico and Pico beta above that.\r\nThis image is a colour image, which I will generally try to do if the seeing allows. Interestingly the Red image was significantly better than the NIR image and so I didn't use the latter image as Luminance. Instead the Red image was also used for Luminance and definitely enhanced the final result.",
