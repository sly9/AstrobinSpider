    "description": "The prominent ridge of emission in the lower left of this image is designated IC 5067, part of the well-known, larger emission nebula popularly called the Pelican Nebula (IC 5070). The ridge is about 10 light years long and forms the head and neck of the Pelican. Among the many remarkable features of this ridge are the twin jets protruding from the tip of the long, dark tendril-like pillar in the lower center of the image. These jets are considered telltale signs of an embedded protostar cataloged as Herbig-Haro 555.\r\n\r\nGathering the data for this image was a bit of a dance over a two month stretch, a few hours at a time during brief periods of clear weather and no smoke from the California wildfires. In total I gathered nearly 40 hours of data, but the sky quality was so erratic, only about 23 hours of good quality sub lights were salvageable. This is an SHO rendition with standard Hubble color assignments. In my processing approach, I attempted to reveal the details of the gas gradients, which resulted in an image with a broad range of color values. To approximate natural star color, I created another version of this image using Steve Milneâ€™s natural narrowband PI pixel math formula. I used the stars from that version and combined them with a starless version of this image.",
