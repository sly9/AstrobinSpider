    "description": "I had the impression that the M33 is a tough subject to process. And indeed it is. The original plan was to capture the M33 with the IFN. That was tough. Actually, I started to see the faint IFN starting to show up but lost the patience. I wish I acquired more Ha data. More or less the H-II regions are not pronounced enough. There is always next time!\r\n\r\nThis image is a central tight crop from the TOA-130NS FOV with the ASI6200mm-Pro. The idea for the processing is to show the spiral arms of the galaxy (made of tiny stars!) and the dust lane around the core. I didn't try to really stretch the color and push the contrast. Just want to give it a more \"gentle\" look & feel. \r\n\r\nGalaxy season is coming!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/search/?q=TeamNoctuaDSNM&subject=&telescope=&camera=&date_published_min=2011-11-09&date_published_max=2099-05-10\"><I>#TeamNoctuaDSNM</I></a>",
