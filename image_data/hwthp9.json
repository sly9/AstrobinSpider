    "description": "<b>Notes on image acquisition:</b> The subs were taken at two different observation sites in the Alps in August and September 2020 with a single-shot color CMOS camera. No filter was needed. I had to reject some subs due to bad seeing conditions. The total exposure time of the remaining images adds up to only 2.1 hours.\r\n\r\n<b>Processing steps:</b> File selection and bias/dark/flat calibration, star alignment and image integration, background flattening, photometric color calibration, noise reduction, deconvolution, non-linearization, star-background separation, local contrast enhancement, color enhancement, star size reduction, re-adding of the stars.\r\n\r\n<b>Notes on image processing:</b> Some of the brightest stars had extensive halos which required reduction.",
