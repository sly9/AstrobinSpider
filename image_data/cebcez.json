    "description": "How big is Andromeda really?\r\nThe Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31), at 2.5 million light-years (770 kiloparsecs) is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. For this reason, excluding the satellites of the Milky Way, it is the galaxy with the largest apparent size. But how big is it really?\r\nLimited to the galactic disk, as much as 12 full moons, as I reported. However, if we also consider the faintest regions that can be recorded in very deep images, the extension is not less than 25 full moons, without considering the complex of tidal structures.\r\nIn this special elaboration, the field stars were removed, using a script of my invention, and the signal of the peripheral regions was increased. As we can see the environment external to the galactic disk (shown in superimposition to the inverted image), manifests a rather unsuspected scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\nA \"normal\" version, so to speak, is here:\r\nhttps://astrob.in/zq18g6/0/",
