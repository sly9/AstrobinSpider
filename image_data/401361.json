    "description": "Data acquisition: Hubble Legacy Archive, NASA\r\nData processing: Rudy Pohl\r\nRGB image\r\nFilters used: f435w - blue, f555w - green, f625 - red\r\n\r\nThe Sombrero Galaxy, also known as  M104, is another iconic Hubble telescope image. Astronomers named it Sombrero because it resembles the well-known wide-brimmed Mexican hat with a tall bulge at the center. The galaxy is 50,000 light-years wide and is roughly 29 million light-years away, close enough to  be spotted with amateur telescopes. Researchers have found evidence of a super-massive black hole at the center of the Sombrero Galaxy. Estimated to be as large as a billion Suns, it's one of the heftiest black holes in the neighboring universe.\r\n\r\nCOOL: Check out the two interacting spiral galaxies  near the bottom of the image to the left of the blue star with the diffraction spikes.",
