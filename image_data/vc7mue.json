    "description": "Within the emission nebula IC 1396, which stretches for hundreds of light years, bright clouds and dark dust clouds interweave, and stars constantly emerge from this nebula only 3000 light-years away. This brilliant nebular image is composed of several digital images taken through narrow band filters. These filters actually block most of the starlight, and only the light waves emitted by certain kinds of atoms in the nebula can pass through, so that we can distinguish which elements are the main sources of IC 1396 glow. For example, red is the radiation from sulfur atoms, hydrogen is green, and oxygen is blue. This kind of beautiful and scientific image is very different from what we see with the naked eye. IC 1396 in the constellation Cepheus.",
