    "description": "Just realized I never uploaded this image of the Diamond Ring at C2. One of my favorites from my experience of the 2017 Total Solar Eclipse from Nashville, TN. The clouds actually added something interesting to the photo I think. They started clearing right after this, and were completely gone by max. eclipse. Still had an EXCELLENT show, and captured great photos of bailey's beads at C3.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
