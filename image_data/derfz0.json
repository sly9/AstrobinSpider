    "description": "Cederblad 214 in Cepheus\r\n\r\nI find this object to be quite arresting. I think I've seen it referred to as the Devil's Head Nebula - there certainly is something vaguely ominous  in its aspect. \r\n\r\nAround 13 hours of integration so far - some of it quality dark site data, some from my front porch. The H-alpha channel looks pretty good, but I think the O3 & S2 channels could definitely use quite a bit more time.",
