    "description": "Ongoing galaxy season 2021 with M63 and many lovely background galaxies and one tiny, special object - southwest of M63 you can see those two big stars and there I found that \"blue dot\". Not a hot or cold pixel as I could find it on the chart of www.sky-map.org  too - as shown in my screen-capture here (so that's NOT a cropped part of my image taken) but not much of an info there, could it be a quasar or is it just a distant star?\r\n:-)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/2rqc9m/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/2rqc9m/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
