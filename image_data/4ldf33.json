    "description": "It is one of the most well-known lunar formations but still attractive to the amateur astronomer.  \r\nIt is also one of the largest closed plains with polygonal contours (225 km).\r\nIts enclosure is heavily dismantled and eroded. \r\nIts elevation above the surrounding terrain and almost zero.\r\n\r\nClavius is interesting to image one to two days after the first quarter in order to enjoy lighting that allows to better appreciate all the many craters present in this magnificent arena.",
