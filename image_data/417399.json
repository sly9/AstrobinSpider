    "description": "One of the easiest targets I have processed, the image just seemed to come together without any major issues. I spend more time to try different contrast options than actually processing the image. And at the end trying to find a pleasing level for a subtle noise reduction. Here is what I did after the masters were created;\r\n\r\n- DynamicCrop \r\n- DBE (not sure if this was even needed but I did just in case)\r\n- Deconvolution\r\n- LinearFit\r\n- ChannelCombination\r\n- SNRC\r\n- A couple of curves adjustments to adjust brightness and contrast\r\n- A few different color masks to balance & saturate them separately\r\n- MorfologicalTransformation to tone down a bit the star sizes\r\n- And finally a very modest (level -7 edge protection) TGVDenoise tor chrominance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n- Mikko",
