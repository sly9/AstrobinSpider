    "description": "This is a Bi Colour of NGC, with some fairly hefty artistic freedoms taken.\r\n\r\nThe HA was taken with the RC8 and ASI1600mm, and colour data (HA, OIII) was taken with a Skywatcher Esprit 80ed and ASI183mc with Optolong Extreme (Piggy backed on RC8).\r\n\r\nThis is my second time shooting this target so wanted to do something a little more extreme regarding colour and contrast.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning toward the starless version but am in two minds. \r\n\r\nAs always any C&C are very welcome. \r\nCheers",
