    "description": "M74, the beautiful open SA galaxy in Pisces, rather big in size but with less surface brightness. Distinct arms and lots of blue star knots and pinkish HII regions. The field is full of small and distant galaxies, a few of them ring galaxies.\r\n\r\nLRGB with my 10\" f/4 workhorse, the sharpest subframes were stacked separately and mixed in to achieve best sharpness in the bright regions.",
