    "description": "Hi friends.\r\nAlthough the normal thing in my area would be to already be in short pants, we are still with the umbrella, and we have already had a month of almost uninterrupted rain, luckily I love the rain and I have a beautiful garden 😂😂😂, but photos, none 😬😬 .\r\nTime to search my hard drive and try to reprocess some data from my first configuration \"it would be\" GSO 8 \"RC and ASI1600mm, normally I include these reprocessed images as revisions, but in this case the difference with the 2019 version is made a different image (See review), the main thing was to eliminate the large halo and the microlens effect on the 58 Cyg star, which practically ruined the image and limited the processing possibilities, for that I did something improvised that helped a lot to clean the image, he explained to me, On many occasions I see in my data that the stars leave traces on their profile, which are very evident, for example in the eliminations of stars, these marks are only in the residual layer, therefore isolate it and work with it in Affinity, With the \"restoration\" tool I was able to remove all these marks and add the rest of the layers, the profile of the stars is now better defined for my eyes, and I was able to almost eliminate the huge halo.\r\nFrom there the work was more fun, I hope you like it, or not, tell me anyway 😜.\r\nGreetings friends, enjoy the sky, I will do it with the next storm 😂😂😂.\r\n\r\nÍñigo Gamarra CS.",
