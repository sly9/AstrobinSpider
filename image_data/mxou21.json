    "description": "M94 has got to be one of the more unusual\tgalaxies having both an inner ring and an outer ring. It is also particularly challenging to image due to the faint outer ring. I love the detail in the inner star forming region. The outer ring is a more complex structure than what I was able to capture being composed of several spiral arms. Next time I attempt this target, I will try to get more detail from the outer ring.",
