    "description": "Normally I do not often publish these starless versions of my images. But during the processing of narrowband data it's one of my standard steps to remove all stars and in this case I was really fascinated about all these great looking structures in the resulting image. \r\n\r\nSo I decided to go the whole way and process also this version to its end. In revision B I added the stars again. Enjoy a look to the starless heart of Flaming Star Nebula! :-)",
