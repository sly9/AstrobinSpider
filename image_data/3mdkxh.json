    "description": "I added on from a year ago trying to pull out more detail along with better processing skills.\r\n\r\nNGC 1491 (also designated Sharpless SH2-206) is a bright emission nebula and HII region, located on the edge of a vast cloud region of neutral gas, about 10,700 light-years away in the Perseus arm of our Milky Way galaxy. The stellar wind from the O5V 11.2 magnitude star (BD +50 886) at its centre is forming a blister in the gas clouds immediately surrounding it while also eroding the gas clouds.",
