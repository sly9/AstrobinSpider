    "description": "Widefield single frame (not mosaic) of Orion nebula and Horsehead nebula with WO Redcat 51 and QHY 268.  I love the amount of sky that I can cover with this combination.  Some pretty significant ring/halo artifacts that I assume are coming from reflections from the filter, but otherwise pleased with this image......\r\n\r\nFrom My IG/FB for my  largely non-astronomy friends:\r\nOpen Wide!\r\nThis is wide field view of the Orion Nebula (M42) and Horsehead Nebula which I have shot and presented individually before (and there is also the Flame nebula and Running man nebula as well!)  This is a nice widefield shot showing how relatively close these two famous structures are in the sky in the constellation Orion.\r\n\r\nOrion, the constellation, is an important constellation in almost any civilization that recorded their thoughts.  To name but a few: The Heavenly Shepherd in Babylonia, Sah in ancient Egypt, Shen in China where it literally means three for the stars of the belt, and from the Chippewa tribe “The Winter Maker” for its appearance in the winter sky.  Mentioned in the Bible three times, JRR Tolkien has a “Swordsman of the Sky”, and even in the movie Bladrunner.  So several thousand years worth of being fascinated by this constellation and its nebula....  enjoy!\r\n61x180sec, WO Redcat51, QHY268C",
