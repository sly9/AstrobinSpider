    "description": "Also known as Abell 21 and SH2-274, the Medusa Nebula is an old planetary nebula some 1500 light-years away in the constellation Gemini. This PN is shown quite rarely and the outer edge areas are so weak that these can usually not be seen at all on photos... \r\n\r\nReason enough to try it anyway! :-) An integration time of 11.25 hours only for H-alpha was then sufficient to work out the area of the halo. It looks as if a real wave movement is making its way here. There are also extremely many structures in the core area around the white dwarf star, which causes all this. Hope you like it :-)",
