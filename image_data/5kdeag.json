    "description": "While I was waiting for the subject of another project to get high enough, I thought why not use the time to shoot a little bit of M31?  I have tried this one a couple of other times and did not like the results so I was not expecting much.  Anyway, I ended up doing an hour of integration, luminance only, and was really encouraged by what I saw after bringing the image into Pixinsight.  \r\n\r\nThe resulting monochrome image, posted as the original image here, reminded me of some days long past when I was but a wee lad studying the books about astronomy my grandfather had in his library.  This is what sparked a lifetime interest for me. This image reminded me of the pictures in those old books and I believe a lot of folks here on Astrobin probably have had similar experiences.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I decided to make this a project in and of itself and subsequently acquired a lot more data to see what I could accomplish.  \r\n\r\nA couple of aesthetic notes, I purposely left the galaxy off center as there is something I really like about \"35 vAnd\" and the little string of stars to the right  of it.  I also am somewhat proud of myself for resisting the temptation to yank up on the saturation slider, lol...\r\n\r\nI'm fairly pleased with this image and I hope you like it too!\r\n\r\nCS and stay well...",
