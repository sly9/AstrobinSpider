    "description": "My image shows grand design spiral galaxy Messier 81. At first sight it seems to be a quite plane, not well detailed galaxy lacking contrast, so I decided to photograph this subject as detailed and deep as possible. For this I made luminance layer with a small pixelled monochrome camera and I reused a deeply exposed image of the same area made by a canon DSLR as color layer. Also I made a few hours of exposures in H alpha to enhance the emission regions in the galaxy's arms. As a result I've got a highly detailed and deep image of Messier 81 and some high latitude galactic cirrus in the foreground. Thanks to the deeply exposed color layer even the farthest galaxy clusters on the image are colored.\r\n\r\nScope: 200/800 SkyWatcher Newton\r\nMount: SkyWatcher NEQ6 pro upgraded\r\nGuiding: PHD2\r\nCamera: ZWO ASI183 MM Pro + Canon EOS 600D\r\nExpo: L: 12,7 óra, RGB: 20 óra, Ha: 5 óra \r\nDate: 2020.január-február\r\nLocation: Belecska, Halásztelek",
