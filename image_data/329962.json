    "description": "* Image acquisition (Halpha) by: <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/davidng/\">David Nguyen</a>.\r\n* Image acquisition (RGB) by: José Pedro Sousa. \r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n\r\nFinally, after several attempts to process this object, I managed to achieve a result (both in detail and color) that left me satisfied. I hope you enjoy and thank you for sharing your data.\r\n\r\nThe Nebula in Orion is much appreciated by astronomers. It can be seen without help of equipment like a small diffuse spot in the direction of the Orion constellation. It lies between 1500 and 1800 light-years of the Solar System and is an example of star formation, where interstellar dust forms stars as they associate due to gravitational pull.\r\n\r\nStars form when hydrogen and other elements accumulate in HII regions of space, by contraction due to their own gravity. As the gas collapses, the central cluster attracts more and more particles, transforming the gravitational potential energy into thermal energy. With the increase in temperature, the nuclear fusion process begins, giving rise to a protostar. In the HII regions, the ultraviolet light from hot stars O and B ionize the hydrogen gas around them. When the electrons recombine, they emit mainly in the visible and specifically in the wavelength 6563Å, red color.\r\n\r\nAstronomical masers are often found in this type of region and consist of interstellar gas consisting of atoms, molecules, and ions of chemical elements, or gaseous substances present in the interstellar medium, which amplify electromagnetic radiation thousands of times.\r\n\r\nAt low frequencies (up to 1 GHz), this region is opaque and emits a black body spectrum (the flow increases with frequency) to the upper limit of 10^3 Jy. The emission mechanism is Bremsstralung.\r\n\r\nAt higher frequencies (wavelengths shorter than about 30 cm), the plasma becomes transparent and the dominant emission mechanisms are the synchrotron and MASER.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n* <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/330288/\"> M42 (SHO)</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://astrob.in/330288/0/\"><img src=\"http://astrob.in/330288/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
