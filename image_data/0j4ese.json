    "description": "2-panel mosaic of M8, M20 from Negev Desert.\r\n\r\nLagoon Nebula is a giant interstellar cloud in the constellation Sagittarius. Located 5,200 light-years from Earth, M8 is home to its own star cluster: NGC 6530. The massive stars embedded within the nebula give off enormous amounts of ultraviolet radiation, ionizing the gas and causing it to shine. The nebula contains a number of Bok globules (dark, collapsing clouds of protostellar material). \r\n\r\nThe Trifid Nebula (Messier 20) is also an H II region. Its name means 'divided into three lobes'. The object is an unusual combination of an open cluster of stars: an emission nebula (the lower, red portion), a reflection nebula (the upper, blue portion) and a dark nebula.\r\n\r\nThe whole field is located near center of our galaxy and contains vast star fields populated by mostly yellow and old stars.\r\n\r\nFor this image I've decided to skip star reduction step, as vast star fields add to the composition and are the stuff from which Milky Way got its ancient name. Collecting more photons could be still helpful, especially for the reflection nebula and dust in M20, but since this field is populated by very bright objects, having 1.5 hours per panel gave me this result.\r\n\r\nText sources:\r\n[1] Wikipedia\r\n[2] https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-8-the-lagoon-nebula",
