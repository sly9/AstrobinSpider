    "description": "My interpretation of NGC2070 the Tarantula Nebula\r\n\r\nAn interesting piece of trivia I came across:  \r\n\r\nIf the Tarantula Nebula region was in our galaxy and as close to us as the Orion Nebula (the nearest stellar nursery to us), it would have the area of 60 full moons in our sky and its glow would cast shadows on the ground.\r\n\r\nfrom:  https://www.noao.edu/news/2011/pr1102.php",
