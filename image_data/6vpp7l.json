    "description": "This one has been a real struggle... I've been imaging this since June and still only managed a total of 18.8hrs. Everything that could go wrong seemed to happen with this target; even when I got good data on other targets on the same night something always seemed to go wrong with this one.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm happy to have finally imaged this target, it's never worked out for me in previous years, the most I ever got was a few subs.\r\n\r\nPS: You can find me on instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lee.borsboom.space/\">here</a>",
