    "description": "The Leo Triplet, also called the M66 Group, is a small group of spiral galaxies located in the Leo constellation at approximately 35 million light-years. It's composed of three major spiral galaxies: M65, M66 and NGC 3628 (Hamburger Galaxy). NGC 3628 has a 300,000 light-year long tidal tail. This amazing stream of stars has been drawn out of the galaxy by gravitational tides during past interactions with neighbouring galaxies. \r\n\r\nThis image has been possible thanks to the Prades (Tarragona) dark sky. The NGC 3628's tidal tail is a faint structure that needs quite deep integration times to show up some detail.\r\n\r\nThis image is the first light of my new ASI294MM Pro. \r\n\r\nImage details:\r\n\r\nLuminance: 250x120\"\r\nRGB: 40x120\" \r\nAll images at 120 Gain -15ÂºC bin2\r\nCalibrated with 50 flats, 50 darks and 50 bias\r\n\r\nTotal exposure: 12h20'\r\nImage resolution: 2.12\"/pixel\r\nAverage darkness: 21 mag/arcsec2\r\n\r\nEquipment:\r\n\r\nFSQ85ED telescope\r\nMesu200 mount\r\nASI294MM Pro camera with ZWO EFW 8 pos\r\nGuiding with ASI174MC and ZWO OAG\r\nBaader filters\r\n\r\nSoftware:\r\nSGP, PHD2, APP, PIX.\r\n\r\nAleix Roig - Prades, Catalonia, Spain.
