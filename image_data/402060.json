    "description": "At first, I believed that I had a single bright star in my frame. However further investigation revealed that there were two stars positioned in such a way that they appear as one.  The brightest (HIP41639) is blazing away at Mag 5, and the second star (GSC 7673:2997) was a little dimmer at mag 6.8.  Their combined intensities certainly added an additional challenge to processing the data with the intent to reveal dim Super-Nova Remanet details.  The frame contains a fairly small snapshot of the large Vela SNR complex.  I used SII, Ha, OIII, Lum, Red, Green, and Blue filters to capture the fairly dramatic area of sky.\r\n\r\nThe narrowband data could have been used to create a separate image.  I made a decision to attempt the more traditional RGB colour palette as I find it more appealing and pleasing to look at.  Hopefully, I didnâ€™t venture too far from the path, and the result is not too wacky looking.\r\n\r\nI do get the feeling of peering into a chamber when I look at the result.  The perfect environment for something scary to be lurking within...   Perhaps \"The Dragons Keep\".\r\n\r\nInstruments Used:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\nHa 30 X 1800     \r\nOIII 30 X 1800    \r\nSII 29 X 1800     \r\nLum 30 X 900      \r\nRed 19 X 450      \r\nGreen 20 x 450    \r\nBlue 20 X 450     \r\n\r\n59.375 Hours",
