    "description": "After five months forced break the first night with my first newton, a completely new terrain for me.\r\nI bought this fine piece used, wrong height of the secondary mirror and so on, which caused me some worries.\r\nThe instructions from Tommy Nawratil were very helpful and easy to understand, even without tools like Cheshire or Concenter.\r\nLast friday was the first chance for me to bring it under the stars for some test shots.\r\nWhen i saw the first shot on M81/M82, a loud WOW came over my lips and i gave up the idea to tune the collimation on the stars and started this series.\r\nThe stars are far from perfect (primary mirror?) and the distance from the GPU to the sensor seems to be to low.",
