    "description": "In the constellation of Cepheus and centered in this image is the Cave Nebula, situated in the large diffuse emission nebula number 155 in the Sharpless catalog, Sh2-155. In addition to emission nebulae one can see several dark nebulae, reflecting nebulae, bok globules, supernova remnants and a Herbig-Haro object called HH168. Even though the image was photographed from a dark location, the direction of the Cepheus constellation at time of shooting puts it in the sky glow from Oslo. I would have liked to get more blue exposures to be able to dig out more reflection nebulae, but weather didn't agree. Also, having just passed spring equinox, there is not much time left of the season so I decided to call quits and publish.",
