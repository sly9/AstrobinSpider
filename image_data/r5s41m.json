    "description": "While this is not as rare as some of the objects Gary Imm is imaging, I count only 25 NGC 925 images ever uploaded to Astrobin.  At 10 arc-minutes in size it's small but not truly tiny - about half the size of M110.   The galaxy covers about 450x700 of my pixels at .73\" image scale.\r\n\r\nI found a consistent gradient just below the galaxy which colored red initially.  Since the gradient was consistent across nights and filters, I suspect/suspected that it could be an Ha emission field.  But I could find no evidence of that in the few wider-field images I could find, so I removed it as a gradient.\r\n\r\nCalibration, registration and rejection in CCDStack.  HaRGB combine, color calibration, and ABE in Pixinsight.  Ha added to Luminance in Photoshop via a masked screen layer.  Sharpening via HighPass and Unsharp mask.  Noise reduction in Topaz de-noise 5.1.",
