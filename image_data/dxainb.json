    "description": "As I mentioned in my initial Astrobin post of this image, I got lucky in September with five clear nights and excellent seeing. I was able to collect more than 35 hours of data. For the images that I posted here I used only those sub lights with HFR ranging from 1.6-2.0, totaling about 24 hours of integration. With these excellent data I decided to experiment with different star processing approaches. The effort yielded seven different version of the image, designated Versions A-H. Here is a brief description of the processing approach for each version.\r\n\r\nFor me, each version has strengths and weakness, and the decision as to which to use is determined by the characteristics of the image being created. For example, Versions E and F use the same luminance-created white star field, but applied to images with very different color palettes, one with dominant cool blues, and the other dominant warm greens. For my taste, I prefer the look the white star field with version G, versus version F. My overall favorites are Versions C and D. I would like learn from you to which of these star processing approaches that you prefer, and which you do not like.\r\n\r\nVersion A – Modified Tone Mapping\r\n1. In PixInsight (PI) stack and stretch each channel, Ha, SII, OIII, R, G, and B. Convert to non-linear using Histogram Transformation.\r\n2. Remove stars from Ha, SII, and OIII masters with StarNet (stand-alone application), then LightRoom (LR) Spot Removal to clean up artifacts, and PI Multiscale Median Transform and Deconvolution (protecting with luminance and star masks) to reduce noise and enhance fine structures\r\n3. Combine R, G, and B masters (with stars) PI Pixel Math (no weightings).\r\n4. Combine Ha, SII, OIII starless masters in PI Pixel Math with Hubble Palette color assignments (no weightings).\r\n5. Use Photoshop (PS) Selective Color to color correct resulting image.\r\n6. Take resulting color-corrected image into PI and use LRGBCombine to merge with Starless Ha Master Luminance.\r\n7. In PS use LRGBCombine image as a base Layer, and RGB Master with mask as a top Layer, adjusting mask to reveal stars.\r\n8. Adjust color, contrast, and crop resulting image in LR.\r\n\r\nVersion C – NBRGB with starless NB merged with RGB, master luminance on resulting image\r\nSteps 1-3 the same as Version A\r\n4. Use PI NBRGB script to combine RGB master and starless Ha, SII, and OIII masters.\r\n5. Merge resulting NBRGB image with Ha Master Luminance (with stars) using PI LRGBCombine.\r\n6. Adjust color, contrast, and crop resulting NBRGB image in LR.\r\n\r\nVersion D - NBRGB with starless NB merged with RGB/ master luminance\r\nSteps 1 – 3 the same as Version A\r\n4. Merge resulting RGB image with Ha Master Luminance (with stars) using PI LRGBCombine.\r\n5. Use PI NBRGB script to combine RGB/Lum and starless Ha, SII, OIII masters.\r\n6. Adjust color, contrast, and crop resulting NBRGB image in LR.\r\n\r\nVersion E – NBRGB with starless NB and RGB (no master luminance)\r\nSteps 1-3 the same as Version A\r\n4. Use PI NBRGB script to combine RGB master and starless Ha, SII, OIII masters.\r\n5. Adjust color, contrast, and crop resulting NBRGB in LR.\r\n\r\nVersion F – Pixel Math with starless NB, master luminance on resulting image, palette 1\r\nSteps 1. and 2. same as Version A.\r\n3. Combine Ha, SII, OIII starless masters in PI Pixel Math with Hubble Palette color assignments (no weightings).\r\n4. Use Photoshop (PS) Selective Color to color correct resulting image.\r\n5. Apply master luminance mask using PI LRGB Combine\r\n6. Adjust colors, contrast, and crop resulting image in LR.\r\n\r\nVersion G – Pixel Math with starless NB, master luminance on resulting image, palette 2\r\nSame steps as Version E\r\n\r\nVersion H – Pixel Math with star NB, master luminance on resulting image\r\n1. In PixInsight (PI) stack and stretch each channel, Ha, SII, and OIII. Convert to non-linear using Histogram Transformation.\r\n2. Combine Ha, SII, OIII masters with stars in PI Pixel Math with Hubble Palette color assignments (no weightings).\r\n3. Use Photoshop (PS) Selective Color to color correct resulting image.\r\n4. Apply master luminance mask using PI LRGB Combine\r\n5. Adjust colors, contrast, and crop resulting image in LR.",
