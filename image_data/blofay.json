    "description": "This is LRGB data from Telescope Live at the El Sauce hosting facility at 1500m elevation in Río Hurtado, Coquimbo Region, Chile. RGB data is 3 x 10 min for each channel. Lum is 6 x 10 min (no binning). 61 cm aperture clearly helps to keep S/N high even after a rather short integration time.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia: Centaurus A (also known as NGC 5128 or Caldwell 77) is a galaxy in the constellation of Centaurus. It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop from his home in Parramatta, in New South Wales, Australia. There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the galaxy's fundamental properties such as its Hubble type (lenticular galaxy or a giant elliptical galaxy) and distance (10–16 million light-years). It is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth, so its active galactic nucleus has been extensively studied. The galaxy is also the fifth-brightest in the sky, but it is only visible from the southern hemisphere and low northern latitudes. The center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of 55 million solar masses, which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. Models have suggested that Centaurus A was a large elliptical galaxy that collided with a smaller spiral galaxy, with which it will eventually merge.",
