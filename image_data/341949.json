    "description": "I love galaxy season so much, this triplet is no different. Was definitely blown away with not only the amount of detail found within these galaxies, but the colors that could be extracted as well. While there was some faint IFN in the area that could have been brought out, I decided to leave it fairly close to the background levels, I thought it made the image look a bit too dirty. Maybe I'll go back and reprocess this image to make the background pop out rather than slide it into the shadows.",
