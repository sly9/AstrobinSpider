    "description": "Started late on this one and just plain ran out of time on the Ha (and what little bit of Ha there is was shot under poor seeing). The OIII, on the other hand, was shot under unusually good conditions and is some of the cleanest OIII data that I've collected. \r\n\r\nThis is another attempt at \"zoom drizzling\" and the result certainly leaves something to be desired in terms of fine detail at full res... I definitely plan to revisit this one next year and finish Ha collection/reprocess.",
