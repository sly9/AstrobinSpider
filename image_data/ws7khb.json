    "description": "M63 (NGC 5055) is a spiral galaxy in Canes Venatici and lies roughly 37 million light years from Earth.  It is nearly 100,000 light  years across and is a member of the M51 galaxy group which includes NGC 5023, NGC 5229 and UGC 8331.  With spiral arms that are patchy and discontinuous, M63 is considered a flocculent galaxy.  The faint giant arc-loop is a result of a merger with a dwarf satellite galaxy.
