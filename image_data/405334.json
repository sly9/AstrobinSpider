    "description": "Jupiter photographing session on Anzac Day morning, 25 Apr 2019 AEST.\r\n\r\nHad the longest imaging run for this year with 450+ GB recorded video - over 100 clips targeting Jupiter, Saturn and a waning gibbous Moon.  Seeing improved as the night went on, peaking around 5 am local time.  Some of the latter stacks show clarity I have not yet experienced with my setup, pointing at exceptional conditions early that morning.\r\n\r\nAnimation combines single 700 frame stacks 80 seconds each - it demonstrates highly variable nature of planetary imaging.  Due to alt az fork mount / imaging train I am prevented from capturing planets over 74 degrees in altitude so there's a break here around meridian crossing.",
