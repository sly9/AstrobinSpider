    "description": "The Ha emission region SH2-129, commonly called the Flying Bat Nebula, contains the Squid Nebula, designated Ou4, a mysterious, squid-like apparition.  This nebula is very faint Oiii emission, but also very large in planet Earth's sky.  It spans some 2 full moons toward the constellation Cepheus.  This image presents the Squid in its true teal colors, a mixture of green and blue.\r\n\r\nOu4 was recently discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the remarkable nebula's bipolar shape and emission are consistent with it being a planetary nebula, the gaseous shroud of a dying sun-like star, but its actual distance and origin are unknown. A new investigation suggests Ou4 really lies within the Ha emission region SH2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. \r\n\r\nConsistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be nearly 50 light-years across.\r\n\r\nMy Collections:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2627/\" target=\"_new\">Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2626/\" target=\"_new\">Galaxies</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2625/\" target=\"_new\">Sharpless 2 Objects</a>",
