    "description": "Continuing on from the same session as <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/flbi9v/\" target=\"_blank\">my last Jupiter image</a> ... \r\n\r\nIt was nice to finally have some \"quality time\" with Saturn again - during most of my sessions this season, conditions had deteriorated too much by the time I turned the OTA in this direction (sometimes, admittedly, due to my preoccupation with Jupiter).\r\n\r\nThankfully the conditions held up this time and the clouds stayed away, allowing me to complete 10 x 180s captures. Seeing stayed pretty constant, so I was able to stack the top 10% of frames for each and then de-rotate all 10 stacks in WinJUPOS. This image is the result.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/axflbz/B/\">Rev B</a> shows an animation at 1 min intervals (16 mins total) to confirm the presence of a storm along the southern edge of the north polar region.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
