    "description": "Original version: Lum only\r\n\r\nA unique look at two galaxies presenting edge-on and face-on views.\r\n\r\nNGC 1055 + NGC 1068 form a binary galactic system. These two are the largest galaxies of a small galaxy group that also includes NGC 1073, and five other small irregular galaxies.  The separation between NGC 1055 and M77 is about 442,000 light-years.\r\n\r\nNGC 1055 is an edge-on spiral galaxy located in the constellation Cetus that has a prominent nuclear bulge crossed by a wide, knotty, dark lane of dust and gas. The spiral arm structure appears to be elevated above the galaxy's plane and obscures the upper half of the bulge. Discovered on December 19, 1783 by William Herschel from his home in Slough England.  A rough distance estimate for NGC 1055 is 52 million light-years, with a diameter of about 115,800 light-years. \r\n\r\nNGC 1068 is a barred spiral galaxy about 47 million light-years away in the constellation Cetus. NGC 1068 is an active galaxy with an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), which is obscured from view by astronomical dust at visible wavelengths. [Source: adapted from Wikipedia]",
