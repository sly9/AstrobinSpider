    "description": "Why did the running chicken cross the road... could it be he was on FIRE?\n\n12hours worth of narrowband Ha, OIII, SII taken over two nights. Stacked as separate channels in APP and then processed in Startool 1.7 using SHO proportions of 40SII+60Ha, 70Ha+30OII, 100OIII. Final tweaks in Photoshop CC.\n\nThis is a much more enjoyable subject in narrowband mono. My earlier attempts with OSC came out perversely as pretty mono-chromatic. To be able to pull such blues and orange/green tinges I think makes this a much more interesting target... and to my eyes at elast looks like it's aflame :-)",
