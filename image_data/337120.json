    "description": "The star Regulus , the heart of the Lion, and Leo I  a dwarf galaxy are within one degree of each other. Close in the sky but Regulus is located about 75 light years away and Leo 1 is located more than 10,000 times further at about 800,000 light years away. \r\n\r\nRegulus is the twenty-first brightest star in the night sky with an apparent magnitude of +1.35, a B type star with almost 4 solar masses. Regulus is part of a multiple star system, with a close companion star visible to the upper left. \r\n\r\nLeo I is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy and thought to be one of the most distant of the Local Group of galaxies. The local group is dominated by our Milky Way Galaxy and M31. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of small and distant galaxies visible here as well. This is a crop from a larger image using Astrodon RGB filters (27)R + (22)G + (20)B all at 180 seconda using an 8\" F/2.6 home made astrograph.\r\n\r\nNorth is to the left.",
