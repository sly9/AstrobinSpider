    "description": "The first clear night after almost two months. It was very cold -11Â°C, no need for cooling the camera ðŸ˜„ I was very excited to test my new dual setup with two 5\" newtons. Now I can double the exposure time, especially in summer. I had a little trouble to get them parallel, but now it works. I'm very happy with the new \"Multi Star Guiding\" in PHD2, it's much better now.",
