    "description": "M81 - Luminance only\r\n\r\nOne of the main reason for upgrading the mount was to be able to shoot at native focal length and the mount delivered well (solid 0.5 arcsec/px guiding all night). However I messed up collimation as well as spacing. so I had to crop the image. I am still pleased with the result. Once I fix the spacing, it should do well.\r\n\r\nVersion E: Got shutdown with clouds/rain. Only managed 6x480 seconds each for R/G/B.. Waaaay too less for color.. but here it is with the anemic color data. Hoping to cleaning it up with more RGB data.",
