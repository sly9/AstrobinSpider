    "description": "I took one of my high-resolution lunar photos of the Copernicus crater region and mapped it in 3D using experimental displacement data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC). \r\n\r\nThis shows the relative heights/depths of the craters and mountains in the region. For reference, Copernicus is ~93 km in diameter and ~3.8 km deep. The central uplifts (mountains in the middle are around 800 m high!  \r\n\r\nThe FOV covers a region of ~410 sq.km. \r\n\r\nLROC displacement data is freely available: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4720 \r\n\r\nI used the free 3D graphics program Blender to render the displacement model.",
