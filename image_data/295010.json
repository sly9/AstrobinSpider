    "description": "The Angel Nebula (Mandel-Wilson-2 or MW2) is part of the galactic cirrus' northern spur, a section of the giant dust cloud sitting above the plane of the milky-way. This cirrus is sometimes referred to as the \"integrated Flux Nebula\" or (IFN). Located in Ursa Major the Angel Nebula is believed to be about 300 light year above the plane of our galaxy.\r\nHigh latitude galactic cirrus were first noticed on plates of the Palomar sky survey in the '60s and subsequently discussed by B.T Lynds, A. Sandage and D. Malin among others. The extend of the nebulosity was mapped by two IR satellites in the late 90's. In 2004 it was imaged and cataloged by Steve Mandel as part of his unexplored nebulae project. This image taken in 2011 covers a ~2.5 degrees field of view and shows extensive details of the structure of the galactic cirrus. ",
