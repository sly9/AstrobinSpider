    "description": "A bit of fun on a cloudy month.  I have often wondered what the result would be if I combined an RGB dataset and SHO dataset.  Well, for the Rosette, this is the answer - a 50-50 blend.  I found myself not wholly satisfied with my RGB result, and not wholly satisfied with my HaSHO endeavor - despite uncounted processing marathons.   I think I may have stumbled on the answer, at least for me for this nebula.  For those of you who have decent RGB stars, it may reduce that aspect of the image.  My RGB stars were horrendous, so even that was an improvement.",
