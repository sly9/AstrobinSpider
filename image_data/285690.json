    "description": "NGC 3521 is a magnitude 8.9 galaxy in the constellation of Leo and is located at a distance of about 35 million light years. \r\n\r\nThis has long been one of my favorite galaxies and I am pleased with the color and detail that I have been able to capture. This guy is sometimes overlooked in favor of its neighbors M65, M66, and NGC 3628. I think it looks a lot like M63, the Sunflower galaxy, although it is seen at a different angle.\r\n\r\nDate: Mar 2008\r\nLocation: New Ringgold PA\r\nOptics: Meade LX200R 12 inch at f/10\r\nMount: Paramount ME\r\nCamera: SBIG ST-8XME / CFW-8\r\nGuiding: ST-8XME integral guiding chip controlled by Maxim CCD\r\nExposure: LRGB: Luminance: 12x6 minutes unbinned; RGB: 8 each binned 2x2 - 5 min for R,G, and 7 min for B.\r\nProcessing: Image acquisition using CCD Autopilot. Initial processing was done using Maxim DL with subsequent processing with Photoshop.",
