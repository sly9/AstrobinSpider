    "description": "Our Moon in HDR ðŸŒ™ It isn't just gray and white. There are minerals on the surface of the moon which reflect visible wavelengths. The blue areas are rich in titanium which is part of the mineral ilmenite. The brown areas are rusty iron patches, called hematite.\r\n\r\nI took this picture with my normal DSLR (Canon 77D) at 2x200mm. It amazes me every time how this camera can reveal what his hidden to my human eyes.\r\n\r\nThis image was taken on the 27th of September 2020 at around 10pm. The little star on the bottom right next to the Moon is called 37Capricorni.\r\n\r\nThis is a composite of different exposures. I took 850 pictures (ISO100, f8, 1/40) of the bright side and stacked the 200 best ones in AutoStakkert3, sharpened it in RegiStax6 using Wavelets, brought out the colors in Lightroom, blended the exposures in Affinity Photo and used green noise removal and banding reduction in Siril.",
