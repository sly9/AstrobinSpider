    "description": "* Image acquisition by: The Liverpool Telescope.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa\r\n\r\nLittle Ghost Nebula is a planetary nebula in the constellation Ophiuchus\r\n\r\nRound and planet-shaped, the nebula is also relatively faint. Planetary nebulae are not related to planets at all, but instead are created at the end of a sun-like star's life as its outer layers expand into space while the star's core shrinks to become a white dwarf. The transformed white dwarf star, seen near the center, radiates strongly at ultraviolet wavelengths and powers the expanding nebula's glow. The nebula's main ring structure is about a light-year across and the glow from ionized oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms are colored blue, green, and red respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Little Ghost Nebula should not be confused with the Ghost Nebula (Sh2-136) or the Ghost Head Nebula (NGC 2080).",
