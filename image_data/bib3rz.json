    "description": "Well, I treated myself to using some fancy data on my birthday, because I was not able to image here, because of the unexpected inclemency. Thanks to Martin Pugh in Australia for allowing people to process this spectacular data... It was 3 luminances, 3 reds, 3 greens 3 blues at 20 minutes long each, plus 3 Has at 30 minutes long each. This totals 5.5 hours imaging time. Good night everyone...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.martinpughastrophotography.space/",
