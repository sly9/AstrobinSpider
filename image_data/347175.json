    "description": "I waited for the opportunity of a good seeing for the color image after the release of the H-Alpha version: <a href=\"https://astrob.in/343586/0/\">https://astrob.in/343586/0/</a>\r\n\r\nAs an extension of the Great Carina Nebula, NGC 3324 is an open cluster located at a distance of 7560 light-years from our system. It is confused with the star forming region, as a whole, including Gum 31, an emission nebula, also called IC 2599. Together, some see a resemblance to the Chilean poetess, hence the nickname Gabriela Mistral.\r\n\r\nNGC 3293 is also an open cluster. Discovered by Abbe Lacaille in 1751-52, it has a hundred stars including blue and red giants.",
