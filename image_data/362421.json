    "description": "Sometimes we don't have to chase bright, spectacular or popular deep sky objects. Sometimes we don't have to set hard targets and don't have to stress ourself with high expectation. Sometimes we should simply enjoy the warm summer night with good comapnion. Just laying on the back facing to the Milky Way and stare in to the abyss. The scope is set towards a bright emission area with rich star field and we fall asleep by the ticking of the clockwork of the scope mount.This is what it should be all about.",
