    "description": "I had shot this moon mosaic (9 panel) using Edge11 and ASI1600 sometime ago . The colors were saturated specifically to accentuate the subtle differences in image. I was trying to see if inverted version has more details (Which works great for solar) and it looks very interesting . The impact marks are very prominent and some of the smaller craters are more easily visible.",
