    "description": "Now just barely high enough to clear the edge of the dome. Shot between 9:15 PM (19° alt) and 9:30 PM (17° alt). Then it's gone.\r\n\r\nHere the L600 mount tracks the comet's exact motion for maximum resolution during the 1 minute exposures.\r\n\r\nStar trails are then removed. A second capture is then taken the next day with the same framing. But this time the comet is out of frame and we can track on the stars and screen the two.",
