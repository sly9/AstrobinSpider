    "description": "Selecting Jellyfish as the target for my newly acquired TEC140 turned out a bit challenge. The bright star caused microlensing and reflection, exposed weakness from ASI1600. Luckily these issues could be taken care in post processing.  Other than that, I am very happy with my new toy. Stars are perfectly round, image is sharp.\r\n\r\nHa: 38x600s\r\nO3: 60x600s\r\nS2: 42x600s\r\nR/G/B: 20x60s each",
