    "description": "Messier 108 (M108, NGC 3556) is an edge-on spiral galaxy in Ursa Major situated near the bright star Beta Ursa Majoris and close to the Owl Nebula, M97, only 48' away. It has a visual magnitude 10. It is about 45 million light years away and is a member of the Ursa Major group, a rather loose collection of galaxies. \r\nThe nearly edge-on galaxy appears to have no bulge and no pronounced core at all. The dust lane, H2 regions, and star clusters provide a jumbled and chaotic appearance, but show a lot of resolved detail.  This is my second attempt at this object.  I think I have a wider field and better color but possibly not the resolution of my last attempt.\r\n\r\nDate: Jan-Mar 2019\r\nLocation: New Ringgold PA\r\nOptics: LUM: Starizona Hyperion f/8 12.5 inch, FL 2540 mm \r\nMount: LUM: Paramount ME\r\nCamera: LUM: Apogee U8300\r\nGuiding: ST-402 on Innovations Foresight On-Axis Guider\r\n\r\nOptics: RGB: Celestron EdgeHD 1100 \r\nMount: RGB: Paramount MX\r\nCamera: RGB:Sbig STL-11000\r\n\r\nExposure: LRGB (unbinned): L:69x10 R:20x10 min, G:6x10 min, B:20x10 min Total 19.2 hrs  115 subs at avg 600  sec\r\nProcessing: Image acquisition using CCD Autopilot.
