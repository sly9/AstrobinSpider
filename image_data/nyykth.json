    "description": "M78 is a beautiful reflection nebula in Orion. It is the brightest reflection nebula in the sky, according to Sky Safari. It lies 1600 ly away. NGC 2071 to its left is also a reflection nebula..It lies 550 ly. A small portion of Barnard's Loop appears in the left portion of the image, emitting its red Ha gas. In the upper right corner you can see the blue rays of light from the nearby star Alnitak, a blue super giant. It is 1 degree outside of the frame! \r\n  I had a lot of fun with a couple of my Astronomy friends collecting this data over two evenings from the dark site!",
