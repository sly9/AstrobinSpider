    "description": "Here is the second image showing the Proper Motion of stars. In this image I found 35 stars that hve moved. Again, Proper Motion is the apparent angular motion of a star across the sky with respect to more distant stars. Even within our lifetime, we can see stars change their position relative to others, from our point of view. I took the 1954 image from the POSS1 database and compared it to my image from 2018.\r\n\r\nSome of these movements are very small. Look carefully in each white box to spot the motion. You will probably have to expand to full resolution to spot them all.",
