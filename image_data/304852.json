    "description": "Part of the Cygnus Loop, which is a supernova remnant from a star that exploded sometime between 6,000-3,000 BC, it is also sometimes called the Witch's Broom.  It lies about 1,470 lightyears away.\r\n\r\nProcessing this image gave me a little bit of trouble; it was super noisy for some reason.  But I finally found a stacking mode that seemed to reduce the noise (the Auto Adaptive Weighted Average, and no background calibration).",
