    "description": "Sh2-308 Gourde Nebula (or RCW11) is a ring nebula surrounding Wolf-Rayet star WR6 in Canis Major. It is about 5,200 light years distant, and occupies 2/3 of a degree of sky, making the nebula nearly 60 light years across.\r\nWR6 ( in the centre of the nebula in this image) is one of our closest Wolf-Rayet stars, with a mass of more than 20 solar masses.  Its radiation is ionising material (mainly oxygen) previously ejected by the star.\r\nThe nebula is estimated at about 70,000 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe RCW catalog of Halpha emission regions in the Southern Milky Way was published in 1960 by Alex Rogers, Colin Campbell and John Whiteoak working at Australia's Mount Stromlo Observatory.",
