    "description": "I did the Pencil Nebula in HOORGB. I used 2x R, 2x G, 2x B, 2x Ha, and 2x Oiii, all were 300s and from telescope.live\r\n\r\nI ran them all through APP as their own channels as a full integration, then I used the RGB Combine tool and loaded R, G, B, Ha, and Oiii, and then has to load a second Oiii. R, G, and B assigned themselves red, green, and blue, and so I then assigned the Ha as 100% red, one of the Oiii channels as 100% blue, and the other Oiii channel as 100% green, which set each color channel as T 50%. \r\n\r\nI then saved that out as a 16 bit tiff and brought it into Photoshop 2021 and finished up by aligning the levels exactly as I wanted, boosting saturation and vibrance, running clarity and messing with the curves and levels a bit more, and running some noise reduction on it. I can only imagine how good it would look with 5 times the data.",
