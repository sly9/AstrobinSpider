    "description": "Resembling a Burning tree in a raging Australian bushfire, the hydrogen \"flames\" of Carina appear to burn brightly in the Southern portion of the Great Carina Nebula. Located 10.000 ly distant and nearly four times the size of the Orion Nebula, this is one of the largest HII regions of the Milky Way.\r\nFirst use of the TOA/FS reducer - I like the 1 stop speed advantage, but pixel peepers will notice a little residual tilt top right.\r\nTaken from my light polluted suburban backyard in Melbourne, Australia.\r\n12 hrs Ha/O3/S2 & an hour's RGB for the stars.\r\n\r\nMy son thinks it resembles a maple leaf, what can you see?",
