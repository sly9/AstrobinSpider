The super-cluster, NGC 2070, which you can clearly see at the center of the Tarantula Nebula (the white grouping of stars) provides most of the energy that illuminates this very large cloud. At the center of the star cluster, the condensation (tight grouping) of stars, named R136, is one of the most energetic star clusters known and contains the most massive star known: R136a1, which is 8.7 million times more luminous than our sun. The cluster’s total mass is about 450,000 solar masses, and it will likely become a globular cluster in the distant future.\r\n\r\nWith the energy of R136a1, and many other giant stars in NGC 2070, the Tarantula nebula, despite its great distance, shines at magnitude 8. If it were as close as the Great Nebula in Orion, it would cast shadows at night! (Well, if you lived in NY City, no shadows.)\r\n\r\nThe grainy background in the image (e.g., in the upper left) results from the plethora of stars in the LMC. In addition to the star cluster described above, this image captures several other clusters and nebulae. \r\n\r\n(The colors assigned to the narrowband images correspond to their actual RGB colors. The image was photometrically color calibrated. However some adjustments to the nebulae displace there colors a moderate amount from their calibration colors.)",
