    "description": "The object Dr14 (Drechsler 14, PN-G 233.7-00.4), nicknamed \"Rose Bud nebula\", is an old, developed planetary nebula that has already interacted with the interstellar medium. This explains its elongated shape. \r\nPN-G 233.7-00.4 is located in the center of the image, east of SH 2-305.\r\nDr14 was discovered by me in February 2019 and is located in the constellation Puppis.\r\n\r\nPlease excuse the relatively poor picture quality. On the one hand PN-G 233.7-00.4 is very faint and on the other hand the telescope time at the Chilescope is not cheap ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMarcel",
