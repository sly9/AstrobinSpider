    "description": "This object is very nice but hard to process - it is very dim and plus there is no real backgroung here, it is all filled with dust.\r\n\r\nThis area looks quiet at boring at the first glance, but there is so much going on there!\r\n\r\nIt is just filled with HH objects, which is evidence of intensive star formation in this region. \r\n\r\nIn the left upper part you can see quite famous Gyulbudaghian's Nebula (no idea how to pronounce or even spell this :) ). It is illuminated by a variable star PV Cep. This nebula is known because of it's constantly changing shape and brightness (on the timescale of years and even months!). You can find some interesting images of this nebula, including comparisons of its shape at different times.\r\n\r\nIn the upper right there is another nebula, illuminated by a young stellar object (YSO), but I didn't find more information about it.",
