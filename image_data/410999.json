    "description": "This object is a remarkable emission nebula located 7000 light years away in the constellation of Serpens. The large star cluster at the heart of the Eagle contains approximately 8000 stars and is the source for the ionization of the surrounding gas clouds. The darker areas of dense gas are believed to be the sites of new star formation. Two such areas include the \"Pillars of Creation\", at the center of the image, and the \"Stellar Spire\" to the left of the pillars.\r\n\r\nThe Pillars of Creation formation was made famous in a 1995 Hubble telescope photo and has become the most recognizable Hubble image. The pillars are being eroded by the light from nearby stars that have recently formed. The small dark areas in the image are believed to be protostars (Bok globules), containing dense cosmic dust and gas from which star formation may take place. The Stellar Spire is about 10 light-years tall, with numerous gracefully sculpted cloud shapes at its head.\r\n\r\nThis narrowband image uses the Hubble color pallet, with red, green and blue colors assign to the sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen filters respectively. The narrowband star colors have been corrected using RGB data.\r\n\r\nThis is my favorite deep sky object and I love to image it each year.",
