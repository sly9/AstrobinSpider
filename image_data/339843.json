Simeis 147, also known as the Spaghetti Nebula, SNR G180.0-01.7 or Sharpless 2-240, is a supernova remnant (SNR) in the Milky Way, straddling the border between the constellations Auriga and Taurus. Discovered in 1952 at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory using a 25-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, it is difficult to observe due to its extremely low brightness.  \r\n\r\nEquipment. Rokinon 135mm f/2.8 “Ultra Wide Field” + QSI583ws +Paramount ME.  \r\n\r\nImage acquisition from Deep Sky West Remote Observatory, in New Mexico.",
