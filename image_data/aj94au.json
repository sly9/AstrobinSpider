    "description": "A 31-hour close up of the heart of the Eastern Veil. I decided to deviate from my usual workflow and to just \"wing it\", so experimented with a bunch of new things in Pixinsight including Mure denoise and narrowband photometric calibration. Noise reduction was not really required given high SNR, while narrowband PCC did a good job with the colors. Feedback much appreciated.",
