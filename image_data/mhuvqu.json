    "description": "I have imaged this wonderful object a few times, mostly widefield, and have hankered after a deep high resolution image for a couple of years and so was very pleased when Steve and I agreed to image it once again only this time with the TEC/QSI690 rig.  I have worked hard to control the stars and to extract some colour in the hot blue stars, which can sometimes be smothered with Ha addition - thanks to Steve once again for a critical eye during processing.\r\n\r\nFrom APOD, from the Cave of Eric Coles and Mel Heim: \"This skyscape features dusty Sharpless catalog emission region Sh2-155, the Cave Nebula. In the telescopic image, data taken through a narrowband filter tracks the reddish glow of ionized hydrogen atoms. About 2,400 light-years away, the scene lies along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy toward the royal northern constellation of Cepheus. Astronomical explorations of the region reveal that it has formed at the boundary of the massive Cepheus B molecular cloud and the hot, young stars of the Cepheus OB 3 association. The bright rim of ionized hydrogen gas is energized by radiation from the hot stars, dominated by the brightest star above and left of picture center. Radiation driven ionization fronts are likely triggering collapsing cores and new star formation within. Appropriately sized for a stellar nursery, the cosmic cave is over 10 light-years across.\"\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
