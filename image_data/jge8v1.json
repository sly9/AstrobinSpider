    "description": "The Dragons of Ara, located in the Southern Hemisphere constellation of Ara (<a href=https://www.wallhapp.com/48-classical-constellations>one of the classical 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy ca. 150 CE</a>) is an emission nebula formed by clouds of gas lit up by ionizing radiation from the open cluster NGC 6193.  According to <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6188>Wikipedia</a>, the dramatic shapes are “sculpted by the massive, young stars that have recently formed there – some are only a few million years old.”\r\n \r\nAt the lower right are symmetric emission nebulas NGC 6164 and NGC 6165, lit up by the hot bright star HD 148937 (actually a double star), and surrounded by a scalloped bubble of wispy gases.  These objects lie in a neighboring constellation, Norma.",
