    "description": "Why taking only one nebula and one cluster when you can take two of both.....\r\n\r\nIt's been quite a summer of hiking, biking and astrophotography... I have piled lots of rural sky data that I will be processing as easy and slow as those summer nights...\r\n\r\nFor this one, I think I had never taken so much data of a single object with the 135 mm (at f2.8), almost 7 hours across a couple of nights. I am happy with the result.... if only, so many stars! whenever I am photographing with the 135mm I always get the frame densely packed with stars and then i always run into the same dilemma \"should I take away (probably not as well as I'd like) those stars to emphasize the object or should I leave what Mother Nature, Optics and Electronics have delivered to me....\"\r\n\r\nIn this case I tried to find a sweet spot between both alternatives while keeping color and spirit of the zone of sky it is (after all it is a Milky Way area with lots of stars)... In any case I would love to find some references on processing images from the 135 mm.....\r\n\r\nVery happy to share it with you. \r\n\r\nBest skies, Guillermo",
