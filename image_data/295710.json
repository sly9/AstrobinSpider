    "description": "I finally had a dark, clear, transparent night.  For a change everything went smoothly without\r\nany problems.  I decided to image M37 because it will not be long before it is gone from the\r\nnight sky for this season.   Auriga is very low in the North Western sky by the time it gets dark\r\nenough to image.   I realize that an Open Star Cluster does not command the awe that a\r\nlarge colorful nebula like the Orion Nebula or a large galaxy like the Andromeda Galaxy does.\r\nBut I really enjoy the Open Star Clusters in an eyepiece,  binoculars, or in an image.  This is\r\nmy first attempt at imaging M37.   Please enjoy.",
