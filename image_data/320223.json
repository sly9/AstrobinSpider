    "description": "After capturing the data in fall 2016, I initially stacked and processed it with Deep Sky Stacker and Fitswork. Due to light pollution gradients and some partial image deformations caused by tilting in the optical train I was only able to use 46 of 65 lightframes. Now after six months of practicing the use of Pixinsight I turned toward the data again and was able to use 62 of 65 lightframes and get a much better contrast thanks to Dynamic Background Extraction and Distortion Correction. Somehow comforting to see that all these hours of missing the real life outside yield some improvements:-)",
