    "description": "First time imaging in over a year.  Revisiting the Tarantula Nebula, NGC2070.\r\n\r\nStandard Hubble palette, with 10% Ha added to the Red channel to boost it a touch. RGB Stars were also added.\r\n\r\nProcessing was in Pixinsight and PS.\r\n\r\nAs always any comments and critiques are most welcome. Enjoy.\r\nCheers George",
