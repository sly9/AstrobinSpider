    "description": "This is a reprocessing of this image I took back in 2017. I wish I had more data to better reveal the dust clouds, but I was quite pleased with the result, especially for its short 1h-integration. I find <a href=\"https://astrob.in/310082/0/\" target=\"_blank\">my original processing</a> was much improved, especially on overall color balance and vibrance. What do you think? Share your thoughts in the comments!\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, comments and suggestions are more than welcome in the comments section.\r\n\r\nDate: 20 July 2017\r\nLocations: MG, Brazil. Rural Skies (Bortle 3, calculated SQM ~21.5)\r\nCamera: Canon EOS 80D (not-modified) at ISO800\r\nOptics: Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8, operated at 200/3.5\r\nMount: Sky-Watcher HEQ5, tracking, guiding\r\nExposure Detail: 2-panel mosaic | 7 and 8x240s each | Total integration: 60min\r\n\r\n<i>[Original description below]</i>\r\n\r\nAcross this stunningly rich starfield, in Lupus (the Wolf) and Norma (the Square), lies some beautiful dark nebulosity. The dark clouds are really large in angular size, as it greatly fills the ~9x9º field of this 200mm 2 panel Mosaic. In the field's center, the dark nebulae Sandqvist 6, 7, 9, 10 and Sandqvist 14 [*] are the main attraction. In the edge of the left hand corner there's another dark nebula identified as Sandqvist 11 (see [*]).\r\n\r\n[*] Finding the correct catalogue names of this rarely imaged objects was quite a challenge. Plate solving in astrometry/AB does not offer dark nebula catalogues. What I found may even be incorrect. If possible, help with the correct cataloguing/naming of the nebulae would be more than appreciated - contact or comment. For this image, I used several images/references found online, especially B. Hubl website.\r\n\r\nThis is a \"first\" in many aspects of my astroimaging experience. My 1st DSO processed result from my new Canon 80D; 1st successful DSO Mosaic with calibration frames; 1st image stacked in AstroPixelProcessor, using its Mosaic engine with MBB. I'd call this image pretty nice \"1st light\" - as things normally tend to go worng when we're talking about \"1st lights\" =D",
