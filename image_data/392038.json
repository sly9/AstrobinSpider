    "description": "Creating a starless version of an image is always very challenging, as any remnants of the stars or their halos are often very easily visible. But it's worth it, because that's how the great structures show their full clarity. \r\n\r\nIn revision B I also added the version with all the stars. Try to blink between both of them to get all the fine details in the nebula. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it :-)",
