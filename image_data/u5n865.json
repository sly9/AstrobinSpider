    "description": "I have to admit, this is a tough target. And what is very unusual, the OIII channel is much more dominant than the Hα, do not think that I imaged another target where it was like that.\r\nI used 10 minute exposures for the Hα channel, still, the 5 minute exposures of the OIII was stronger. I like that OIII part, but a bit red would make it more interesting. In order to get this popping out I had to stretch a bit too far, and needed to deal with the color assignments. I have by now so many versions of it in my PI project that it takes up 15 Gigs. I believe I will take more images over the Winter to see if I can improve it, good weather needed for that though, and moonless! All those wishes ...\r\nVersion B shows why I think that it looks like a puppy skull.",
