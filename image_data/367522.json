    "description": "This magnificient object is the Cygnus Loop, a large supernova remnant about 1,500 light-years away in the constellation of Cygnus the Swan.  The Cygnus Loop, also known as the Veil Nebula Complex, includes the Eastern Veil and Bat Nebula on the left, Pickering's Triangle and NGC 6974 at the top, the Witch's Broom Nebula (Western Veil) on the right, and the Southeastern Knot at the bottom left edge of the image. The bright foreground star near the right edge of the image, 52 Cygnus, is not associated with the supernova remnant. \r\n\r\nAstronomers estimate that the supernova explosion that produced the nebula occurred between 3,000 BC and 6,000 BC.  The image covers an area of about 36 times the size of the full moon.  The spherical nature of the expanding supernova remnant is easy to see in this image, with the highest nebula visibility along the two outside edges from our line of sight, like looking at a soap bubble.   \r\n\r\nIn this narrowband image, the teal nebula areas are primarily oxygen (OIII) and the reddish areas are hydrogen (Ha).   The SII emission for this object is strong and I experimented with different palettes.  Unfortunately, the SII signal is basically just a subset of the Ha signal, so it does not add much to the image detail.  The palette for this image uses Ha for the red channel, OIII for the blue channel, and a combination of OIII and SII for the green channel.\r\n\r\nThe best that I can determine, the progenitor star of this supernova explosion has not been found.  It may have been destroyed in the explosion.",
