    "description": "This is an image captured by me,  processed by my friend, Mr. Eric Coles, in the positive B / W version but taken over and processed by me in the inverted version, starting from the point where Eric arrived here: \r\nhttps: //www.astrobin .com / sre5mc / B /? image_list_page = 3 & nc = & nce =\r\n\r\nThe line that Eric started seems very interesting, which allowed me to get an interesting  inverted version (as fun). I would say, just as interesting, using, among other things, HDR technology. Thanks, Eric, for your initial interesting processing line and I hope, you didn't mind me. Of course, the image still requires me to work on it, for a perfect finish.",
