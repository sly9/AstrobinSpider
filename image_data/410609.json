    "description": "I always wanted to capture M20, and this was one of my first targets in 2013 when I started in Astrophotography. Its interesting to see the difference between my first image and this one, a consequence of both acquisition and processing...My version of the image shows quite a lot of dust in front of the emission nebulae that Roberto Colombari skillfully brought out as part of the reflection nebula in his own version of the data (link: https://www.astrobin.com/410542/0/). I thank my friend Fernando Pinheiro Guimar√£es for calibrating the colors of the stars using spectral type data.\r\n\r\nCredits: Eduardo Oliveira\\Roberto Colombari\\Luiz Duczmal.",
