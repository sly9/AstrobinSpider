    "description": "This night the conditions were finally good again. . . .\n\nARP 269 or Holm 414 (Holmberg 414) is an interacting galaxy pair with active star formation regions. The two galaxies are connected by a tidal arm. The center of NGC4490 consists of two separate structures - presumably as a result of a collision of two smaller star clusters. The pair of galaxies is surrounded by diffuse star clouds.\nIt is believed that the two ARP galaxies were already closest to each other and are now moving apart. ARP269 was discovered on 01.14.1788 by the astronomer Wilhelm Herschel.\n[Allen Lawrence (University of Iowa astrophysicist), Wikipedia]",
