    "description": "This is a project I've been working on for some time with the Canon EOS Ra.\r\n\r\nThe final image includes 75 frames (25 x 5-minutes ISO 3200, 50 x 4-minutes ISO 3200).\r\n\r\nTotal Exposure: 5 Hours, 25 Minutes\r\n\r\nI applied a very subtle layer (25%) of my existing Crescent Nebula in HOO (with the Monochrome CCD) on top of this integration for a subtle extra punch in OIII.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it!!",
