    "description": "The Humunculus nebula is a very difficult object to be photographed by amateur astrophotographers. With a combination of very short exposures, I was able to partially solve the nebula even while photographing with a telescope with little aperture. I hope you like the result, in the coming days I will update this capture with short exposures in RGB to be able to solve the colors of this beautiful nebula.\r\nColor was added from my old capture in SHO:\r\nhttps://astrob.in/368674/0/",
