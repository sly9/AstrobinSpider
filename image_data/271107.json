    "description": "This image was obtained with a Canon 7D Mark II 20-megapixel digital camera and 300 mm f/2.8\r\nL IS II lens at f/2.8 and ISO 1600. No dark frame subtraction, no flat fields. Tracking with\r\nan Astrotrac and no guiding. Nineteen minutes total exposure (19 1-minute exposures).  The image was made in very bad seeing and I used only have the frames I took.\r\n\r\nThis is a natural color image. The high dynamic range of astrophotos must be stretched to\r\nbring out the range of details the camera recorded. But the typical image stretch process\r\nloses color for brighter subjects (e.g. stars and the brighter parts of the galaxy become\r\nwhiter as they are made brighter). This image uses a new algorithm that does not lose color\r\nduring the stretch. The new algorithm enables fainter details to be shown and with less\r\nnoise. This new free program will be available soon.\r\n\r\nMore information on the gallery page:\r\nhttp://www.clarkvision.com/galleries/gallery.NEW/web/m8+m20.rnclark.c08.12.2015.19frames-t4rs50-d-0.5x-c1s.html",
