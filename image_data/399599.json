    "description": "I originally thought this was a Supernova, but now I realize it's an impostor, but still a cool object.  The LBV (luminous blue variable) star can't be seen in my 2018 data of the Whirlpool Galaxy, but is now easily seen in my 2019 data.  This animation consists of two pictures, my Whirlpool Galaxy data from 2018 and my data from 2019.  Both pics are inverted to make it easier to see.\r\n\r\nThe star is near the center, a little up and to the right.\r\n\r\nData :\r\nOptlong L-Pro: 417x30\" (gain: 75, offset: 15) \r\nAstronomik Lum: 1,052x30\" (gain: 139, offset: 21)",
