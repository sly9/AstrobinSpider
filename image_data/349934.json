    "description": "With no astronomical darkness anymore here in Cologne I decided to use a little bit of time to add some OIII to y existing NGC 7000 data. Quite a bit of work to now get six channels together but I enjoy the result. \r\n\r\nAccidentally I had Gain still set at 300 for the OIII from a little Jupiter session before but I managed the noise by combining Lum from L, Ha and OIII all together. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!",
