    "description": "This object is a pair of tiny interacting galaxies located 180 million light years away in the constellation of Lynx.  Both galaxies are about 75,000 light years in diameter and are less than 1 minute in apparent diameter.\r\n\r\nThe yellowish galaxy is NGC 2444.  This galaxy is described as an elliptical galaxy in a paper, but it looks more like a spiral galaxy to me.  \r\n\r\nThe strangely shaped blue galaxy, NGC 2445, looks like it originally was a spiral galaxy.  The galaxy has a bright yellowish ring nucleus surrounded by five very small bright bluish regions which are roughly equally spaced around the nucleus.  The contrast between the  yellowish core and the bluish outer regions is very interesting.   I don't believe I have ever since another galaxy with this type of triangular, pyramid-like shape.  These blue regions have been described in several papers as HII regions, which are typically reddish in color.  I have seen these blue HII regions in several galaxies now.  I had previously thought that HII regions were always red.  \r\n\r\nThe pretty galaxy to the top right is PGC 21754, while the galaxy at lower left is PGC 2142306.  The tiny white galaxy towards the upper left corner is PGC 2145200.  Surrounding this galaxy is a line of 30 faint orange galaxies.  This appear to be in the form of a cluster, but I could find no designation for it.   Finally, note the bright white double star immediately below and left of Arp 143.",
