    "description": "* Image acquisition (RGB) by <a href=\" https://www.astrobin.com/users/Barry-Wilson/ \"> Barry Wilson</a>. \r\n* Image acquisition (Lum) by The Liverpool Telescope. \r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* Distance: 55 Mly.\r\n\r\nMessier 100 (also known as NGC 4321) is located within the southern part of constellation Coma Berenices at approximately 55 million light-years distant from Earth.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the brightest and largest galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, with a diameter of 110.000 light years, being an example of a grand design spiral galaxy.\r\n\r\nThis galaxy seems to be almost a perfect symmetric (with one armâ€™s exception), similar to our own Milky Way, has a brilliant core (caused by an active supermassive black hole), two prominent arms of bright blue stars well defined, several fainter arms and some dust lanes. \r\n\r\nThe blue stars in the arms means intense star formation activity that were formed recently from density perturbations caused by interactions with neighboring galaxies, NGC 4323 (on the right) and NGC 4328 (below the M100, not visible in this image). NGC 4323 is connected with M100 by a bridge of luminous matter.\r\n\r\nStudies of variable stars in M100 have played an important role in determining the age of the Universe.\r\n*",
