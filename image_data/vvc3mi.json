    "description": "Iteration on the Sharpless catalogue of faint nebulae.\r\n\r\nIt's not a common object, and here is the close up. Very faint and difficult. I am really proud of it :D\r\n \r\nSh2-170 is an emission nebula in Cassiopeia at around 7500 light years away.\r\nThe bright star at the centre of the nebula is ionising the surrounding hydrogen gas, causing the nebula to glow.\r\nThis nebula is about 2/3 the diameter of the full moon.",
