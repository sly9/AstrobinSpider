    "description": "When I searched through my old archives, I found this image that I was able to capture in the summer of 2008, almost ten years ago now when I started in this wonderful world of astrophotography. At that time I had a small 102mm Maksutov SkyWatcher opening that gave me great nights of observation and photography of planets. In 2008 I was able to capture this image of the moon appearing on the horizon from my terrace, behind a mountain located about 3km away with an urbanization at its top.\r\n\r\nUse a compact camera for projection by eyepiece, but I can not remember which was the eyepiece.\r\n\r\n  These are the exif data of the image:\r\n\r\nCamara BenQ C640 8Mp\r\nISO 100\r\nExposition: 1 / 11s\r\nDate: June, 2008\r\n\r\nSometimes you find old things, with which you get a smile ;-)",
