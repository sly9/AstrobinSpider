    "description": "* Image Acquisition by Jim Misti / Steven Mazlin.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* Distance: 28 Mly.\r\n\r\nThe Sombrero galaxy (Messier 104, NGC 4594) is a spiral with a bright nucleus surrounded by a flat disc of dark material, which is 28 million light years away, in the direction of the constellation Virgo and has a diameter of 50.000 light-years.\r\n\r\nIt is the dominant galaxy of its M104 group and its redshift reveals that it departs from us at more than 1,000 km / s.\r\n\r\nIts name derives from its appearance of profile that resembles a Mexican hat and the main characteristics are:\r\n• A supermassive black hole with 1,000 million solar masses, an estimate resulting from the high velocity of stars near the nucleus;\r\n• A galactic nucleus of reasonable size exhibiting intense brightness;\r\n• Well defined spiral arms;\r\n• A remarkable dark range of interstellar dust and gas that houses bright young stars;\r\n• A populous system of approximately 2,000 globular clusters (10x more than those in the Milky Way) and\r\n• A halo that stretches for thousands of light years.",
