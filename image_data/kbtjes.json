    "description": "The famous lunar fault Rupes Recta, in the shape of a sword, can be seen from this view.\r\n\r\nThe two main formations are the closed Purbach plain, at the top and almost in the center of the image, and at the bottom a cirque, Arzachel and its central peak.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare this image with that taken on 23/08/2019, which shows these two craters plunged into the lunar night.\r\n For comparison : https://www.astrobin.com/lg7o0b/?nc=user",
