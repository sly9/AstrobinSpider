    "description": "Mars before dawn on Sat 25 Apr 2020 AEST.\r\n\r\nMy first Mars derotation this apparition. The planet sports a modest 7 arc second disk now and it is becoming easier to discern surface markings on live capture feed. This view combines 18,000 best frames recorded over half hour between 5:28 and 5:57 am Canberra time.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out I was imaging around the same time as my fellow planetary photographers around the country - Andy Casely in Sydney, Niall MacNeill in regional New South Wales and Anthony Wesley in Queensland. It is interesting to compare this aspect of the planet from our respective vantage points. Chevron like structure covers the southern portion of Syrtis Major and there's quite a lot of dust in the Hellas basin. Tongue of Sinus Sabaeus is rising in the west. SPC appears very bright and is fringed by a magenta boundary detected by Niall in his image.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to capture subtle colour differentiation with the OSC, seeing was very good before arrival of fog at sunrise.",
