    "description": "This beautiful and delicate looking object is a spiral galaxy located only 15 million light years away in the northern constellation of Canes Venatici.  This galaxy is just over half the diameter of our Milky Way.  In the outer reaches of this galaxy, especially towards the top of the image, a faint star cloud is seen.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the Astrobin annotated image, the galaxy has three bright emission nebulae which have received their own NGC designations - NGC 4399, 4400, and 4401.\r\n\r\nThis is a visually appealing galaxy to me.  I love the lack of dust throughout the disk, as well as the chaotic nature of the disk structure and the vivid blueness of the numerous star clusters.  The lack of a bright core in this Seyfert galaxy is interesting.",
