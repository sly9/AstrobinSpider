    "description": "I have found only a few other images of IC 5201 published by amateurs: this is by far the most detailed one. IC 5201 is a barred spiral with multiple thin arms. The galaxy has many HII regions, which, of course, are centers of star formation. IC 5201 is not a member of a galaxy group and is therefore characterized as an isolated galaxy..\r\n\r\nThis is an RGB image with a synthetic luminance.\r\n\r\nTech Notes for ASA 500/3.6:\r\nASA Newtonian, 500 mm aperture, 1900mm focal length, F3.6\r\nFLI Proline 16803, 9 mm pixel, 4096 X 4096\r\nASA DDM85 equatorial mount\r\nProcessing with PixInsight, StarTools, and Affinity Photo",
