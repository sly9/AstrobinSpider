    "description": "WIP still. As I was getting things set up to start imaging again, I wanted to try and shoot this. It's been on my list for awhile now. I'd love to add a ton more data to it. But it only gets up to 30 degrees at my location and a tree blocks it for the first part of the night so it's very difficult for me to shoot from my location. But it could be years before I have enough data to call this done, so I might as well share what I have.",
