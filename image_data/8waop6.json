    "description": "Hi, \r\nAt night, looking at the stars, I always strengthen my belief that everything around me is spinning. In the spring for hundreds of thousands of years, the Milky Way pushes the winter constellations around the circle. We say goodbye to the winter Constellation of Orion and begin to swim in the stately constellation of Scorpio. To complement the whole, everything is covered with cosmic dust from our beautiful Milky Way.\r\nIn the buffer zone of the Bug River and roaring owl sounds, this is my second edition of the Milky Way this year! \r\n\r\n26.03.2020\r\nSky: 1 x 120s Sky Watcher Adventurer  Canon 6Da\r\nEarth: 1 x 120s ISO1600 Samyang 35mm f1.4 @f2.4",
