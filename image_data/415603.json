It was once thought to be the most massive star known, but is composed of at least three individual objects, each still among the most luminous and most massive stars known.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n* The Lobster and Catâ€™s Paw Nebula (wide field).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://astrob.in/379289/0/\"><img src=\"http://astrob.in/379289/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
