    "description": "Seen edge on, NGC 4945 is almost the size of our own Milky Way Galaxy. Located around 13 million light-years from Earth toward the southern constellation Centaurus, NGC 4945 is only about six times farther away than Andromeda, the nearest large spiral galaxy to the Milky Way. Though the galaxy's central region is largely hidden from view for optical telescopes, X-ray and infrared observations indicate significant high energy emission and star formation in the core of NGC 4945. Its obscured but active nucleus classifies this as a Seyfert galaxy and it is believed to have a central supermassive black hole.\r\nImaged in LRGB\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\r\nSystem Control: Voyager by Leo Orazi",
