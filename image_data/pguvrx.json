    "description": "Here we have Omega Centauri shot from my garden near Phoenix, Arizona at just below 33 degrees N latitude. \r\n\r\nI have been wanting to try to see what would happen if I gave this a go as I have looked at it through binoculars.  Omega Centauri is at 10 degrees at its highest altitude above the horizon and I have a gap between some trees that allows me a little time on both sides of the meridian.\r\n\r\nThis is only 56 frames at 20s each for a total of a little more than 18-minutes!\r\n\r\nI was quite surprised with the outcome...  not a great image but not bad either considering the extremes of both altitude and lack of integration time.\r\n\r\nHope you like it!  \r\n\r\nCS and Good Health\r\n\r\nP.S. To all my friends in the Southern Hemisphere, please excuse my trespass!  Lol...",
