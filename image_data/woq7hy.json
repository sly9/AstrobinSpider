    "description": "HDW 2 (Hartl-Dengl-Weinberger 2), also known as Sharpless 2-200 or PNG 138.1+04.1, is a quite old planetary nebula (PN) in the constellation Cassiopeia. The nebula is also called \"The Bearclaw Nebula\".\r\n\r\nThe bright part of the object has a diameter of about 6'. According to W. A. Weidmann and R. Gamen, who have examined the central stars of different PNs, the central star of HDW 2 is a binary star.\r\n\r\nInterestingly there is a larger outer halo around the brighter part of the nebula but it is very faint and needs the exposure time to capture it.",
