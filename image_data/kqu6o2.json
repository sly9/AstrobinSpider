    "description": "I had created two versions of Hubble Palette Color Map HSO and SHO, and I decided to keep and process the SHO version.\r\nI felt that the Flaming star nebula should be the storm of fire and Tadpoles should be in the hot spring (blue) pool.\r\nCollecting a lot of Ha data allowed me to stretch more details on red color and the same time to control the noise.\r\nHope you like this image.\r\nC & C are welcome.\r\nJian Yuan Peng\r\n\r\n--- Facts ----\r\nIC410 AND IC405 - THE TADPOLES AND THE FLAMING STAR\r\nThe Flaming Star Nebula (IC405, lower left), located in the constellation Auriga, is an emission and reflection nebula that is illuminated by the bright variable star AE Aurigae. IC405 spans about 5 light-years about 1500ly away.\r\n\r\nIC410 The Tadpoles Nebula (aka IC410)\r\nThis faint, dusty, emission nebula locates in the constellation Auriga about 12,000 light-years away from Earth. The Tadpoles Nebula is a region of faint nebulosity surrounding the open star cluster NGC 1893 that lies in the center of the nebula. There are two tadpole shapes in the center of the image about 10 light-years long which consist of denser, cooler gas, and dust, and it is known as the Tadpoles of IC 410.\r\n\r\nTechnical details:\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ-106EDX4 \r\nReducer: None\r\nTelescope Mount: Ioptorn CEM40EC\r\nImage Camera: ZWO ASI6200MM\r\nSoftware: PHD2, PixInsight, Lightroom 6.4, Sequence Generator Pro, Photoshop CS6, StarNet++\r\nLocation: Palo Alto, California, USA\r\n\r\nPhotometricColorCalibration data:\r\nResolution ............... 1.461 arcsec/px\r\nRotation ................. -179.786 deg\r\nObservation start time ... 2021-02-21 07:31:32 UTC\r\nObservation end time ..... 2021-04-02 06:37:20 UTC\r\nFocal distance ........... 530.89 mm\r\nPixel size ............... 3.76 um\r\nField of view ............ 3d 49' 24.2\" x 2d 32' 3.1\"\r\nImage center .............
