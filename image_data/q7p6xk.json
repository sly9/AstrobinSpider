    "description": "The Omega Nebula, also known as the Swan Nebula or M17, is a star forming cloud of gas and dust roughly 5000 light-years away.  It is located in the Sagittarius arm of our Milky Way galaxy, or one arm in toward the center from us.  \r\n\r\nI processed this image while watching the first episode of Lost in Space.  That episode featured images of other nebulae visible in the summer Milky Way including the Trifid (M20) out the space ship window, and the \"Pillars of Creation\" in the Eagle (M16) when Dr. Robinson's tether broke while he was space walking.  I looked for but did not see an image of the Omega Nebula.  California Institute of Technology was credited at the end for providing the space photos.\r\n\r\nI hope you like this image.",
