    "description": "There are many images of the Heart Nebula, but I never get tired to admire the faint and cloudy structures in the center. \r\n\r\nSince currently there are always high faint clods all the night, I focused on this bright object, since there is enough data even through the clouds. The data was gathered during 4 nights, but with almost 50% trash exposures due to too dense clouds and too little signal. \r\n\r\nAlso very surprising is, that the stars are very crispy though the reducer is 6mm too far away from the sensor, since the proper adapter is still in production. \r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy it the same as I do - Tank you!",
