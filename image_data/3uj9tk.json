    "description": "Abell31 is a very faint and very old planetary nebula in the constellation Cancer, and is about 10 light years across and about 2000 light years away. Planetary nebulae represent the final stages of stars similar in size to our Sun. As they consume the last bits of fuel in their cores, they expel their outer atmosphere into space. This one is moving rapidly toward the south and creating a faint bow shock seen on the left edge of this image.",
