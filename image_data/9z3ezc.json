    "description": "The Eagle and Swan Nebulae, which I don't normally see in the same frame.  I've never shot the Swan in narrowband, and I was really surprised how much rich variation there was in that nebula.  It may not be as famously shot as the eagle, but the pair make a striking duo in the Hubble Palette.\r\n\r\nI shot this at F3 over several nights near new moon.",
