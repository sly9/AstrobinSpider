    "description": "This is a two panel mosaic image of this fantastic region.This was on my list during past few years,But due to bad weather condition never had the chance to shoot.This month finally we found an opportunity to have a try on this region.I found my scope became out of colimation during the trip and collimating of E-180 is not possible at night , So try to overlap panels about 25% to eliminate some errors was appeared in top of lower panel of the mosaic.For best view please see the image in full resollution.I hope enjoy :)\r\nScope: Takahashi Epsilon 180ED\r\nCamera:Modded Canon EOS 5D MarkII\r\nMount:AZ-EQ6 Guided With ASI 120MM\r\nExposure:100*3min For Total 300min , 5Hours ISO1600\r\nTwo panels mosaic",
