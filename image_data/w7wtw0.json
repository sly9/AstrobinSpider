    "description": "I Made a wish. Since comet Ison disintegrated I waited for the day I could see a comet naked eye. I tried several times. Light pollution in Athens had a different opinion. I didn’t give up hope. My summer holidays was at a bortle 2 sky. It was the time that the comet made the transition from morning to evening skies. So, there it was, a star with a tail, the most exciting thing I have seen in my life. When I think of it, gives me goosebumps! So make your wish and never stop trying to fulfill it. \r\n\r\nThis shot had a lot of planning and a big help from my girlfriend. It was made with an old Jupiter 21M 200mm f4 from 1975 and my modded A7s. I had a custom white balance color profile inside my camera that I used which gave the purple tone for a dreamy like shot.\r\n\r\nExif:\r\nSony a7s, Jupiter 21m 200mm f4\r\nForeground 1x2sec iso 8000\r\nComet 1x20sec tracked with star adventurer\r\nBlend in Ps\r\n17.08.2020\r\n\r\nYou can see more poses, watch a small video with the comet above the model and read all about my process, the problems and mistakes I made about with this shot at my blog www.star-surfing.com/blog/neowise. Thanks you and Godspeed the comet Neowise!",
