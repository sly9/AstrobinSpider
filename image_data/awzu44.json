    "description": "Well ... there is no shortage of opinion on what this one actually looks like. Nevertheless, it picked up the nickname “the squid nebula” due to its resemblance to the sea creature. This nebula has an interesting story to tell.\r\n\r\nIt was only discovered in 2011 because it is extraordinarily faint. The elongated bipolar nebula was likely created by the central bright star (actually a close triple star system) which created the outflow sculpting the hydrogen and oxygen gasses in this region. The outflow gave rise to the red hydrogen pocket and the extended blue-green oxygen formation.\r\n\r\nIf you’d have asked me a year ago if an image like this was possible with a color camera, I’d have swiftly answered no. The tech has come a LONG way!\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out.",
