    "description": "This is my contribution to the growing number of super M78 images submitted recently :-).\r\n\r\nImaged over several weeks on our shared rig at e-Eye, Spain, this target holds a fascination for me and it is a splendid mixture of astrophysical delights!  We found early in the project that the subs had stellar artefacts, probably from nearby Alnitak, streaks of starlight and rays on about a third of the frame originating from the upper right.  Real world effects most likely caused by reflections off the Flip-Flat, possibly adding character to the image, but mostly distracting from the subject.  We therefore imaged an overlapping panel for the same overall integration, effectively doubling the total image time to 45 hours.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson.\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
