    "description": "Around 10 hours of exposure time, so far, across five nights late August - September, from my backyard in the city of Graham, NC.\r\n\r\nAndromeda Galaxy is a good, large, bright astrophotography subject with a lot of dynamic range from its bright core to its star clusters and wispy edges.  I'm using a 350mm focal length scope and a full frame sensor on a mirrorless Canon Ra.  Started with unguided exposures the first few nights, but went to autoguiding for more consistent results, longer exposures with tighter stars.\r\n\r\nI've been using this familiar target to work on my setup with this scope and a new mount, an iOptron CEM25-EC.  After multiple nights trying different things without guiding and talking to other astrophotographers, I decided the mount would need some autoguider correction now and then.",
