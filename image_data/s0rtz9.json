    "description": "I've always been in awe of this particular DSO....but residing in the Northern Hemisphere, I've never had a chance to image or process it.  NGC 6188, also known as The Fighting Dragons of Ara or The Great Wall of Ara, lies in the Southern constellation of Ara at a distance of approximately 4,000 light-years.  It's an emission nebula approximately 600 light-years across.  It is illuminated by the open cluster NGC 6193 which is located just above the center of the image.  The two largest stars of the cluster, HD 150136 and HD 150135, are causing the nebula to glow.   Total exposure time is 22.5 hours.\r\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\r\nTom",
