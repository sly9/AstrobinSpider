    "description": "LDN1622 is always an interesting object to me. The most interesting part for me is the Parsamian 3 (HBC515, HD288313) area. Anyhow, it looks like a fish trying pretty hard swimming toward the Orion nebula and about to cross the red river of Barnard's Loop...\r\n\r\nIt has been a year since the last Ha<I>L</I>RGB image. It's about time.\r\n\r\nOn and off I captured about 50+ hours of Ha data from the backyard (Guess I had nothing else in mind at that time. LOL). But only got 7.6 hours of RGB data from Atoka dark site. I assume the dark site data is far away from enough. But can't resist the temptation to take a peek what it would look like. Then here it is.\r\n\r\nAs expected the dark cloud is not showing up enough. I consider this is a project in progress. More data will be added in next couple of years to get the \"desired\" result.\r\n\r\nLacking RGB data indeed push the post-processing to the limit. A lot of Range Selection + PixelMath combinations used to extract every single drop of the signal. The starless version of the RGB masters look exactly like heavily pounded battle ground - all kinds of holes. :)\r\n\r\nThe synthetic luminance master was created from starless Ha master joined with the luminance data extracted from combined RGB master. Another fun process to put the pre-main-sequence star area back into the final luminance master.\r\n\r\n<I>Well that's it for now. Looking forward to the next round on this target.</I> &#128065;\r\n\r\n<B>Pre-processing of Narrowband Masters</B>\r\n\r\n– Calibration / Integration, Astro Pixel Processor\r\n– Deconvolution, PixInsight (Only for H-Alpha)\r\n– MultiscaleLinearTransform (Denoise), PixInsight\r\n- Range Selection, PixInsight\r\n- PixelMath, PixInsight\r\n– ScreenTransferFunction / HistogramTransformation, PixInsight.\r\n\r\n<B>Pre-processing of RGB Masters</B>\r\n\r\n– Calibration / Integration, Astro Pixel Processor\r\n– Dynamic Background Extraction, PixInsight\r\n– MorphologicalTransformation, PixInsight\r\n– ScreenTransferFunction / HistogramTransformation, PixInsight.\r\n\r\n<B>RGB Combination</B>\r\n\r\n– LRGBCombination, PixInsight\r\n– MorphologicalTransformation, PixInsight\r\n– ScreenTransferFunction / HistogramTransformation, PixInsight.\r\n\r\n<B>Narrowband Combination</B>\r\n\r\n– PixelMath, PixInsight\r\n– ScreenTransferFunction / HistogramTransformation, PixInsight.\r\n\r\n<B>Narrband & RGB Combination</B>\r\n\r\n– PixelMath, PixInsight\r\n- Detail adjustments, Adobe Lightroom Classic\r\n– Final Export, Photoshop</I>",
