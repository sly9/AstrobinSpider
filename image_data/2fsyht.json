    "description": "A great target, I have always been a sucker for spiral galaxies. This galactic cluster is no different given it contains the amazing NGC 1365. What an awesome face on spiral with some stunning structures both near the core and in the arms. There are also multiple spiral galaxies I love throughout the image as well. For example, the one near the upper center and the one below it about a third of the way down the image. Both show remarkable structures despite being quite small, especially at this focal length. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
