    "description": "Within a wing of the much larger Sea Gull Nebula, IC2177, lies a small reflection nebula called NGC 2327 which is near center in the image.  For some reason many references to this nebula indicate the head of the Sea Gull.  However a Simbad search reveals that NGC 2327 is this small reflection nebula embedded within a dark dusty cloud.  Around the image is the red emission of part of the wing of IC 2177.  The small, round and darker red emission nebula near the lower left is Sh 2-295 and enveloping it is the blue reflection object VdB90.  Near upper left is a small star cluster enveloped within a very faint bluish reflection called VdB92.  The image resolution is .92\"/pixel and is a LRGB+Ha composite.",
