    "description": "Carina nebula (NGC 3372), Running Chicken nebula (IC 2944), Southern Pleiades (IC 2602) and co. \r\n\r\nEta Carina is by far the brightest nebula in the night sky, it makes the Orion Nebula look so small and dim* in comparison. It covers 3° of apparent size, making 6 times the size of a full moon and 3 times of the Orion Nebula.\r\n\r\nSouthern Pleiades is one of the closest open clusters to us and 70% fainter than the Taurean Pleiades (as a total apparent magnitude). It is the third brightest open cluster following the Hyades, Pleiades, Alpha Persei and Coma.\r\n\r\nThe Running Chicken nebula also known as Lambda Centauri nebula, a very strange nebula nickname for a star forming nebulous region, and a clear evidence that astronomers are bad at poultry\r\n*: No part of Eta Carina is as intense as the Orion Trapezium cluster, but surface brightness takes the whole nebula into calculation not just the maximum nebulous brightness of a specific region. The same exposure settings on Orion Trapezium would have blown the highlights in the image.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood:\r\nA set of 60 frames each of 90s, F/2.4 , ISO800\r\nCanon 6D mod UV-IR cut\r\nSamyang 135mm F/2.0\r\nTracked by Vixen Polarie\r\nStacked, calibrated and pre-processed using PixInsight \r\nColor calibrated with Adobe Lightroom \r\nLocation: Mar Boutrous bita3 l Atacama",
