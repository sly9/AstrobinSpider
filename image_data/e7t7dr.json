    "description": "This area of the sky is so good, brightness contrast between the dust that sits between NGC7000 and the Pelican nebulae as well as the colour contrast of the wall itself set against the main body of NGC7000 itself\r\n\r\nThis is a H,H+O,O narrowband composition built using data from my colour camera using a Radian Triad Ultra Quadband. From the raw stack, the red channel is Ha and stays in red, I create a blend of the green and blue channel which is mostly O and assign that to blue in the final image. The green channel is created using 50:50 blend of the Ha red channel and the newly created blue O channel\r\nCygnus really is an imaging gold mine, hope you enjoy the view",
