    "description": "The first decent night in 2021.  IrRaced 250km home from a backcountry trip in the Hollyford Valley, to let my partner's bright 13-yr old niece (Charlotte)  take some astrophotos with my telescope. \r\n\r\nWe took quick (20 x 60sec subs) snaps of the Horsehead, Rosette and M42 in twilight.  While not up to the standard of this site, she was delighted to see the images of these objects on my iPhone as they came in - with all targets easily visible.on my iPhone.   Charlotte was keen to learn about each object; taking in stories of star birth and death, gas and dust in the galaxy and Universe more broadly.  All to the backdrop of images and visual observing using a pair of 8x40 binoculars.  \r\n\r\nWe then went on to do a deeper image of the Cone and Fox Fur, with Charlotte eager to learn how \"proper\" astroimaging - including the  processing.     By this time it was past midnight, I was simply left the telescope to \"do its thing\".  I was going to get back up at 3am to close things down and shut up the observatory, but my long day got the better of me, and I rescued a telescope pointing below the horizon around 7am. \r\n\r\nThe first result is here.  And I think it is pretty good for a first  attempt - albeit with a bit of help.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, we now have a 13-yr old girl who wants to be an astrophysicist. \r\n\r\n And that was the best - and most important - part of last night.   We are so lucky to be able to do this.",
