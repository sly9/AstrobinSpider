    "description": "You can call me crazy to image such an object near full moon, but I'm not dissapointed with it and I hope you are not, too. The weather turns bad and I don't know when there are clear skys again.;-)\r\n Sure the moon is the reason why the faint outer spiral arms aren't visible. On the RGB image I could see them (not well but they are there).\r\n\r\nThe object isn't shown often, therefore I chosed it. It was discovered by William Herschel on Dec 3, 1788. Arp 184 is about 185 million ly away and the distance gets larger at 3935 km/s. It spans about 220 thousand ly (without the faint northern arm). Obviously NGC1961 merged with a smaller galaxy in the past which caused the unusual shape and its appearence in the Arp catalogue.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the several tiny galaxys in the background...",
