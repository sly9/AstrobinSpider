    "description": "Four in a row (nights with comets).\r\n\r\nOn the nights of January 7,8, 9 and 10, 2021 Comet 156/P Russell-LINEAR was in the same field (Celestron RASA11 & ZWO asi 294 mcP) as M33.  \r\n\r\nAlthough I had to play with the framing a bit (see first night's processed image here https://astrob.in/vm5kfm/0/ ), I still managed to squeeze the objects into the same field.  I processed all four night's captures separately and used the mosaic process under StarAlignment in PixInsight to make this composite.  The full resolution image for the 4th night https://astrob.in/1bvta1/0/ shows a slight amount of activity around the nucleus and coma if you zero in on Comet Russell-LINEAR.\r\n\r\nAll four nights had decent transparency (7700 ft at June Lake California), but the seeing on January 8 (my birthday) was subpar.  \r\n\r\nI've put together a 40 second animation of all four nights of the captures, for anyone's viewing pleasure, found here on Vimeo https://vimeo.com/499823663",
