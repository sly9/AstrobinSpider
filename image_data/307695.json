    "description": "For a change tonight I had a decent sky.  It was relatively dark, clear, and transparent.   For years\r\nI've wanted to try and  image NGC 6960  but I just never got around to it.  To be honest I really\r\nfelt that it was an object outside of my method of imaging.   Most images that I liked of this\r\nobject were taken with very long exposures and appropriate filters.   Anyway I decided to try\r\nand image it tonight.   I did manage to get an image and I'm pleased with that.  It is pitiful\r\ncompared to a lot of the images I've seen of this object.   However the image I got tonight\r\ndoes give me hope that it is possible to get a decent image once I learn what to do when I\r\nimage the object and what is needed to properly process an image of the object.  With all of\r\nthat said please enjoy my first image of NGC 6960 the Witches Broom.     ",
