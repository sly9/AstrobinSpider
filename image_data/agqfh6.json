    "description": "This is a luminance revision of that nebula. Means that I only shoot new h alpha data new and managed the rest of colours with data I have already taken with my Apo last year. So much cloudy nights here in Germany that I cannot take any new data. The inner core, that I personally call \"the boiling curry soup\" reminds me strongly to the structure of the fox fur nebula, which hopefully will be one of my next targets. Even the Apo was quite nice, I think new data for luminace upgraded this pic clearly in\r\n resolution, which I like somehow.....hope you too.\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
