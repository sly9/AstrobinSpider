    "description": "I struggled to get both the fainter details to show without noise while at the same time getting the brighter parts to retain detail and sharpening.  So I ended up using a subset of the sharpest Luminance and color subs to create a sharp Synthetic Luminance.  I processed that in CCDStack with all of the color data I had which was bin 1x1.   This \"sharp\" version was sharpened in CCDStack an had a limited stretch.   Then I restacked all of the data, fuzzy subs and all, and stretched this more aggressively. \r\n\r\nMoving to Photoshop, the more stretched version received a Topaz Denoise and then the brighter parts of the sharp version were layered on the fuzzy one.  I then flattened and processed as normal.  I should add that when selecting the bright regions from the Sharp version, removed any stars with ringing artifacts from the sharpening process.  \r\n\r\nTotal dataset: 34 Luminance, 18 Red, 29 Green, 16 Blue, and 12 Ha.  All 15 minute subs.",
