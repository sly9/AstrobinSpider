    "description": "I decided to rework this image of Mars which was IOTD some time ago. It is my best Mars image and was captured very shortly before the global dust storm engulfed the planet. I have applied some learnings to the processing and also show the component red, green and blue images here. \r\nOlympus Mons is central to the image and the three Tharsis shield volcanoes are enshrouded with cloud which extends across to the equatorial region and over the Valles Marineris. This cloud is plainly seen in the Blue image. To the south, the large albedo area just north of the south polar cap is the Terra Sirenum.",
