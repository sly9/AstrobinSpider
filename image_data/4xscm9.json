    "description": "NGC 3344 The Sliced Onion Galaxy\r\n\r\nWhile nicely placed in Leo Minor, this low brightness object proved a challenge to coax out of the local light pollution skyglow. The individual subframes barely showed anything but the central core. Fortunately enough signal was captured to process an adequate image. Darker skies and a much longer integration time may be required to truly enhance the details of the outer spiral arms.",
