    "description": "The Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) is a planetary nebula around 3,000 light years away in the constellation of Draco.  It was first observed by William Herschel on 15 February 1786. \r\n\r\nThe planetary nebula gets its name from the feature  in the very centre of this image which is thought to bear a resemblance to a cat's eye.  \r\n\r\nNGC 6543 was photographed between 8 June and 4 September 2019 from an imaging rig in Spain that is privately-owned and remotely-operated by Barry Wilson and me.\r\n\r\nThis is a bicolour image consisting of data shot through Ha and OIII filters.  In addition RGB data was captured for star colour.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 21 x 1200s (bin 2)\r\nHa: 21 x 300s (bin1)\r\nOIII: 21 x 1200s (bin 2)\r\nOIII: 21 x 300s (bin 1)\r\nRed: 24 x 300s (bin 1)\r\nGreen: 24 x 300s (bin 1)\r\nBlue: 24 x 300s (bin 1)\r\n\r\nA total of 23 hours and 30 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
