    "description": "First successful try with the AT60ED. Wanted to do an easy cluster just to make sure I could get this thing tracking well on the Skyguider Pro. I did a run a few days ago without the Field flattener (I didn't have the right T ring), and not one sub was useable. Finally got the T ring and got everything set up right. Very happy with the results and excited for the potential of this small scope/mount combo.\r\n\r\n53x60\", ISO 1600",
