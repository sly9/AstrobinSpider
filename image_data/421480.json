    "description": "Imaged with my 200/800 f4 Lacerta newton from Vienna.\r\n\r\n<b>Object description</b> (compiled from below cited paper)\r\nAbout a degree to the east of the famous Lagoon Nebula (M 8), Simeis 188 comprises a complex of emission and reflection nebulae and dark clouds, and lies near a loose open cluster, Collinder 367, located within the HII region IC 4685. IC 4685 is a large diffuse nebula centred on V 3903 Sgr (HD 165921), an eclipsing binary comprising two main-sequence O stars (O7 V + O9 V).\r\n\r\nOn the southeastern edge of IC 4685, NGC 6559 is a bright-rimmed cloud, with the rim running NE–SW, and lying close to IRAS 18068–2405. Together with IC 4685, NGC 6559 is also known as Sh2-29.\r\n\r\nThe northeastern edge of Simeis 188 is dominated by two bright emission nebulae: IC 1274 (Sh2-32) in the north, illuminated by two stars, and IC 1275 (Sh2-31); these two are separated by the dark cloud B 91.\r\n\r\nThere are two more Barnard dark nebulae lying in front of IC 4685: B 302 and B 303, just NW and SE of V 3903 Sgr, respectively. They seem to be components of a long thin dust lane lying across and in front of the emission nebula.\r\n\r\nCollinder 367 is older than NGC 6530, but still fairly young, and lies at a similar distance (∼7 Myr and ∼1.2 kpc). V 3903 Sgr is much younger, with an age (2 Myr) and distance similar to NGC 6530, and may represent a later generation of star formation.\r\n\r\nAt the lowermost southern margin of the image lies the planetary nebula Minkowski M 1-41.\r\n\r\nThe designation “Simeis” comes from the catalogue of Gaze & Shajn (1955) developed at the Simeiz Observatory in Ukraine.\r\n\r\n<b>Reference: </b>\r\nTothill, N.
