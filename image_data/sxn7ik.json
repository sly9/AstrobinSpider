    "description": "First light with the 11\" version of the Celestron RASA. \r\n\r\nI recently decided to upgrade to the bigger model, because of the limited options like the super short backfocus, unablitly for tilt adjustment and the rather small image circle on the RASA 8\". With a bigger sensor in mind for the near future, it was the perfect time for a upgrade.\r\n\r\nI went with the Valentine Rose Nebula as my first target on the new system. Sh2-174 is an unusual ancient planetary nebula and also the northernmost object in the Sharpless catalogue.",
