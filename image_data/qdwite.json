    "description": "This is an R-RGB image, i.e. the red data was reused as luminance. The image comprises the best 30% of each of 5xRGB runs of 3 mins per filter. After a suggestion from Australian planetary imager Anthony Wesley, I removed the ADC from the optical train and was pleasantly surprised to see a significant improvement in image quality allowing me to obtain better focus.",
