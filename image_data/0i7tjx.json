    "description": "A panorama to share the beautiful colors of the night sky bathed in the orange glow of the airglow, the natural luminescence of the sky. This place is a real well of life in the driest area of the world.\r\nIf we consider the Milky Way as one of the branches of a gigantic \"X\", the other branch carries Mars, Saturn and Jupiter. We distinguish their luminous points on both sides of the galactic center.\r\nOn the left, a little above the horizon, the dwarf galaxy of the Small Magellanic Cloud.\r\n\r\n- Panorama of 15 images -",
