    "description": "HDW2 (Hartl-Dengl-Weinberger 2; )is a large and faint, ancient planetary nebula in Cassiopeia. It is located very close to another large faint and ancient PN HFG1.  I do not know any common name for this nebula, so I'd call it the \"Bearclaw nebula\" from its surface texture. The center part is rich in Oiii (and some Ha), and the surrounding halo in Ha. There is little Sii in this target. \r\nC8+ Hyperstar 3 with an aperture mask (stopped down to F/3). Atik 460ex mono. Astrodon 5nm filters. Exposure info is as follows:\r\nHa: 10 min x 65\r\nOiii: 10 min x 46\r\nSii: 10 min x 19\r\n\r\nGranview Campground, INYO California. Shot over 3 nights in very good seeing. Transparency was (as usual) good to above average.",
