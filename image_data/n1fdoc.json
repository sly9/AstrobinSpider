    "description": "The open cluster NGC 225, known as the sailboat, appears just above the dark nebula VDB4.   Not much is out there on these two, either photographically or descriptively.  It appears that the Cluster is in front of the nebula as the dust is reflecting the blue light of the young stars.  \r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the is significant gas surrounding the stars in the cluster as well.  The area around the stars seems to be glowing a bit and brighter than the sky background further away.  This gives the image a soft look which I retained.  Attempts to add contrast or bring up the black level obliterated the dark nebula below the cluster so I assumed this soft glow is real.\r\n\r\nI believe this to be the sharpest data I've captured to date.  Even after star alignment and the resample the median FWHM was below 2.0\"and the Luminance median around 1.8\".   Sharpness that is completely wasted on this sort of target!\r\n\r\nCCDStack for Calibration, deconvolution, and stretching.\r\nPixinsight for Cosmetic correction, DBE, Star Alignment, and Image integration\r\nTopaz 5.1 for noise reduction\r\nPhotoshop for Curves, Color and Saturation adjustments",
