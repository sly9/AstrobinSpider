    "description": "This nebula seems to be very strong in both Ha and OIII, so I attempted to process it with just 7 hours of data.  My original plan was to do the Hubble Palette on it, but I can't seem to get enough clear skies.  Now the Monkey Head is already at the meridian as soon as it gets dark, so I may have to wait until next year to capture SII data (unless I get some clear skies soon).",
