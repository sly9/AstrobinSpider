    "description": "Got some new data from the DCT, always a happy day :) \r\n\r\nA fun target, that I just finished myself a few days ago. Wish I knew this was coming, would have waited and combined it all in one! The active optics of the DCT never disappoint though, giving absolutely insane levels of sharpness for a ground based telescope in addition to the equally insane levels of sensitivity of the sensor on the LMI. Crazy to think what 11 minutes of exposure can achieve. There was some additional data in the IR and UV, but I decided not to really use it. I did find it interesting though that the IR showed pretty much none of the Ha data, while the UV showed it everywhere. Would have definitely guessed the opposite. \r\n\r\nA fun target to process, sadly they are closed down for now just like everyone else. I am hopeful I'll get some more fun things to play with though once it reopens! \r\n\r\nHuge thanks to the Lowell Observatoryâ€™s Discovery Channel Telescope which made these results possible.",
