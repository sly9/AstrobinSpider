    "description": "NGC133 is a bright reflection nebula about 1000 light years away in the Perseus Molecular Cloud.  It contains a very active star forming region and is surrounded by Dark Nebula Barnard 205.  Nearby are reflection nebulas VdB12 and VdB13.  Also, the upper left shows Dark Nebula Barnard 3, in the middle is Barnard 1, and the lower right shows Barnard 203, 204, and 206.  \r\n\r\nI first discovered this region in a widefield shot with my camera lens and I was looking forward to revisiting with my new setup.  This was taken over two nights as I worked around cold temperatures and passing clouds.  Here is my version of NGC1333:\r\n\r\nCanon 6D modified\r\nISO 1600\r\n67 x 300 sec\r\nSV80ST at 480 mm f/6\r\nCEM60",
