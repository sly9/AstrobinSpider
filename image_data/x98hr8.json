    "description": "This beautiful little cluster is nicknamed The Southern Pleiades.  At a distance of approximately 547 light years from Earth, it is one of the closest to us.  At a magnitude of 1.9, it is 70% fainter than it's northern cousin and it lacks the billowing dust clouds of the Taurean Pleiades, but I still think it is very beautiful.\r\n\r\nC and C always welcome!\r\nTim.",
