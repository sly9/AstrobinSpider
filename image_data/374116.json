    "description": "I shot these targets together for the first time last year. Although I considered last year's image good at that time, my processing skills got better and I found that the data allowed to bring more details into view. As I was not happy with the quality of the optics I used last year, I started over, now with the SkyWatcher 72ED mounted on the EQ6-R. FWHM in the final stacks was 1.4 - 1.8px.\r\n\r\nFor the final image, I used the narrowband data from last year too, included only at the dark side of the histogram.\r\n\r\nSomehow, I hope I don't need to start over next year :)",
