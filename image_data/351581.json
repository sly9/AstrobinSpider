    "description": "This is the 3rd night in a row that I have been able to run from sun down to sun up. Which feels unbelievably  awesome after the months of overcast weather we are coming out of here in the Northeast.\r\n\r\nThis image is three nights, three frames stitched together of the Cepheus / Cygnus area of the Milky Way. Captured with a Canon 70d modified, Canon 50mm STM lens on an AVX mount.\r\n\r\nIf you have not viewed the previous posts Ive made here yesterday or the day before I am attempting to image the entire belt from Cepheus down to Sagittarius, or close to it.",
