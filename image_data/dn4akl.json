    "description": "This is a colour image of the famous elongated crater Schiller. Located on the Southwestern limb of the moon, its elongated shape is accentuated by the viewing angle from the Earth. At this stage the moon was almost full at 93% illumination, 11days & 18.6 hours old which gives a lovely fairly full illumination of Schiller. The terraced walls on the northern part of the crater are in wonderful relief. The crater appears to the fusion of two or more craters and its flat floor is clear evidence of lava inundation, where craters of approximately 500m in diameter can be resolved. \r\nI also imaged the crater in IR (642nm BP) and I have included this as revision E. The resolution in the colour image is superior as I think you'll agree. I put together collage with the two images and an LRO image of the crater floor to demonstrate the super resolution of the colour image vs the IR image and the scale of craters that are being resolved. The line of craters visible in the LRO and colour images where the arrow is pointing is not visible in the IR 642nm BP image.\r\nRevision B is an annotated version and can be accessed by the mouse-over.",
