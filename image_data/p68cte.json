    "description": "NGC 104, also known as 47 Tucanae, is located in the Southern constellation of Tucanae.  It lies at a distance of 16,700 light-years from us and is about 120 light-years across.  It is visible to the naked eye, shining at a magnitude of 4.9 and appears about as big as the full Moon.  It's the second brightest global cluster, only Omega Centauri outshines it.  It has a very dense core and the entire cluster contains millions of stars.\r\nThis is an LRGB image taken at Deep Sky West-Chile with the TOA-150/FLI ML16200.  It's mostly RGB processed with just a hint of L, so as not to overwhelm the core.\r\nHope ya like it!\r\nTom",
