    "description": "Spectrum of Jupiter. Imaged with SA-100 diffraction grating objective mounted on 135mm SLR lens and SBIG ST-8300M camera. 30 2.5s light frames and 30 dark frames calibrated, aligned and stacked with ImagesPlus. Spectrum calculated by RSpec. The spectrum has not been corrected for instrument response.\r\n\r\nI have used the Jupiter spectrum found in the \"Spectroscopic Atlas for Amateur Astronomers\" (Version 3, page 119) by Richard Walker as the reference. The observed features are color-coded; yellow indicates features in the Sun's spectrum, red is for features not seen in the solar spectrum and originating in Jupiter's atmosphere, and blue indicates features caused by the Earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis is very similar to the spectrum of Saturn observed the same evening. I tried to isolate the spectra of Ganymede, Io, and Callisto, but failed. Maybe next time :)",
