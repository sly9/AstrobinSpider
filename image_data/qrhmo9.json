    "description": "Mare Cognitum it is an ancient impact pool. Its edges and dark interior are visible. Craters: Bullialdus, Lansberg i Reinhold. Montes Riphaeus or the ancient Ural is a very good determinant of the shape of the Known Sea. This region, although it does not contain spectacular formations, is still visually very attractive and I haven't got enough of it yet.",
