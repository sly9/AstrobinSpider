    "description": "There is something about this huge sphere that gets to me.  This is the first planetary nebula I've captured and it was another battle with clouds and seeing but so long as you're not pixel peeping I feel it is a decent image.  I probably should have thrown away more exposures but my desire for integration time won out.  At least this target will be high in the sky for me for quite a while longer and can be imaged almost any time of night so perhaps I will add time to as I wait for other targets to rise.  So long as I can get some clear nights.",
