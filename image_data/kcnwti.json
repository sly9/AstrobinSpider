    "description": "I started taking photos of the subject in the second half of the winter and it took a long time due to the weather to collect the pictures. One of my most cozy pastimes was to spot it with the new binoculars while this photo was taken.\n\nI thought of publishing the image in full cutout, but somehow the location of the stars was attacked by a feeling that a huge star city moving there in vast outer space filled me almost endlessly, with a slightly strange feeling, so I left the field of view.\n\nThe color of the galaxies I feel can be brought out well, but the picture isn’t really good heavens, though it was made, but the situation was mostly done for this, which I don’t care so much about. The experience is more, health is a great treasure.\n:)",
