    "description": "M104 - The Sombrero Galaxy in Virgo. \r\n\r\nMy first completed image in 2 months...Late winter/early spring has typically been bad AP weather here in Austin, so clear nights haven't been many. I did manage to eke out enough frames on this to call it done. I literally shot 4-5 frames a night on it with high clouds to complete this one.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to shoot this galaxy for a long time but due to its declination (-11 degrees), I don't get a good view on this one and each year I ended up missing it. This time I was determined to keep at it.  I probably pushed it too hard but at this point, I am quite happy given the precious few color subs I got to work with.\r\n\r\n45x5 min for L\r\n5x3 min for R/G/B",
