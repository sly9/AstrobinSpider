    "description": "m20 captured in LRGB with 2 different setup, C8 for Luminance layer and Canon 70-200 mm for RGB layers. The RGB channels were cropped and drizzled by 3. I used image solver and MosaicbyCoordinates script from Pixinsinght to align perfectly luminance and RGB channels. The focal length was 200mm @f2,8. \r\nTo benefit from the background captured in RGB with high aperture(f2,8), I fusionned its Luminance layer carefully with the luminance get from the C8.",
