    "description": "I love this nebula--so many vistas of the mysterious and, in this case, grotesque.  The gruesome Titans  assail Mount Olympus--tower of the gods.  One thing Astrophotography is good for is the imagination.  We can do the unthinkable...peer into alien worlds through time and space and capture for others to see mysteries of the universe.  As long as its not cloudy, or to windy, or to much Moon, or too humid, or there isn't too much smoke from forest fires, or too  much light pollution, or......well, you get the picture.  I love this nebula!\r\n\r\nThe elephants trunk itself includes higher resolution, longer focal length data from the TOA 130. (15 hours using the STT-8300 camera)--only the original version.  I removed it in the first (anticipating) revision due to an artifact.",
