    "description": "I have been fascinated with this object since the first time I saw it on Astrobin.  I finally decided it was time to give it a try.  The low surface brightness of this object had me concerned, and rightly so.  Ou-4 wasn't even visible in a single frame.  I think the result is ok, but it was really exciting to open up the stacked image the first time and see the squid popping out when I couldn't see it at all in the raw frames.",
