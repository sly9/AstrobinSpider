    "description": "The elephants trunk is a quite often exposed image of the IC 1396 region. But there are more interesting regions in that object that I find worth to be imaged. For I am a real globule fan, I choose this region here as target. Again I aided the weak OIII signal with some CLS filtered subs. While imaging, I found another interesting part which should captured. So I hope for better weather.",
