    "description": "NGC 281 is a bright emission nebula and part of an H II region in the northern constellation of Cassiopeia and is part of the Milky Way's Perseus Spiral Arm. It is located approximately 9,200 light-years away from my balcony.\r\n\r\nThis is a target I am revisiting 2 years later, old attempt on the below link:\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/380857/?image_list_page=2&nc=&nce=\r\n\r\nGiven the latest pandemic lock downs, the balcony is all I have. Which means, back to the usual targets in my FOV, and the 30 to 60 degrees window altitude wise. But, looking at the bright side, Polaris is in my FOV. \r\n\r\nAnd on an even brighter side, I miraculously  acquired a very old esprit 120 I found locally (hence the miraculous part). It has the old focuser and has the serial number #00003 under it. Not sure if that means something though.\r\n\r\nAs always, comments and feedback are much appreciated. I hope everyone out there is staying safe, and having decent hours under clear skies.",
