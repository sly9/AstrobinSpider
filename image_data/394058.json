    "description": "* Image acquisition by: <a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/users/gvarouha/\">George Varouhakis</a>.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n\r\nHere is 2 panel mosaic of the Running Chicken Nebula in narrowband.\r\n\r\nIC 2944, also known as the Running Chicken Nebula is an open cluster with an associated emission nebula found in the constellation Centaurus, near the star λ Centauri.\r\n\r\nIt features Bok globules, which are frequently a site of active star formation. However, no evidence for star formation has been found in any of the globules in IC 2944.\r\n\r\nThe region of nebulosity includes both IC 2944 and IC 2948, as well as the fainter IC 2872 nearby. IC 2948 is the brightest emission and reflection nebulae towards the southeast, while IC 2944 is the cluster of stars and surrounding nebulosity stretching towards λ Centauri.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/396580/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/396580/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
