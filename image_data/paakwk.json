    "description": "Weather, new equipment, some technical issues, software issues... ah, the joys of Astrophotography.  This is a combination of 3 nights of data, some of which has some issues that I just went with and let PI sort it out, to what I think is a good result.  I had to crop quite heavily due to what I think is an issue with the camera sensor.  I'm quite happy with the level of dust I brought out - the blues of the Iris and the stars could be brighter, something I need to look at with the camera.  A definite learning curve with all the new gear!",
