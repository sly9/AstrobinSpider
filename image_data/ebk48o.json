    "description": "Barred spiral galaxy NGC 2903 is only some 30 million light-years away in the constellation of Leo. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. NGC2903 has a very high rate of star formation in its central region. NGC2905 is a bright star cluster within this galaxy. NGC2903 is part of the Virgo galaxy cluster. Beyond the bright parts of the galaxy some evidence of extended low emission can be seen which is difficult to see in this representation",
