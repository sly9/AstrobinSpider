    "description": "this field in Vela shows the emission nebula Gum 17 in center, but there is more Gum to the picture:\r\nTop left starts with Gum 20, then tiny Gum 19, Gum 17, and at bottom right Gum 15. Some reflection nebulosity is there as well, and some filaments of the huge Vela supernova remnant stray in from the left.\r\n\r\nEos77d modded on  Canon 300mm L at open f/4, the mount was a G11 carrying two Eos at different targets, guided by MGEN.",
