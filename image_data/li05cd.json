    "description": "My imaging partner found this part of the witch's head nebula to resemble a ghost, much like IC 63 and NGC 7023.  Given the season, we thought it was appropriate to shoot!  Also, first combined data set from both of our rigs located in Fort Davis, Texas (14\" CDK+SV130) which allowed us to capture this target in two imaging sessions!",
