    "description": "This is an LRGB image of M106 in Canes Venatici.  Referring to  Jeff Kanipe and Dennis Webb, <i>Annals of the Deep Sky, vol. 3</i>, M106 is classified as a \"barred LINER spiral with a Seyfert 2 nucleus.\"  It has magnitude 8.4, size 18.6' x 7.2'.  It has a prominent nucleus with double S-shaped spiral arms extending N and S from the center.  Surrounding this is a fainter region showing wispy star-forming knots that can be seen in my image.\r\n\r\nOne of the prominent features of this galaxy that has been deduced is a super massive black hole.  The central object has \"a mass of 36 million suns packed within a volume less than 0.8 of a light year ... in diameter.\"  This is a region of size 51,000 AU's.\r\n\r\nIts distance is measured to be 7.2 Mpc or 23.5 Mly.\r\n\r\nTo the upper right is companion galaxy NGC 4248, visual magnitude 12.5.  Although a bit small in my image, one can see its irregular elongated shape with bright central ridge.\r\n\r\nMy C11 Edge system on the AP Mach1 mount continues to exhibit a prominent underdamped vibration, which can be seen in the stars as vertical elongation.  I hope to have this and some other issues resolved soon.  As a consequence of these issues, I needed to darken the background more than I would have wished, and I also felt compelled to take additional processing steps in deconvolution and sharpening that I would prefer to forgo in the future once the issues have been resolved.  I also pushed the noise reduction, particularly in the color channels, a bit more than I had intended.  If I return to process the data again I will dial these steps back a bit.",
