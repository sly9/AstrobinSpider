    "description": "van den Bergh 14 and 15 are  a pair of reflection nebula located in Camelopardalis, close to Sh2-202 (which is edging into the right hand side of the frame). vdB 15 (to the south) has an interesting pinkish/yellow component to it - it provides a real challenge in getting both the colour and saturation correct. Additionally, a very rich star field complements the field but makes it hard to prevent it overwhelming the nebulae. \r\n\r\nBy adding H-Alpha data into the mix, it enhances the regions of hydrogen emission that encroach on and faintly pervade the area: not far away to the west are the Heart and Soul - it's a very busy area of sky. \r\n\r\nThere is a tiny (almost stellar in nature at this scale!) planetary nebula, catalogued as Kohoutek 3-64, to the left of the frame, that shines like a small pink beacon in the light of H-alpha. \r\n\r\nThe brighter region of hydrogen emission to the bottom left of the image appears to be catalogued as IRAS 03306+5825/Lyder-Galt B03306+5825 - the HII region above vdB14 (and above left from Sh2-202) is catalogued as Lyder-Galt B03211+6018. \r\n\r\nData was captured Dec 2020/Jan 2021.\r\n\r\nImage Capture: Paul Tribe & Graeme Coates\r\nProcessing: Graeme Coates",
