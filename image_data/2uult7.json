    "description": "Ngc 4206, 4216, and 4222 are three galaxies in the Virgo cluster. They are located at a distance of approximately 50 - 60 Mly. The most interesting of the three is the one in the middle.\r\n\r\nNgc 4216 is a barred spiral galaxy of type SAB(s)b, and is one of the larger galaxies in the Virgo cluster.\r\nNgc 4216 forms a pair with the smaller galaxy just above it in this image, VCC 165 (LEDA 39247). The galaxy is subject to ongoing research after it was found to have several tidal star streams. These streams are likely the result of accretion events where satellite galaxies are being drawn into the main galaxy.\r\nWhat is particularly intruiging is the fact that one of the tidal streams contains three dwarf galaxies, two of which are visible and indicated in the annotated image. It has been speculated that these dwarfs, rather than being absorbed by ngc 4216, may be forming in the tidal stream. (S. Paudel et al., The Astrophysical Journal, 767:133 (11pp), 2013 April 20)",
