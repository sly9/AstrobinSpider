    "description": "A mosaic that I captured from my backyard with my QSI 683 and a 135mm Rokinon lens over the summer. This is my first mosaic and had I know how difficult processing it was going to be I wouldn't have been so ambitious (or naive). I just wish that I would have discovered Astro Pixel Processor sooner. It's simply amazing how well it was able to integrate all 20 frames together.",
