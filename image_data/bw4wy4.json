    "description": "NGC 1760 is a large nebula and star forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a dwarf galaxy that orbits the Milky Way galaxy. The LMC, estimated to be about 14,000 light years in diameter,  is a busy little galaxy, with many bright nebula and star forming regions.  NGC 1760 became entry N11 in one of several catalogs of LMC objects produced by astronomer Karl Gordon Henize.  My earlier image of NGC 2032, https://www.astrobin.com/rumvuk/?nc=user, also contains a number of Henize catalog objects and the region is so busy that our telescope team at Deep Sky West Chile decided to add an adjoining panel containing more nebulae (I'll get back to producing that when time allows).  I like this target due to the combination of glowing hydrogen filaments that add detail and contrast and competing cloud structures of ionized oxygen.  The RGB composition was enhanced with hydrogen and oxygen narrow band data.",
