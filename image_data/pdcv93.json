    "description": "I thought I would have a go at some of Jim Misti's data once again, now that I have this new monitor. Admittedly with the amount of data I have to play with, it is a bit of a push for a 27\" Quad HD monitor screen, but the background is better on less resolved screens. Jim used a Ritchey-Chretien 32\" Telescope, at f7.2 and a SBIG STL-11000 CCD camera. Exposure was 12 x 5 minutes Luminance unbinned and 4 x 5 minutes each R/G/B unbinned. Integration time: 2 hours.",
