    "description": "M101 presents itself fully face-on and that, combined with its large size makes it a treat to image.  There are so many details to explore and tease out that it's hard to know where to stop.\r\n\r\nThis was processed twice, once with PI and one with CCDStack/PS.  The PI version benefited from HDRMT and DBE and the CCDStack version had a warmer color balance that brought out the dark lanes nicely.  I blended them 50/50 in Photoshop with the background being mostly from PI.\r\n\r\nHa was added to the blend.  I shot OIII as well, but not enough to use without a large noise increase.",
