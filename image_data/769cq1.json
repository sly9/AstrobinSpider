Wikipedia describes it as having two rather smooth spiral arms that enfold the entire galaxy, and that the arms have “few bright spots.” My image shows a considerable number of bright blue star-birth locations, however. Varela, ET al. (1996) describe it as having “moderate circumnuclear starbursts.” The overall length of the galaxy is about 5.25 arcmin; not a large target. But it’s nearly equatorial location makes it well accessible to observations from both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\r\n\r\nNGC 7606 does not belong to a galaxy cluster, has a supermassive black hole, is classified as a Sab galaxy, has a redshift of 0.007.",
