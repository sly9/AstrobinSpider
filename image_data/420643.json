    "description": "This is just a reprocess of the M17 that I posted last month: https://astrob.in/414497\r\n\r\nHa 3nm: 47x600\" -25C bin 1x1\r\nOIII 3nm: 49x600\" -25C bin 1x1\r\nSII 3nm: 49x600\" -25C bin 1x1\r\n\r\nTotal integration: 24.2 hours\r\n\r\nThe original pass on this one was a combination of impatient rush job, first time working with SHO and not quite having my PI integration flow fully nailed down with a new camera setup... so this is a re-pop from scratch with a tightened up processing flow and a [hopefully!] more dynamic and interesting color scheme. Yes, I know the NR is too much - I overdid it early on and was too lazy to go back and fix it. :-) I also incorporated the use of Nikita's wonderful StarNet++ PI module (https://www.astrobin.com/397290/), which greatly reduces the always tedious and time consuming chore of creating usable star masks... will definitely be adding this to my tool box!",
