    "description": "NO COMET today - sorry for that!! :-D\r\n\r\nI was late, \"Little Neo\" was too low already and I had enough of comets anyway so, I went out for fishing this time - in Cepheus!\r\n\r\nAnd, surprise-surprise, I caught a shark! :-)\r\n\r\nI was lucky to have an unusually dark sky that night. Exeptional seeing and clarity allowed to even see the limit between nautical dark to astrodark! As soon as it had passed the \"hat\" of Cepheus I started exposing. The full astrodark period could be used to collect data from this object. A lucky 100% yield delivered 152 minutes through an f/2.8 aperture. On a single frame there was nothing to see of a shark, not even the slightest sign of a cloud or nebula, just stars. This makes an imaging session kind of spooky when you see nothing of the target at all. Fishing in the dark. You need to trust.... and hope! ;-)\r\n\r\nOnly stacking followed by background extraction finally revealed the fish - there it was! The first time I saw it appearing in the picture. Thanks to low iso the noise level was pretty low already, MLT and ACDNR did the rest. \r\n\r\nI actually planned to collect a second set of data but weather didn't let me, yet. Excellent conditions are required for this faint fish. However, I'm happy to have come this far already, no complaints ;-)\r\n\r\nClear skies!!!\r\nOkke",
