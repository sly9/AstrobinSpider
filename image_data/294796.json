    "description": "Due to the star eater bug of my Sony A6000, I have to change my typical imaging setting (60s, ISO800, f/2.8) to 30s, ISO800, f/2. Theoretically, it's still the same amount of light that I collect per frame. The advantage is that my stars are now much smaller, even at f/2, due to less error of the Star Adventurer.\r\nSince the shot was taken in bright moonlight, I cannot say if I got less red sensitivity. \r\nNow I am prepared for some improved mosaic shots! I will not try the whole milky way again, but several interesting regions.",
