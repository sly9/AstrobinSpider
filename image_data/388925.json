    "description": "This is another image from new remote setup in Marathon Texas. The equpiment is shared by myself  and Dhaval Brambhatt. \r\n\r\nI was shooting this whenever moon was up and whenever the main target M82 was not up. The Ha data itsef is quite decent but couldnt manage to get good amount of  OIII and SII . The guiding at meridian isnt good and the OIII/SII suffered as a result. Also, lots of dew problems resulting in bad SNR during SII and OIII (No dew heater at the moment).\r\n\r\nProcessing was done with Hubble mapping and additional tweaks to it. The resolution itself is quite good in Ha and I am happy with the way it came out.\r\n\r\nHa - 26x15min\r\nOIII - 6x15min\r\nSII - 12x15 min",
