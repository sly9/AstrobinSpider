    "description": "At 09:18 CET on the morning of 19 June 2020 the Moon was about to pass in front of the planet Venus. Imaging this by daylight was a bit of a challenge, especially as the sun was nearby, but using a short exposure (1/100th second) and a red filter managed to capture the moment just before Venus disappeared. It's interesting to note that with Venus being so much farther away it is far more illuminated than the Moon, which is only 4% illuminated.",
