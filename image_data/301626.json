    "description": "Within the Southern Constellation Chamaeleon, lies beautiful fillaments of dust and dark nebulae. The Chamaeleon Molecular Cloud, whuch is potrayed in this image, \"lies some 400 to 600 light years from Earth, and contains tens of thousands of solar masses of gas and dust. \" [Wikipedia]\r\n\r\nThe extremely faint dust, in strongly southern declinations (~ -75º) makes this a challenge - both for capturing and processing. I personally see this dust regions as bein the \"Southern\" version of the IFN - the latter much more captured by amateurs. Indeed, this Molecular complex appears to be rarely imaged (especially in such wide fields), according to a quick search. Furthermore, even from my 22ºS latitude, this object never rises for more than 40º, and LP from nearby cities become more of a factor so close to the horizon.\r\n\r\nI must admit I was really surprised by how this image turned out. The starting data was already pretty good, with extremely clear and stable skiy conditions. Processing was by no means easy, as to bring out such faint details, in such a rich starfiels is a challenge. In order to capture the faint gas and dust, this is my longest integration time thus far (although less than most deeper images around the web), at 2h or 120min. Finally, to sum things up, I just really liked the final result!\r\n\r\n*Please check the full image 1800px - resized from original)*\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, comments and suggestions are more than welcome in the comments section. Thank's for taking your time to look at this image.\r\n\r\nTaken from Rural Skies (Bortle 3-4; NELM ~6.2; SQM ~21.6*calculated), from Cristina, MG, Brazil (22ºS latitude).\r\n\r\nDate and Time: June 15th, 2017, at 20h (UTC-3, start of capture)\r\nCamera: Unmodded Canon T4i/650D, at ISO 800\r\nLens: Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8, operated at 200mm f/3.5\r\nMount: Sky-Watcher HEQ5, tracking, guided (\r\nGuiding: Starguider 50mm Guidescope + ASI120mm + PHD2; ~1.8\" RMS\r\nExposure Detail: 30x240s (total 120min)",
