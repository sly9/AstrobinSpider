    "description": "Escaping from Sadr influence the blazing butterfly illuminates the sky! \r\nOk no science here but a redux of 2019 data :)\r\nInsanely hard streched data to do the trick and I also chose a warm deep color palette. O3 was a hell as usual despite 250mins...some many LP chunk goes through.\r\n\r\nPre-proc APP\r\nProc: Pix, PS and a denoise try with Topaz (used lightly for denoise and not sharpening - made my best to avoid the dreaded checkerboard pattern)\r\n\r\nThat was fun!",
