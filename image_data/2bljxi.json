    "description": "I had good seeing this morning and made two runs on Mars ~ 1.5 hours apart. Both these images shows the Hellas Basin more clearly than my image of 2 days ago. It seems that there is a dust storm across it and probably impacting the southerly parts of Syrtis Major and spreading to the Hesperia Planum and Mare Tyrrhenum. There also appears to be distinct bands of dust. \r\nThe bright spot on the p side of Syrtis Major is still there and there is also one to the north of the promontory.\r\nThe white bulge from the SPC remains. It could be lighter coloured dust clouds given its longevity, which I believe makes the more transient water ice clouds a less likely possibility.\r\nThe mouse-over shows the position of the dust clouds.",
