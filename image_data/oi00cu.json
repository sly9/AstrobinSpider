    "description": "As a fan of this fantastic region,I took this part of the sky with wide range of instruments during past years.Last year I decided to make a mosaic image of the region with a 200mm f/2.8L lens.I already took exactly the same composition with 200mm lens in 2014 but under a moderate sky condition.So this time tried to take the first panel of mosaic the same as the previous image from 2014 to process it seperatly and make the same field but with much better data.Here is the result.\r\nI hope enjoy!\r\nCanon EOS 5D MII Modded\r\nCanon 200mm L f/2.8 @ f/2.8\r\nAZ-EQ6 Unguided\r\n40*3min For 2Hours\r\nISO 1600",
