    "description": "The Whirlpool Galaxy is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici and lies some 23 million light years away.  It's an interacting galaxy pair and was the first to be identified as a spiral galaxy.  This interaction has set up waves of star formation through the compression of interstellar hydrogen gas and dust.  These dust lanes are prominent features of the Whirlpool.  The Whirlpool has been host to several supernovae, the most recent of which was SN2011dh.",
