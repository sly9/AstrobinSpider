    "description": "It's taken a little while since my last image, but I finally got a chance to work on my February data from Messier 78. \r\n\r\nFor me, this is one of the most stunning places in Orion. The reflection parts of M78 are bordered on all sides by dark nebulae and contrast strongly with the H-alpha foothills of Barnard's Loop, which shine brightly like a great wall.\r\n\r\nAs with some of my past images, the combination of the Takahashi Epsilon together with my ZWO OSC turns out as a real dream team. :-)",
