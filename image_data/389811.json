    "description": "Finally, after more than two months I had some clear nights again, in which I could do some photography. Actually I had thought (after the bad weather phase exactly one year before) that this could not happen again. But - that's life. ;-)\r\n\r\nSince the clear nights were exactly on the last full moon phase, of course only narrow band imaging was possible. The goal of the desire was the fish head nebula, which revealed some fine details. But see for yourself. :-)",
