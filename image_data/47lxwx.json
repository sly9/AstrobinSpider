    "description": "I decided to reprocess the Pacman I shot 1 year ago, since no new finished project is in sight with this weather... I started from the integration phase and used Mure Denoise in the linear state and no other noise reduction in Pixinsight in the non linear state. It is a SHO palette with RGB stars, which were added as such on the starless image (instead of only using the color information). Clear skies !",
