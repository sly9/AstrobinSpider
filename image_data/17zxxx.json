    "description": "I have been integrating Hb into my images lately. This abundant emission is in the blue channel making the overall colour different from most. I use narrowband Ha in the red, OIII in the green and Hb in the blue, true to their wavelengths. Then I blend in the RGB stars. Hb is often attenuated by surrounding dust and doesn't show through or add much to an image, but when dust is blown away, it can be more exposed and its blue colour changes the deep reds to brighter pinks as seen in the surrounding nebula in this image.\r\n\r\nR:G:B:40:35:40mins. Ha:OIII:Hb:170: 160:120 mins.",
