    "description": "Mapped SII to Yellow (Sulfur), OIII to Blue (Oxygen) and Ha to Red (Hydrogen).\r\n\r\nM76, also known as the Little Dumbbell Nebula, lies at an approximate distance of 2,500 light years from Earth. M76 was formed when a Sun-like star ran out of fuel in a late stage of its life and then expelled its outer layers. The expelled material was then heated by the radiation of the stellar remnant, producing the glowing clouds that we see as the nebula. The clouds will disperse over the next several thousand years and the central white dwarf will eventually cool and fade away.",
