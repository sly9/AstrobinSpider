    "description": "I took this image between November 2018 and February 2019 using broadband filters because I wanted to bring up all the beautiful colors of the reflection portion and the stars that surround the nebula.  I live in a Bortle 7-8 area and the light pollution wrecked havoc with the result when I processed it.   On the other hand, the scope I was using had some issues with its optics that really frustrated me back then. \r\n\r\nFast forward , yesterday and after two years of intense learning on how to use PixInsight I decided to give it another try.  Here is the result I got.  In my opinion PixInsight has a very steep learning curve but once you learn how to use it properly you can get amazing results with it.",
