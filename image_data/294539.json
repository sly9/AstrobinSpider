    "description": "Another galaxy processed from Liverpool Telescope data. Not completely happy with this one. Looks a bit too solid and chunky I think, but not sure how to change that. One reason could be the lack of those bright star-forming regions that usually light up galaxies. I get a similar impression from other images I found of M88 on the net, so maybe it is an old and very mature galaxy with not much happening.\r\n\r\nData:\r\n\r\n9 x 90 s Bessell B (for blue channel)\r\n\r\n9 x 90 s Bessell V (for green channel)\r\n\r\n19 x 90 s sdss-r (for red channel)\r\n\r\nSo, totally a bit less than an hours",
