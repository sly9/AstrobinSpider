    "description": "Spiral Galaxy in Hydra (NGC 3717) NGC 3717 is visible as nearly edge-on galaxy showing a distinct dust band in the constellation Hydra. It is about 80 million light years away from the solar system, and it extends 3.5 arc-min in the sky.\r\nSurprisingly the galaxy features some faint extension to the south (star stream), an indication of possible tidal interaction with another galaxy.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly the galaxy features some faint extension to the south (star stream), an indication of possible tidal interaction with another galaxy.
