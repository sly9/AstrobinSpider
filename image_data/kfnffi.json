When processing the file, I figured it would be nice to incorporate more data from my images of the same region from 2018. Then, I added an extra 2h shot with the Samyang 135mm, in what ended up being a 2-panel mosaic. At the end, 3 integrated masters were merged, with equivalent field of a 1x2-panel mosaic, with extra detail around the “E”, data from the 200mm lens. The Milky Way dark clouds contrast with the myriad of stars, and the yellow-coloured Milky Way shines brightly. The field has a lot of faint dust, especially around Altair. Here is my processing of this beautiful Northern field.\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, comments and suggestions are more than welcome in the comments section.\r\n\r\nDates: 11 Aug 2018, 7 Sep 2019 and 30 July 2019\r\nLocations: MG and 12th EBA, GO, Brazil.
