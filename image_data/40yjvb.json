    "description": "The cluster NGC 3590 and the hand that nearly touch it. It is one half of my previous image on this cluster, but now in SHO. It is a wonderful area for its richness in clouds, clusters Bok structures and so on. Still I have more work in progress on it due to its immense attractiveness.\r\nScope CHI-1 at El Sauce, a CDK24 reflector 61cm f/6.5, and I requested S-H-O filters as a sequence H/S/O in 8/4/6 exposures of 300\" each.\r\nCamera FLI PL 9000 with 3 nm Astrodon filters.",
