    "description": "The above image is a single 40-second exposure of Sirius, just to see what it would look like. I wondered if the open cluster Gaia 1 would be visible. The cluster was discovered in 2017 and is  located near the left edge of this image, where a backwards \"7\" can be seen. It is estimated to lie about 15,000 light-years away. I haven't yet determined if the stars in the \"Reverse 7\" are part of the cluster.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this long exposure image, I also took a set of very short exposures of Sirius in order to look for it's white dwarf companion, \"The Pup\". Here's a link to the stacked image:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/4y49rn/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/4y49rn/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
