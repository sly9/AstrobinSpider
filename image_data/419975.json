    "description": "NGC7331 and the Quintet in HaLRGB using dual TEC 140s, Atik 460, Moravian 8300 and Mesu 200. Kit jointly owned with Tom O'Donoghue and Steve and Lis Milne. Captured with guest Dave Boddington. Luminance 32x15 mins. Colours 18x10 each. Ha 24x15 mins. The aim in this processing was to feature the galaxies and subdue the stars at the expense of the faint IFN which was present in the data. Radio data shows that the curved tidal tail which seems to emanate from the blue spiral in the Quintet actually comes from the interacting pair seen below it in this orientation. This resolves the controversy which arose from the blue galaxy's redshift placing it much closer than the other four. The Quintet was discovered at Marseille observatory about 150 km from my site in a telescope made by Foucault of pendulum fame.",
