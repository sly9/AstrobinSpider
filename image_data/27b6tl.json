    "description": "Well this was a fun night  photographing the milky way through a few collapsed sections of a lava-tube. It was very dark and scary especially because of some bats flying around me! Luckily after some trial and error I was finally able to get this neat shot.  Hope you all enjoy and thanks for any constructive comments.",
