    "description": "This is a faint reflection nebula thought to be a possible super nova remnant or large gas cloud that is illuminated by the bright star Rigel. Rigel is the right lower foot star in the Orion Constellation. The nebula is located approximately 900 light years away.\r\n\r\nAfter completing my OSC color, I wanted to to try to draw out the faint hydrogen alpha present on the right portion of the image.  I used the hydrogen alpha data as a luminance data at 30% and then added in the Ha red using NBRGBcombo in pixinsight. The added data definitely gives the image a lot of more dynamic color. \r\n\r\nI am curious if this hydrogen gas cloud is part of the great molecular cloud in Orion or may be part of the larger super nova remenant of Barnard's Loop. I was not able to find the distinction with a quick search.",
