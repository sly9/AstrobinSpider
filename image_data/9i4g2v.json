    "description": "My second attempt on the great summer comet 2020. This time I stepped down the aperture one step from 2.8 to 3.2 (what was a bad idea) and increased the exposure time (what was a good idea). Still tracked on the MiniTrack LX2 (which was again a bad idea for the heavy Samyang 135) but I needed to be a bit faster that night... Good idea for the future: trust a bit more your weather app... Longer story ;-) \r\n\r\nHowever, the APP calibrated images were stacked on the comet in DSS and post-processed in PI and PS. Hope you like it :-)",
