    "description": "This is an interesting area with a variety of galaxy shapes, but it is not a great image. There were thin high clouds that caused horrible gradients and caused the star spikes to seemingly go on forever. I used PixInsight and DBE'ed this to death, but a few gradients refused to come out completely. Also, the framing isn't great - it could use a bit of camera rotation. I like this field enough that I plan on revisiting it sometime in the future.",
