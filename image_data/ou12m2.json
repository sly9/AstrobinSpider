    "description": "NGC 6992 The Eastern Veil Nebula\r\nA wonderful example of a supernova shock wave hitting the interstellar medium, this intricate weave of excited Ha and Oiii is a favorite for astrophotographers and is just one part of a much bigger complex called the Cygnus Loop. \r\nThe shock wave was produced some 21,000 years ago when a star 20 times more massive than the Sun went supernova, the Cygnus is also a strong source of radio and x-rays.\r\nJuly 2019\r\nLennox and Addington Dark Sky Viewing Area",
