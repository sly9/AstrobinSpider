    "description": "Abell 61 (PK 077.6+14.7) is pretty faint and pretty ancient planetary nebula in Cygnus. It is located somewhere aroud 4,500 light years away and its age is estimated to 22,000 years. Central star apparent brightness is 17mag and its surface temperature is over 60,000 K. Apparent diameter of Abell 61 is about 3.3 arc minutes, so it is similar size as famous M97 Owl nebula. But Abell 61 is about 100 times fainter.\r\n\r\nThis image taken over several nights in September 2019.",
