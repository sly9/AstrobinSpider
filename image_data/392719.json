    "description": "A series of my images, assembled to allow comparisons particularly of the colour changes in the EZ.  It seems to my eye that the current yellow-orange tinge begins to emerge around March 2018.\r\n\r\nThe images up to 2017 were captured with an 8SE; using a variety of cameras; for 2018 on, they were taken with a C11 and a ZWO224MC.   The 2019 images so far are poor, in part due to low altitude, in part due to poor seeing, but I think the colour changes are real.",
