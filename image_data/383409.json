    "description": "One more set of dark nebulae from the IC1396 nebula complex, which maybe resembles a hybrid between a bunny and an Alien :-). About 2400 light-years distant, the upper section here is about twenty light-years across. Thatâ€™s quite a lot of dust in one place, considering that it blocks the light behind it almost completely! From left to right the different sections of this dark nebulae have been cataloged as LDN1087, Barnard 365 (LDN1090) and LDN1085.",
