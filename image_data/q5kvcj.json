    "description": "Messier 92 is a globular cluster of stars in the northern constellation of Hercules and it is at a distance of about 26,700 light-years away from Earth. It is very tightly packed with stars, containing some 330 000 stars in total.\r\n\r\nM92 has an estimated mass of up to 330,000 solar masses. The cluster is approaching us at 112 km/s. \r\n\r\nWith an estimated age of 14.2 billion years – almost the same age as the universe itself – M92 is one of the oldest clusters known and possibly the single oldest globular in the Milky Way. The cluster has an extremely low abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium.\r\n\r\nSource: Wikipedia, messier-objects, NASA",
