From Wiki:\r\n\r\nMessier 95, also known as M95 or NGC 3351, is a barred spiral galaxy located about 38 million light-years away in the zodiac constellation Leo. It was discovered by Pierre MÃ©chain in 1781, and catalogued by fellow French astronomer Charles Messier four days later. On 16 March 2012, a supernova was discovered in M95.  Adam Block rendered the super nova here:  \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120322.html\" target=\"new\">Adam's M95 with Supernova SN2012aw</a>",
