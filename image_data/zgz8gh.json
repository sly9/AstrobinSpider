    "description": "It's been a while since I posted anything here. Did not have chance to spend time on my hobby since end of October 2020.\r\n\r\nThe data for this shot was collected in the middle of October in Arkhyz, Russia. On the \"astrofarm\" belonging to wonderful people who call themselves \"Astroverty\".\r\nIt's probably one of the best places in Russia for astrophotographers, the location is 2000m high, really dark skies. The fact that the biggest telescope in Russia , called BTA (primary mirror diameter is 6 meters) located just few hundreds meters away speaks for itself :)\r\n\r\nBig thanks to everyone from Astroverty group! I want to come back, because it is very addicting to have access to such dark skies :)\r\n\r\nSo here it is, gorgeous M15! My first photo of globular clusters. Thanks to the dark skies - it is possible to see IFN on this shot!!!\r\n\r\nI hope you will like it. Looking forward to your feedback! Thanks!",
