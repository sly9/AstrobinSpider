    "description": "I am Sorry for showing another Eta Carina, but this one is special, first of all it was shot with SGP fully auto... SGP was in charge of centering, focusing each filter and flipping the mount half way in to the integration time....\r\nAlso made possible by the New Moonlite focuser that lets me autofocus with SGP...\r\nThis test also solves a BIG problem i had with my photos, MY NARROWBAND FILTERS WHERE UPSIDE DOWN... the AR side of the filters where pointing to the telescope, allowing a glare from the sensor window to show up on the subs as a weird gradient not possible to calibrate with flats or process out easily. now the subs are totally clean after the calibration...\r\nThis image has Darks and Bias subtracted, no flats...\r\nHa, Oiii and Sii 10 x 120 seconds each filter.\r\nI now have to keep working on my guiding, as you can see, star shapes are still weird.....\r\nSo far, the difference when processing is HUGE.... hope you like it.",
