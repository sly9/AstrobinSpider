    "description": "Data Acquisition from 2019-11-24 until 2021-01-17\r\nDSO Color Mapping: Stars RGB, Nebulae Modified Hubble Palette\r\nOriginal Image Scale: 4.00\r\nNote: This scope is located at Sierra Remote Observatory. I personally configured and installed this scope and make regular trips to SRO to perform maintenance and upgrades. When not on site, I operate the scope nightly from home using a remote desktop application.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is a dynamic looking region of the constellation Auriga where spherical nebulas appear to be shot toward each other. The image includes the nebulae Sh2-232, Sh2-235, Sh2-231, Sh2-234 and LBN 796, among others, and the open star clusters M38 and M36. \r\n\r\nThe eyeball looking nebula (Sh2-232) has been mistaken for a planetary nebula, but none of the round or semi-spherical objects in this field of view are actually classified as PNs (per Galaxy Map and SIMBAD). In fact, the big fuzzy ball in the lower left center (right above cluster M36) does not seem to have any designation at all and is merely a part of the greater nebula LBN 796. \r\n\r\nA 2012 paper suggests that these unusual forms are all part of an expanding shell, the result of an ancient supernova. In turn, this shell exists within a larger molecular cloud. which is located 1800 pc from Earth. By comparison the two clusters are much closer, of course: M36 (bottom center) is 1330 pc distant, and M38 (center right) lies only 1066 pc away.",
