    "description": "I captured this data set about a year ago when I was trying out a GSO 12\" Newt. I wasn't really happy with my original processing, as I had a lot of light pollution issues with such a big mirror based telescope 15 minutes outside of Detroit. I reprocessed the data with some of may newer techniques and am much happier with it. \r\n\r\nThis small Sharpless object sits high in the northern fall sky north of SH2-171, which is a common object imaged and south of Abell 85; a supernova remnant. Often called the small rosette due to its resemblance to the original, this small Sharpless object is five times smaller in size and much less bright than the Rosette Nebula; therefore it is not a common imaged target.",
