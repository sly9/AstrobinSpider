    "description": "This was a real ghost! After three nights fighting with the moon, ice on the camera sensor cover glass and other technical problems, I got at least enough data to process it. Also I had to shoot with gain 100 in RGB, which is rather uncommon, but the signal was so faint due to light pollution, since other wise nothing would have been visible. My location is definitely not the best place for dark nebula. But if you never try, you will never find out...\r\n \r\nSince this is my very first try to go for a dark nebula I have noticed how hard it is to achieve a decent result. The raw data is definitely by far better than the actual result, but I am still figuring out the right approach.\r\nMaybe I get the chance to add some data in a later session, but the whether forecast is less optimistic.",
