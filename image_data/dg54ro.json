    "description": "Barnard 22 and the nested reflection nebula IC 2087 are both part of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. IC 2087 resembles the shape of a small core of flame, seemingly lighting up the darker surroundings. This is an area with rich features, a lot is going on despite of the \"darkness\"; I love the dynamicity it brings visually. \r\n\r\nI found it tricky to bring out the details & contrast of the main body while maintaining a reasonably dark background. I also saw different verions of color tones and I aimed for a orange-ish \"burning tone\" for this one. Also, I seem to noticed a few interesting small feature during processing, and I believe I identified them correctly in the annotated version.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/search/?q=TeamNoctuaDSNM&subject=&telescope=&camera=&date_published_min=2011-11-09&date_published_max=2099-05-10\"><I>#TeamNoctuaDSNM</I></ a>",
