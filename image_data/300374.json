    "description": "Sharpless 216 is a huge and dim planetary nebula, the bubble at right in this picture. Sharpless 221 is an ancient Supernova remnant, even dimmer at left, typically built up of lots of filaments. Both are glowing at Hydrogen and Oxygen lines, and their distinctly different appearance make for a great motiv. The intense red blob north of 221 is Sh2-217 and the smaller one next to 221 is Sh2-219. Between the two majors here sits another medium size H-Alpha region without Sharpless number, dubbed BFS44, that contains a dark nebula called B25. The whole region is very near to bright Capella, which resides just left of the field.\r\n\r\nLots of numbers, but nothing in the mouseover :-)\r\n\r\n17+8+13+9 LRGB each 8min subs and 37x15min Ha and 17x15min OIII\r\nSigma 180 Macro at f/2,8\r\nAstrel 8300 mono controlled by a Android tablet, \r\nAstronomik L2/RGB Deepsky/Ha12nm/OIII12nm.",
