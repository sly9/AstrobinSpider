    "description": "The Bubble nebula is a 7 light year wide emission nebula ionized by a central O-type Star. Thousands if not hundreds of thousands times brighter than our own sun. This is a violently active region in Cassiopeia and it lies nearly 7000 light years away.\r\n\r\nRepresented here is another SHO rendition but in a more HOO style pallet! I think I ultimately like the true Hubble palette version.. I‚Äôve made some changes to that version üòÇ It‚Äôs honestly always pretty hard for me to decide on a final color tone. I‚Äôm just thankful to have clear skies.\r\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\r\nCem60\r\n10‚Äù f/3.9\r\nASI183mm\r\nAstrodon SHO\r\nZWO accessories",
