    "description": "Cave Nebula, a beautiful nebula in Cepheus. About 2,400 light-years away along the Milky Way. Studies reveal that the nebula has formed on the border of the Cepheus B molecular cloud and the young, hot, blue stars of the Cepheus OB 3 association. The bright edge of ionized hydrogen gas feeds on radiation from hot stars , especially of the blue star of type O that is seen on the center of the image. These radiation-driven ionization fronts are causing the nuclei to collapse and the formation of new stars within them. The cosmic cave is more than 10 light-years in diameter, an appropriate size for a good batch of new stars. \r\nAcquisition data:\r\n Telescope: Takahashi FSQ106 F5\r\n Mount: Paramount ME \r\nCCD: Atik 460 EX MONO \r\nGuided: Lodestar X2 + EZG60 \r\nObservatory: UriarteRuiz in Àger (name to be baptized) \r\nPlace: Àger (La Noguera)\r\nDates: 24, 25 and 26 August 2020 \r\nFilters LRGBHa Astrodon L 25 x 600 \"R 25 x 300\" G 25 x 300 \"B 40 x 300\" H 45 x 900 \"Total: 22.9h of exposure.
