    "description": "The subject of this image, taken at a wavelength of 715nm by Schott RG-715 long-pass filter, is the lunar crater “Tycho”, one of the most famous impact craters visible on the Moon, whose rays are due to the violent powerful impact, it is even visible from Earth to the naked eye. To see the actual crater, you need at least a small binocular to return some magnification (typically at least 5x or more) compared to the ocular vision without any optical instrument.\r\n\r\nTycho is a crater with a diameter of about 85km and an estimated age of about 108 million years. The asteroid from which the crater was generated must have been almost as big as the one that caused the extinction of the Dinosaurs, about 65 million years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the image, which is oriented with the South at the top and has a resolution about of below the Km, you can see (from left to bottom, clockwise) the craters: Orontius (partial), Pictet, Street, Longomontanus (the one in the shade, at the extreme edge at the top right, on which the Sun is rising), besides obviously the Tycho crater exactly at the center of the image.",
