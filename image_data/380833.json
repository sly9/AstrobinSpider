    "description": "NGC 2336 is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Camelopardalis. It is located at a distance of about 100 million light years from Earth.  It has an apparent size of 7 arc minutes and a magnitude of 10.3.  In spite of these measurements my initial exposures showed a smallish and fairlly faint image.  The object had such an interesting symmetrical face-on appearance, however, that I decided to see if I could get a detailed image on it.  I had a few exposures from 2016 to start, but most of the data came from 2018.\r\n \r\nDate: Nov 2016, Nov-Dec 2018\r\nLocation: Blue Mountain Vista Observatories,New Ringgold PA\r\n\r\nOptics: Celestron EdgeHD 1100 on Paramount MX\r\nCamera: Sbig STL-11000 for RGB\r\n\r\nOptics: Starizona Hyperion f/8 12.5 inch, FL 2540 mm on Paramount ME\r\nCamera: Apogee U8300 for Lum\r\n\r\nGuiding: ST-402 on Innovations Foresight On-Axis Guider and STL-11000 Self guiding\r\n\r\nExposure: LRGB: L:86x10 R:25x9.5 min, G:24x9.3 min, B:28x9.5 min for a total of 26.5 hrs (163 subs at avg of 584 sec) \r\nProcessing: Image acquisition using CCD Autopilot.
