    "description": "This is my favorite nigtscape photo of the Milky Way. Our sky conditions are not so good. Only a few days have a clear sky. I used astrophoto postprocess techniques in this image, but I keep the \"reality\" of the landscape and the sky. This is NOT a composite photo. This is a panoramic image. (5 single frames). The \"stars\" are real (I use 6starfilter).",
