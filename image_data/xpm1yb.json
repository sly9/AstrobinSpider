    "description": "This glorious emission nebula also comprises dark nebula LDN 1594 and Barnard 35, with LBN 879 as a bright yellow nebula punching through the darker dust.  To me it resembles a longbow however I don't know if it has a colloquial name of any sort.\r\n\r\nIt is a two panel mosaic and it has sat on my PC for some weeks as I slowly caught up on processing and kept revisiting.  I have been trying various techniques of combining Ha data into RGB, experimenting with PI's scripts and also PixelMath expressions: I have not settled on anyone technique and it seems to me at the moment that non are very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI first saw this target when imaged by Jim Thomas (http://jthommes.com/Astro/LBN878.htm) - a great image and inspiration, thank you Jim.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
