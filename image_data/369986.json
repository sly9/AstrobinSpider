    "description": "Finally I could image the Crescent with the CCD camera. The nebula was one of my first targets with the DSLR and I was always fascinated by the OIII areas, which seem to enclose the whole nebula. The 10 inch Newtonian is also more and more a pleasure for me - the resolution gain compared to the 8 inch is very clear. :-)",
