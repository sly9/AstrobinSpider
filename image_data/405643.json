    "description": "High res mosaic made on April 11th. added color data to it from April 13th. Layering both images well over eachother was not a straightforward task and a tremendous effort. But well worth the effort.\r\n\r\nThis image won first prize on imaging challenge 23 of Stargazer's lounge. \r\n\r\nI hope you all enjoy loking at it as much as I enjoyed making the picture.",
