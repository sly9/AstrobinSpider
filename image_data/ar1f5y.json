    "description": "KUV 18217+6419 is a bright quasar in Draco and is one of the brightest objects of its class. This stellar object was discovered in 1977 as an X-ray source by the HEAO1 satellite. The host galaxy of quasar KUV 18217+6419 is a giant elliptical galaxy, also classified as a Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxy (HyLIRG). The quasar host resides at the centre of galaxy cluster CL 1821+643\r\nQuasar KUV 18217+6419 is located only 1Â´SE of planetary nebula PK 94+27.1 (= K1-16), which can only be observed with large aperture telescopes under very dark skies. The bluish central star is a lot easier to detect at v=15.04\r\nsource http://quasar.square7.ch/",
