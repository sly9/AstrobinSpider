    "description": "A zoom of my last M106 :\r\nSee full field here : <a href=\"https://astrob.in/397602/0/\">M106 - Spiral galaxy and friends</a>\r\n\r\nMy try with M106 , a beautiful and large galaxy with LRGB and Halpha subs to enhanced the core with its filaments. You can also see small spiral galaxies around : NGC3231, 4231 , and 4226 and a larger one like a yellow UFO : NGC4217 !\r\n\r\nWiki : It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781. M106 is at a distance of about 22 to 25 million light-years away from Earth. M106 contains an active nucleus classified as a Type 2 Seyfert, and the presence of a central supermassive black hole has been demonstrated from radio-wavelength observations of the rotation of a disk of molecular gas orbiting within the inner light-year around the black hole\r\n\r\nFor the Light , I selected around 30% of the best Fwhm subs and combined them with all the subs to get sharper details and smaller stars\r\n5 Nights were necessary to get the subs: 13,14, 15, 16 and 24 of February\r\n\r\nRed 30 subs@180s -20°C gain 139\r\nBlue 30 subs@180s -20°C gain 139\r\nGreen 38 subs@180s -20°C gain 139\r\n\r\nLight 113 subs@180s -20°C, gain 139 and zero\r\nHalpha 96 subs@180s -20°C gain 139\r\n\r\nTell me what you think ?",
