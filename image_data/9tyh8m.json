    "description": "Few months ago while entering the world of astrophotography I was searching for the best equipment in my budget and came through a Astronomik Ha filter for half the price and got it.\r\nRight now I have a stock unmodified dslr and I knew that it will be nearly impossible to get sufficient ha data using a stock Canon 80D and a Ha/oiii filters.\r\nSo i clipped the filter on my Star Adventurer in a bortle 6 sky and took nearly 5 hours of data, and I was blown away by amount of data captured although having a stock dslr!\r\n\r\nHere you can see the beautiful Butterfly Nebula and crescent Nebula in their colorful outfit!\r\nSo yea it came out pretty awesome\r\nMany more coming on the way\r\n\r\nthis was shot using a stock canon 80D",
