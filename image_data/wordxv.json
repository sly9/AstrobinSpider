    "description": "After a long time I resumed using my old refractor and I was wondering if the details it gaves me when I took the Orion Nebula could also have been given to me when shooting these beautiful nebulae. Fortunately my doubts were unfounded and there are so many details in my picture. Shooting with  h alpha lrgb was hampered by a June with variable weather and in July I had an incredible number of problems on my equipment that made me lose many precious hours of shooting, luckily the object being shot is very bright and with about  7  hours of shooting for each panel, most of which devoted to 30 minute photos taken with the h alpha filter, I still managed to achieve this result.  To make   this photo I  did  a mosaic of 2 panels.",
