    "description": "This is my RBG data from rural Sweden with a Canon 60Da and a 5\" ES apo refractor (22 x 480\") and Ole Alexander Ødegård´s Ha data (18x600\") from rural Norway with his mono modded Canon 6D and a 12\" TS imaging Newton, so nearly 6 hours total. I could probably have been a bit softer in the processing but it is also nice with a bit of drama in the picture. I have been starring on it enough now and would like to hear what you think, so any comments are welcome!",
