    "description": "Wait for it ....\r\n\r\nThis animated image shows the wonderful scene that unfolded before me in Iceland a few weeks ago.    It is a larger image file and may need some time to download and smooth out.   I rocked the animation back and forth so it is easier to watch the features change with time.  \r\n\r\nI found it pretty interesting how much the appearance changed in this sequence which spanned only 22 minutes.   It started out with very defined ribbons and spires, but quickly developed in to a very diffuse cloud-like structure.  In fact I could visibly see the patches pulsing in an out of view like popcorn.   This was happening about every second or two, so the 8 second exposures only show part of this.   \r\n\r\nI described the scene in a previous still image here:\r\n<a href=\"http://astrob.in/310564/0/\"><img src=\"http://astrob.in/310564/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg\"/></a>\r\nIn this shot, a lone car seen is driving down the Ring Road toward Jökulsárlón glacial lagoon around the bend.    \r\n\r\nIt is downsized to ~20% the original capture resolution and limited to a 256 color GIF so some unavoidable artifacting is present.   \r\n\r\nEnjoy!!",
