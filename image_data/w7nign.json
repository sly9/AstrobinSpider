    "description": "Finally a new image... This one is been acquired in 2016 duraing an astrocamp in a very nice and dark location in Italy. I've never considered as a good candidate for any editing purposes simply 'cos I've got just TWO exposures of 15min each, one in H-Alpha light and the other in OIII. I've never supposed that ther's enough signal nor SNR for a good result. In this very sad days of pandemy I've opened the frames just for fun realizing that ther's a very good amount of data and I've give it a chance. I've managed to include also some RGB datas, mainly for the stars an little bit for the nebula too that I've acquired also during the years. The resulting image is a surprise to me!\r\nAnyway this is my version of the Lagoon nebula in HII and OIII + some RGB for stars and nebula too. Total integration time is about 30min total for narrowband at 5nm + about 1.5 hours for straight RGB. Everything acquired through a Takahashi Epsilon 210 telescope and a QSI 683 WSG8 camera with Astrodon gen II filters.\r\n\r\nThanks",
