    "description": "Orion and the Milky Way at 29mm, f3.2.  slight crop and 0.6x scale version here.  First trip out with the Sky guider Pro.  Looking forward to another if I can get back to some dark skies!\r\n\r\nI have not done much wide field processing and I've been struggling with the two wide field Orion images I'm working on.  One at 29mm and one at 70mm.  Perhaps I'm just pushing that data too hard for this zoom lens with only 90sec exposures, but I really wanted to pull out some of the dark, reflection and emission nebulas in the Orion Molecular Complex. \r\n\r\nI keep adjusting both of these images every time I walk away and come back but can't tell if they are getting better anymore so I thought I'd finally just post a version! Any feedback welcome.",
