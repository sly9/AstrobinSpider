    "description": "There have been some amazing images of IC443 posted lately one being https://www.astrobin.com/gmjvl4/     It's one of my favorite nebulas at the moment and I am incredibly intrigued by it.  I decided to grab more data and have a go at it again.   I kept it purely broadband RGB with my OSC.  I absolutely love this in SHO, but will wait till I get a mono camera.  That being said I'm really happy with the star color and nebulosity color in this image .  Comparing to my October version my processing has improved.   Hope you enjoy.  stay safe and clear skies to all.",
