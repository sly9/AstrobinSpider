    "description": "Astronomers think that the unusual shape of the Cartwheel Galaxy may be due to a previous massive collision with a smaller galaxy, such as those seen to the right of the galaxy here, which apparently crashed right through it. The shock wave produced pushed the gas and dust material outward like when a stone falls into a pool of water resulting in the cartwheel-like shape\r\n\r\nThe recent star burst activity—a star-forming activity due to massive gas compression waves—has lit up the Cartwheel's outer rim, which has a diameter 1.5 times the size of our own Milky Way galaxy. \r\n\r\nThe creation of stars by starburst galaxies, such as the Cartwheel Galaxy, results in the formation of large and extremely luminous stars like the ones seen on the left side of the rim.
