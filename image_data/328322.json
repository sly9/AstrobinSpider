    "description": "Looks as if a star field picture with wide field DSLR lens, but actually it is an enlarged shot of a part of the Large Magellanic Cloud with the D=500mm, fl=1,900mm reflector at <a href=\"http://www.chilescope.com\">Chilescope</a>.   Shapes of the diffuse and reflection nebulae are exisotic, especially for people in the northern hemisphere like me, and colors of the stars are exceptionally beautiful there.",
