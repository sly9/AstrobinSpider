    "description": "Revisiting the Rosette with narrowband over the last 3 weeks. FOV is more restricted than it was with my dslr on the ES102, but I think I got some of the more interesting bits, and I'm happy with the results. I could have used a bit more SII in the image, to get some of the wispy stuff around the cluster, but the clouds rolled in for the remainder of the weekend.",
