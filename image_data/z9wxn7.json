    "description": "This photo was taken at Tibbettâ€™s Point Lighthouse in New York State at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. All of the conditions lined up perfectly to allow me to capture this image. I began shooting the foreground around 11:30 PM while the moon was still high in the sky and was lighting up the side of the lighthouse very beautifully. My foreground is a stack of 10 exposures, 30s each. I then waited for the moon to set, and shot the sky between 2:15 and 2:30 AM (The camera and tripod were not moved between taking the foreground and sky shots). The sky is a stack of 20 exposures, 15s each along with 50 dark frames. This night there were completely clear skies, temps around 45 degrees F, low humidity, and average transparency, which all helped lead to a super clean sky image, and just enough haze for the light house to cast dramatic shadows and rays in the air.",
