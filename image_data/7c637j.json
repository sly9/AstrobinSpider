    "description": "NGC 3521 - The so-called \"Bubble galaxy\" is a spiral galaxy about 50,000 light years in diameter, located just 26.2 million light years from Earth in the constellation Leo (Leo), while that it moves away from us at about 801 kilometers per second. .\r\n\r\nThe galaxy has a morphological classification of SAB (rs) bc, which indicates that it is a spiral galaxy with a trace of bar structure (SAB), a weak internal ring (rs) and an arm structure. . moderately to weakly wound (bc).\r\n\r\nThe multiple spiral arms of the NGC 3521 are somewhat uneven and irregular, making it a so-called flocculent spiral galaxy. These galaxies have discontinuous \"fluffy\" spiral arms that differ from the well-defined arms of large-design spiral galaxies. About 30 percent of all spiral galaxies discovered to date are flocculent.\r\n\r\nThe image reveals evidence of one or more previous fusions with dwarf galaxies that left discernible substructures, like an almost spherical cloud of debris visible almost all around. This represents shells of debris belonging to an umbrella-like structure.",
