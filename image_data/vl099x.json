    "description": "I know that there still few weeks of good visibility of Mars - but taking under consideration that weather in Poland is very awfull and I'm totally out of time last days - I decided to make my season summory now :)\r\n\r\nSe here it is - 6 months of red planet photography - in May & Juny at very low altitude and at \"inhuman\" hour - around 4-5 am\r\nThen in July and August in better conditions. In September with exceptional seeing during almost all of the month (which is really rare here in Poland). And in October/November with poor conditions and trying to catch some \"holes in the clouds\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, it was my best Mars season - and here is the picture with my best frames from that  time :)",
