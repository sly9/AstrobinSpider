    "description": "Have been sitting on this one for a while, mainly because I was never expecting the end result to look so interesting! Finally buckled down though and cranked through it. What a pleasant surprise at the end, a much more dynamic area than I had initially believed. The sharpness of the dust within the nebula was a welcomed surprise along with the expansive background nebulosity. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking, RGB version to come eventually :)",
