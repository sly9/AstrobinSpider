    "description": "Taken with Tom O'Donghue at the astronopmy gite Les Granges.\r\nThe idea was to find out the limits of the extended Ha nebulosity which we suspected far beyond IC59 and 63 near Gamma Cass. We then wondered if there might be a physical connection with the Pacman but maybe there isn't.\r\nThe name 'Breaking Wave' seemed appropriate!",
