    "description": "This is a panorama from the lunar south to the last quarter, obtained from three panels.\r\nI deliberately reversed the image of 180 degrees in order to be able to better appreciate on the horizon the different reliefs, observable thanks to the phenomenon of libration, and which detach themselves in the celestial darkness.\r\nAt the top right, you can distinguish the crater Hausen, a circus with central mountains (167 km), with its terraced enclosure. Continuing on the left, the Leibnitz mountains, then following Drygalski Crater (163 km).\r\nTwo other courses are worth looking at:\r\n- The largest closed plain of the visible face, Bailly (303 km). A very rugged arena, dotted with multiple craters, visible here under the crater Hausen.\r\n- At the bottom right, the Schiller crater, curiously elongated (175x71 km) with contours reminiscent of the shape of a shoe. It is the result of a complicated evolution, and represents the most unusual specimen.\r\nOn the left of the image, the shaving light gives the craters that gradually plunge into the night a ghostly appearance.",
