    "description": "These were tough little images to capture. Nothing like a 102/F11 refractor in 20+MPH wind gusts.     \r\n\r\nSeeing 2, Transparency 4/5\r\n\r\nI really like my CHEAP 102/F11 achromat for solar imaging.  Its my best corrected scope for Calcium and Ha.  I used my Lunt 100 front mounted DS filter (circa 2012).   \r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to try their hand at processing here is the link to the master. If published please mention me :)\r\n\r\nI processed in ImPPG for sharpening and tone curves (I inverted the image in ImPPG and adjusted the tone curves)\r\nPS\r\n-Crop\r\n-convert to RGB\r\n-High pass (4 px) set at 60%\r\n-High pass (30 px) set at 50% for contrast\r\n-Curves for color \r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/t/XCvuckpHiQa56AIX\r\n\r\nAlan",
