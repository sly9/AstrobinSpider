    "description": "Unofficially known as the Fossil Footprint Nebula, I was not able to find much information on this particular target. Surprisingly there aren't that many images of it floating around either, despite it being a pretty prominent nebula in Perseus. It has a very bright core relative to the surrounding dust and gasses, which presents some challenges during processing. \r\n\r\nI threw a decent amount of  integration time at this target, and it looks like I still could have used more. It was hard to keep the noise under control while trying to bring out some of the faint detail. SII was extremely weak except for the edges of the core, and I could have easily doubled the total integration time. As usual, a compromise had to be struck. The result is a little more grain in the nebula than I'd like to have. But, considering it is a relatively challenging target I'm happy with the result.",
