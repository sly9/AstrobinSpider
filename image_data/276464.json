    "description": "I originally intended to make this a 1.5h integration. The total imaging time for this capture actually sums 2h. ?????  What happened? Clouds =D! I lost many frames in it because of them, and the ramaining 11 best were stacked, and the result is presented here. Not the cleanest and not as good as I intended to be, but, given the conditions, the result turned out to be quite suprising to me. What do you think?\r\n\r\n*Please check the full image 2400px - resized from original)*\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, comments and suggestions are more than welcome in the comments section. Thank's for taking your time to look at this image.\r\n\r\nTaken from Rural Skies (Bortle 3-4; NELM ~6.2; SQM ~21.6*calculated), from Cristina, MG, Brazil (22ºS latitude).\r\n\r\nDate and Time: July 5th, 2016, at 20:30h (UTC-3, start of capture)\r\nCamera: Unmodded Canon T4i/650D, at ISO 800\r\nLens: Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8, at 70mm, operated at f/3.5\r\nMount: Sky-Watcher HEQ5, tracking, controlled with EQASCOM, unguided\r\nExposure Detail: 11x240s (total 44min)",
