    "description": "* Image acquisition by: Las Cumbres Observatory.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* Distance: 55 Mly.\r\n\r\nNGC 2997 is a face-on unbarred spiral galaxy about 55 million light-years away in the constellation Antlia. It is the brightest galaxy of the NGC 2997 group of galaxies.\r\n\r\nIts small nucleus and sprawling spiral arms give it a type \"Sc\" designation. Is thought to have a mass of about 100 billion times that of our Sun.\r\n\r\nNGC 2997 is particularly notable for a nucleus surrounded by a chain of hot giant clouds of ionized hydrogen.",
