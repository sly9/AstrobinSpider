    "description": "The star Sadr in the middle of cygnus is a bright star easy visible. What you can not see is the stunning nebulosity around Sadr, which I want to make visible with this pic. Challenging is to get the brightness of Sadr under control without loosing its dominance. For star colors and because I do not like purple stars, I added some RGB frames. Not a difficult target, but a nice one I think.",
