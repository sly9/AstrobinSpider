    "description": "I have always struggled with good data and processing for this target, so have put some extra effort in this time.  Have chosen to leave the colours pale, rather than cranking up the Ha across the image field.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia: Considering its distance of about 160,000 light-years, the Tarantula Nebula is an extremely luminous non-stellar object. Its luminosity is so great that if it were as close to Earth as the Orion Nebula, it would cast daytime shadows. In fact it is the most active starburst region known in the Local Group of galaxies. The nebula resides on the leading edge of the LMC where ram pressure stripping, and the compression of the interstellar medium likely resulting from this, is at a maximum.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
