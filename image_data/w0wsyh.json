    "description": "This image made from 3 panels allows to visualize the famous fault Rupes Recta (100 km) in the center of a region rich in large craters such as Arzachel at the top and left of this view, with its interior slopes in terraces and its arena traversed by a groove of about 50 km.\r\nBelow Arzachel, the well-designed crater Alpetragius is amazing with its imposing central massif.\r\nParallel to Rupes Recta, the thin Rima Birt groove (50 km) is particularly visible.\r\nTo the south of these reliefs lies a darker area, Mare Nubium.",
