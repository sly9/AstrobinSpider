    "description": "Thank  you Andreas and Frank for your tip. I have done a complete new processing of the NGC 1499 data. It was my first try to combine the Lum and Ha data to use it as the Luminance layer. I think that was a good choice. Now I am more happy with the result of the California Nebula. Hope you like it too.\r\nI wish you all a happy new year... stay well and CS Harry.",
