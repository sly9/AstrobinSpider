    "description": "ETHOS 1 (PN G068.1 + 11.0) is a bipolar planetary nebula in the constellation Lyra.\r\nThe planetary nebula ETHOS 1 (PN G068.1 + 11.0) was discovered by an international team of astronomers on December 15, 2010.\r\nThe discovery of the planetary nebula ETHOS 1 first case in the framework of the project ETHOS - Extremely Turquoise Halo Object Survey. The central star in the planetary nebula ETHOS 1 is double. The distance between the components is about 2 million kilometers. The circulation period is 0.53512 days or 12.84 hours. The amplitude is 0.816 m. The most massive of these stars is at the end of its evolution. Nebulae gas streams expanding in different directions moving at a speed of 120 km/s. The age of the nebula is estimated at 900 (900 ± 100) years for a spherical corolla and 1800 (1750 ± 250) years for gas jets. Thus, the ETHOS 1 gas double emission is twice the age of the nebula's spherical halo. Scientists have yet to understand the cause of this phenomenon.\r\nThe appearance of the nebula reminds me of a propeller. The angular size of the spherical part - 19.4\", with jets - 62.6\".",
