    "description": "Sunflower galaxy is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation of hound, with an apparent magnitude of 8.5 and about 29.5 million light-years away from the sun. Sunflower galaxy is one of the brighter spiral galaxies in the night sky, which can be observed with a small telescope. In the above image of M63, you can see the slender curved arms of bright young stars with blue glow, emission nebulae with red glow due to free hydrogen, and numerous dark dust belts.",
