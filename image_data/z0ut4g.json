    "description": "Hi everybody and happy new year !\r\n\r\nI share this image taken by my friend Philippe Lamothe from his backyard observatory in Calvados (RC 14\"). Data taken with a G2-400 (18 x 5mn) and ASI 294 MC Pro (40 x 5mn). It was very interesting for me to process it, as there were no flats, leading to a hard vignetting and many donuts.\r\n\r\nAfter gradien removal with IRIS, I made a synthetic background and mixed it using masks in photoshop. Version B is on of them for example. I lost some faint signal, but the final result looks OK.\r\n\r\nJF",
