    "description": "To be perfectly honest, one of the aspects that drew me into astronomy and astrophotography was the realization that I had an opportunity to explore a vast unknown. I never could have fathomed, starting out, that I could set my telescope out in my backyard and see close to the observable edges of time and space. No other generation of humans had this ability, and the perspectives I can share here are, quite literally, the frontiers of our age. These realms contain the infinite questions about who we are, how we fit in the cosmos, and what our future may hold.\r\n\r\nIâ€™d like you to stop for a moment and look at this image. The colorful stars in our home galaxy may be the first thing you notice, but that yellow cluster in the center? Not stars. These are all galaxies, hundreds visible here in total.\r\n\r\nThough barely detectable with a backyard hobby telescope, this image clearly shows gravitationally lensed galaxies floating out in space.  Some of these are over 11 billion light years away. This is the furthest extended object I have ever captured. This is a deep field image, indeed. Those individual colorful Milky Way stars are 10 million times closer to the camera!\r\n\r\nNow sit back and .... and ponder your place in it all. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
