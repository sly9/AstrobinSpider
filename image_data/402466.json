    "description": "Saturn on the morning of Easter Sunday AEST.\r\n\r\nWinJUPOS composite of nine 130s stacks between 4:16 and 4:36 am Canberra time.\r\n\r\nSeeing was quite good for the first half of this capture (10min), this is were majority of useful frames originate from.  Happy to get a hint of North Polar Hexagon with the colour Skyris, it's always challenging to achieve subtle detail and differentiation between the bands without filters.\r\n\r\nTried to reach fine balance in regards to noise, there may be a white storm within a northern NEB (3 and 9 o'clock, just passed CM) and dark spots within NPR.. all borderline though. Encke Gap and B ring detail is much more obvious.",
