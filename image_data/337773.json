    "description": "This image was assembled and processed by me by downloading the publicly available original calibrated data from the MAST archive - https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/m82/\r\n\r\nThis 2006 Hubble Space Telescope image provides a wonderful view of this very interesting galaxy. Also known by the designation NGC 3034, this unusual galaxy is approximately 12 million light years distant.\r\n\r\nMessier 82 was first described by Johann Bode in 1774 as a \"nebulous patch\" near its companion galaxy, Messier 81. Charles Messier added this object to his famous catalog in 1779.\r\n\r\nMessier 82 has been classified by astronomers as a \"starburst galaxy\" which is making new stars at a rate 10 times faster than our own Milky Way Galaxy. Messier 82 is also five times brighter than the Milky Way. Astronomers also believe that the flame-like red plumes of glowing hydrogen gas seen above and below the center of Messier 82 are caused by the intense star formation activity at the center of this galaxy.\r\n\r\nAdditional information on Messier 82 can be found on the Hubble Space Telescope site - http://hubblesite.org/image/1876/news_release/2006-14\r\n\r\nCamera: Hubble ACS/WFC - original data set acquired on March 27, 2006\r\n\r\nFilters Used: F658N, F555W, and F435W\r\n\r\nColor Assignments: red - F658N, green - F555W, and blue - F435W",
