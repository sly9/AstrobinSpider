    "description": "Mosaic of planetary nebulas photographs made in 2018\r\nAlso I attached size description of each of it.\r\nSize is based of photo measure and some external sources so it may vary a little if you will check with your astro programs, but anyway it's more or less ok.\r\n\r\nStar background is randomized :)\r\n\r\nAll photos made with the same setup and I'm presenting it with setup native scale - 0,41''/pix\r\nOf course exposition is different for each nebula - you can find details in my astrobin gallery where I'm presenting each of this object separatley.\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n\r\nSW Newtonian 250/1200 + ASI 178 MM-C camera\r\nBaader LRGB filters\r\nComa Corrector Baader MPCC Mark III",
