    "description": "The North America nebula is one of the largest emission nebulae in the sky, located in the constellation of Cygnus (the Swan).  This image covers the equivalent area of 36 full moons.   The image is a complex scene with objects that are at various distances from us.  The large bright foreground Milky Way stars are closest.  Next at about 1500 light years is the dark molecular cloud which lies in front of the emission nebula, blocks off portions of the glow, and defines the \"North America\" shape.  Next is the emission nebula itself at about 2000 light years.   Finally, the open star cluster NGC 6997 in the upper right of the image has been determined to be beyond the nebulous cloud by about 200 light years, dimming the cluster brightness somewhat.  Note how the star density varies widely across the image as a function of the heavy dust in some areas of the nebula.  \r\n\r\nThe most striking feature of the narrowband (SII/Ha/OIII) image  is the prominent emission towards the bottom known as the Cygnus Wall.  The wall has been sculpted by radiation from the region's young, hot, massive stars and is an area of active star formation.",
