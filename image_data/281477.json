    "description": "Following in the footsteps of my noble friend Almir Germano, follows my first Jupiter Gif this season.\r\n9 shots were taken as the first test, each shot with 10,000 frames, with 3,000 stacks being stacked, post-processing in Registax, Photofiltre and Fitswork exactly the same, even though the differences in seeing are reflected from film to film.\r\nEach capture lasted exactly 60 sec with a pause also if 60 sec.\r\nI concluded that the 60 sec interval between filming is a bit long which prevents the feeling of continuous motion. I have one more Gif to complete using the same parameters, but in the next, I will reduce the interval to 30 sec pause with 60 sec footage to see if I get a more natural movement.",
