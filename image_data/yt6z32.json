    "description": "I have to admit that HaLRGB processing is something that I just don't feel like I have the best understanding of or process for.  I have made a few attempts at different methodologies with varying degrees of success.  This time I reached out to Adam Block for a bit of consulting.  I attempted to take his advice and direction and apply it to this terrific data from Deep Sky West in Rowe, NM.\r\n\r\nWhat I struggle with is getting the Ha to come through without messing up the stars or losing the red data that isn't from the emission line.  I think I have managed (with Adams help) to preserve the proper star color, but I am still a bit unhappy with the color of the dust in the dust lane.  The Ha is so strong that it overpowers the rest of the red channel.  Perhaps I should keep at it...\r\n\r\nThank you, Adam, for helping me to get to this result.\r\nAs always, C and C are welcome and appreciated.",
