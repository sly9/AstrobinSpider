    "description": "NGC 3184 is a large spiral galaxy with a small nucleus and long sprawling spiral arms. Although NGC 3184 contains hundreds of billions of stars, the blue color of its spiral arms comes mostly from relatively few bright young blue stars. The galaxy is not empty of matter between these spiral arms -- the bright stars that highlight the arms were created in huge density waves that circle the center. NGC 3184 is a spiral galaxy approximately 25 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It has two HII region named NGC 3180 and NGC 3181. NGC 3184 is notable for its high abundance of heavy elements and a supernova (SN 1999gi) that had occurred there in 1999.\r\n\r\nRC8 + CCDT67 + AtikOne\r\n\r\nHa: 15min x 36\r\nLum: 5min x 178\r\nRed: 5min x 36\r\nGreen: 5min x 31\r\nBlue: 5min x 47\r\n\r\nDrizzle integration was used in post-processing.\r\n\r\nLum:",
