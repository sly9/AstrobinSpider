    "description": "As newby astrophotographer, this is my first time photographing the Eagle Nebula. I did it in parallel on the nights I photographed the Tadpoles & Spider nebula. (https://www.astrobin.com/dt8d7b/?nc=user)\r\nThe Tadpoles & Spider nebula was in the sky from 20:30 to 23:30, so in the morning from 02:00 to 06:00 I photographed the Eagle nebula.\r\nIt is very low on the horizon at this time but finally after 28 hours of exposure I think I was able to capture a lot of detail (considering my small telescope)\r\nThanks for visiting!",
