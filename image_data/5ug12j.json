    "description": "Here is the H-alpha capture of the solar disk showing the active area AR12741 with his main spot, as it could be seen on May 14, 2019. At that time, AR12741 was a  Beta-gamma region already decaying, with the light bridge that appeared a couple of days ago but on May 11,  truly severing the sunspot into two distinct umbrae with a unipolar field. AR12741 was trailing some mixed fields and a few small pores that still appeared likely to lead to reconnections. The main spot has developed a light bridge which may signal that it has also come to its decay phase.\r\nThe capture is processed using the inverted mono image and false color as close to the chromatic colors specific to the H-alpha frequency. Plasma dynamics impose to shot at a high speed, so I can latter stack many frames and assure a clear, final image. It is very hard to imagine the plasma shapes because it is not solid and yet the image perfectly blends harmoniously the diffuse areas where the details are accentuated.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH, Eric, for collaboration!\r\n\r\nTelescope: Detlef Schmidt custom-made folded refractor.\r\nMount: Astro-Physics 1100 GTO.\r\nCamera: GS3-PGE-23S6M-C: 2.3 MP, 48 FPS, with SONY IMX174.\r\nThe H-alpha filter:  DayStar University 0.6 Angstrom.\r\n\r\nSoftware:\r\nAdobe Photoshop CS6\r\nAstroart\r\nIMPPG\r\nAutoStakkert 3",
