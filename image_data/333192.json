    "description": "And there they finally were - the first starry nights of the year 2018. :-) As I had already announced in the H-Alpha Version of this image, I wanted to add some more exposure time for M1. Unfortunately the weather conditions changed again, so there was no sufficient time for recordings with the OIII filter. But I think I also managed it to get a good composition with the H-Alpha and SII recordings. I supplemented the star colours with older image data collected with my DSLR at the same scope. Hope you enjoy it! :-)",
