    "description": "Another target with a story behind it - shot the Horsehead and Flame nebula, but one of the nights, the rotator lost its zero position and I ended up with plenty of subs that are rotated at different angles. The resulting integrated image was not up to snuff, so here is a cropped Horsehead Nebula. I will get the Flame nebula once I collect more subs at this angle later on. For now, I will live with this!",
