    "description": "I plan to take a giant 2x3 panel mosaic image to capture the entire main area of Rho Ophiuchi Cloud Complex. However, the sky conditions have been poor for the past few months in Sydney, and my remote observatory malfunction at the dome has delayed this plan. I will postpone this project next year, when all panels will be fully captured with more exposure times :D",
