    "description": "This is a region of sky that I've long wanted to capture so I figured it would be a good first light target for the new QHY183M.\r\nStars aren't as small as I'd have liked but there is still a wealth of detail to be seen within the nebulosity. It's nice to have a foray back into narrowband imaging after 18 months of CMOS.",
