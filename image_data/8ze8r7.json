    "description": "During the evening of December 22nd 2020 Jupiter and Saturn where only 6 arcmin apart!\r\nI had the opportunity of capturing them using my ZWO camera through the Schulman Telescope of the Mount Lemmon Sky Center.\r\nI used the full size sensor to capture both planets and their moons in the same field of view. Then I cropped in in order to get the details of both planets.\r\nAt the end I put together the three images and I adjusted the relative luminosity in order to make it more pleasant. (Jupiter is in reality much brighter than Saturn.)\r\n\r\nAfter capturing the three videos, I removed my camera and mounted an eyepiece on the Schulman telescope. The opportunity of seeing both planets at the same time in the same field of view was quite a life time astronomy experience that I'll never forget!\r\n\r\nCopyright: Alessandro Cavallaro / Mount Lemmon Sky Center / University of Arizona",
