    "description": "This effort was a true open canvas approach.  I had no preconceived vision.  I am really working on the narrow band acquisition and processing techniques, but this one really fell in to place.  I simply wanted an image with color separation and one that accented the cloud structure.  I discuss the acquisition and artistic decisions to this image in the video linked above.\r\n\r\nMy base instinct is not to have an deep sky image with a strong green influence, but after mutiple iterations of color combinations, this one really appealed to me.  The narrow band filters provide freedom to explore what makes the object special, without being obligated to RGB authenticity.  \r\n\r\nLooking forward to more narrow band explorations from the backyard.  Clear skies and take care.\r\n\r\nHa-20x600\r\nOIII-12x60\r\nSII-9x60\r\n\r\nReally need more SII.  The signal here is very nice and worth acquiring more data.  Just don't have enough clear skies to work with this time of year.",
