    "description": "The great seeing from my Jupiter captures deteriorated a little once I got to Saturn, but still this is the best data I've managed this year.\r\n\r\nThis is a de-rotation of 6 x 120s captures, with the top 15% of frames stacked for each.\r\n\r\nNice, distinct banding was evident, and there looks to be a possible storm just south of the polar hexagon.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
