    "description": "Here I set out to see how much IFN (Integrated flux nebulas) I could capture with the RASA in a few hours. The area around M81 and M82 are by now well known for its prominent IFN, although it is still a very faint form of nebulosity. I actually captured more than looked good as it seemed to drown the nice galaxies in there. So in this version I decided not to draw out all the IFN signal that is in the data.\r\n\r\nThis is what Widipedia writes about IFN: Integrated flux nebulas are a relatively recently identified astronomical phenomenon. In contrast to the typical and well known gaseous nebulas within the plane of the Milky Way galaxy, IFNs lie beyond the main body of the galaxy.\r\n\r\nThe term was coined by Steve Mandel-Wilson who defined them as \"high galactic latitude nebulae that are illuminated not by a single star (as most nebula in the plane of the Galaxy are) but by the energy from the integrated flux of all the stars in the Milky Way. These nebulae clouds, an important component of the interstellar medium, are composed of dust particles, hydrogen and carbon monoxide and other elements.\"",
