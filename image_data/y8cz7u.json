    "description": "Messier 13 (NGC 6205) is a globular cluster around 22, 000 light years away in the constellation of Hercules. It was first observed by Halley in 1714 and was entered into Messier's catalogue in 1764. It is around 145 light years in diameter and is one of the brightest clusters in the northern hemisphere. As such, it is often referred to as the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules.\r\n\r\nOne distinctive feature of M13 is the series of dark lanes near the core that form a 'Y' shaped feature, commonly called the propellor. These were first observed in 1850 by Bindon Stoney using Lord Rosseâ€™s renowned 72\" reflector - the 'Leviathan of Parsontown'. In this image, the propellor can be seen just above and left of the core.\r\n\r\nM13 was photographed between 6 and 19 May 2021. Capture details as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nCamera: QSI 683\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nRed: 60 x 300s\r\nGreen: 60 x 300s\r\nBlue: 60 x 300s\r\n\r\nA total of 15 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Steve Milne",
