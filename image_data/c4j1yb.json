    "description": "After about 10-years delay, I decided to recommence H-alpha solar imaging. For that purpose, I assembled a modified Coronado PST telescope, coupled with a TS 102 f/7 refractor. The modification was made with an aid of a specially designed afocal corrector lens (\"Gomal\") installed in front of the Coronado objective. The purpose of the corrector is to converst the incoming light into a parallel beam before it enters the Coronado. The system was introduced and popularized by Russian astrophotographer <a href=\"http://shvedun.ru/solncescop.htm\">Alexey Prudnikov</a>. \"Gomal\" correctors were custom-produced in small amount at the NPZ optical plant in Novosibirsk. I am happy to own one of these rare optical gatgets. About 10 years ago, I used Coronado PST coupled with a 80 mm f/7 refractor, and was really impressed with the system performance. Upgrade to a 100 mm Solarscope afforded even more impressive visual views, along with marvellous photo-quality.\r\n\r\nHere is a first-light picture, showing subsiding active region 2765 close to the solar limb on the morning, 14 July 2020 (7:30 UT). The raw video was taken during my visit to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/astronoom/\">Estonian People's Observatory</a> (Munalaskme, Estonia). \r\n\r\nProcessing details: 16-bit raw video, stacked in AS!3 (600 of 3000 frames), deconvolved in AstraImage. Inverted pseudocolor version. Image B: pseudocolor version.",
