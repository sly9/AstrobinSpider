    "description": "Trifid and Lagoon shot in 2018 on a trip to the UK's south coast. It's pretty hard to capture such a low target from inland UK but if you head down to the coast and have nothing but the sea under the targets, things are becoming a bit easier. I didn't get too much data at that time and originally I didn't even bother to process it, thinking that 9x10min couldn't produce anything good but going back to it now, I'm pretty pleased with the result.",
