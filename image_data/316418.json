    "description": "NGC 55 is a member of the nearby Sculptor group of galaxies.  This group has approximately 30 galaxies within.  Some well-known members include the spiral galaxies of NGC 253 and NGC 300.  NGC 55 is the closest edge-on galaxy that is just 7.5 million light years away.  The galaxy is about 70,000 light years across.  That makes it a little smaller than our own Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the disk reveals an asymmetric extra-planar morphology, and the structure of the disc structure suggests remnants of merger events in the past.  Star formation can be seen throughout the disk.  In the image presented, I incorporated Ha data into the image to highlight these areas with red.   There are also large quantities of gas off the disc plane that are still forming stars.   The galaxy has a bright core, and many young blue star clusters dispersed throughout the galaxy.  Personally, these features give it a three dimensional look, not just flat.",
