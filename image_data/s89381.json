    "description": "Soul Nebula (IC 1848) in Cassiopeia, 7500 LY away...\r\n\r\nMy SII filter seems to have a problem because the signal obtained was very weak... so I first made <a href=\"https://astrob.in/ajols4/C/\"target=\"_blank\"> an HOO version </a>.\r\n\r\nBernard Michaud (<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/litobrit/\"target=\"_blank\">Litobrit</a>) kindly provided me his SII layer so that I could mix it with my own SII layer in order to finally make this SHO version ! Thanks Bernard ! :) \r\n\r\nAs for the HOO version, I still used my own SII layer to recover the color of the stars with the PCC process on Pixinsight.\r\n\r\nJB",
