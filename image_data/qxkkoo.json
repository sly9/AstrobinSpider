    "description": "Here is a bunch of Barnard and VdB nebulae in Auriga taken under rather poor seeing conditions, making the processing challenging. I throw out half of the subs and let the image rest for a while, but fighting an uncomfortable -16Â°C during the data acquisition while watching a miserable guide curve convinced me that I should try to do my best to get a presentable image out of the data.",
