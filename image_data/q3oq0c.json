    "description": "This is my M33 with my Baby Newton 130PDS.\r\nI am amazed at the details even with this small scope, but it needs the field of view with this focal length.\r\n\r\nThis was an almost perfect night with good seeing and transparency.\r\nThe guiding worked well, as did the meridian flip using APT. I only had to sort out 3 images! Three! This is an all time low for me ;-)\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that my shoddy post-processing knowledge was not needed here. The image is only stretched, LP removal and a little saturation in APP.\r\n\r\nThanks for watching\r\nMike",
