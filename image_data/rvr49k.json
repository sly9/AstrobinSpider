    "description": "Hi everybody! Ok, this is not that \"spectacular\", clean nor Hi-Res type of image...\r\nI had the chance of imaging that peculiar nebula in the past, during a star party under a very good sky using my old RC and Back-illuminated camera. The total exposure was not enough for sure but this is not the main point of the image. Recently I've planned many subjects using visual aids on the internet and I noticed, just viewing the DSS colored as visual aid, that this small peculiar nebula was indeed immersed in a very big \"sea\" og HII.\r\nI've tried then to capture, even from a pollutted urban and suburban sky, such a vast glow of H-Alpha light. For doing so, I've used a very different setup in terms of light gather and resolution involving my Takahashi Epsilon and a QSI 683 ccd camera mainly in HA light trough my Astrodon 5nm. I've made long sigle exposures in bin 1x1 and bin 2x2 than I've made a composition with and without stars just for using the faint, diffuse contribution of the Hidrogen light. I then have added also some RGB and luminance data to make a final composition. I've had to use quite strong denoise here but the purpose of the image is not Hi-Res but to show a different \"perspective\".\r\n\r\nFinally here it is the composite image resulting in about 1.5 hours of LRGB light and about 3 more hours just for H-Alpha data.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
