    "description": "M78 taken in LHaRGB. It is the largest of several reflection nebulae in the Orion B molecular cloud complex. While there are two stars within it which makes the nebula visible,  I also really like the dark clouds surrounding it which gives it a lurid sort of appearance, perhaps why some call it Casper the friendly ghost nebula. \r\nThis image comprises a total of 81 subs with a total integration time of 4.4 hours.  I processed it in Pixinsight and tweaked it a little in Photoshop.",
