    "description": "Taken at Fall Creek Falls State Park in TN.\r\n\r\nComposite image of 30+ meteors captured over five hours.\r\n\r\nImage was captured with a Canon 5D3, SkyWatcher Star Adventuer, and a Gitzo tripod.\r\nThree photos taken at ISO 400 for 180s to capture the foreground without tracking.\r\nFive photos taken at ISO 800 for 180s with tracking for pinpoint stars.\r\nPhotos were then taken while tracking at ISO 3200 for 60s with 1s intervals.\r\nI captured approx. 52 meteors but left out ones that did not radiate from the radiant point near Castor and Pollux.\r\n\r\nComposite photo created by star alignment in Pixinsight, then layered in Photoshop with lighten layers to reveal the meteors and ultimately the radiant point.\r\nDefinitely the most outbursts Iâ€™ve seen in years.",
