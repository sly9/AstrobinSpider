    "description": "NGC 2014 and surrounding objects in the LMC. This is a tighter shot than my previous wide field version taken through a TS80. This image was taken through the Skywatcher MN190, with the ASI1600MM-C camera. Camera was set for Unity and running at -25C. There is over six hours of data here, broken down into 25x300s subs for each narrowband channel (Ha, Oiii, and Sii).  Mount is the CGX, guided by PHD2.  Capture managed by SGP, processing with DSS and Photoshop CC 2017.",
