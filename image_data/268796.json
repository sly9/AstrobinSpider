    "description": "Boy is this a dim target!! Shooting with a 71mm scope that is choked down to 64mm didnt help things, I'm sure. :P  I was inspired to shoot this after seeing Goofi's image of this, shot with his NP101. If you haven't seen it yet, please treat yourself and take a peek at it. Its much better than this rendition. \r\n\r\nThis was challenging for me for a couple reasons. The star field is very dense, and the nebula is so dim the RGB showed no detail at all. The Ha required an aggressive stretch to see more than just the brightest area of the nebula. It was difficult to blend the two. Still, such as it is, a very cool area of the sky. :)\r\n",
