    "description": "NGC 488 + surrounding field. A 100MLy distant SA(r)b-type galaxy measuring 151000Ly across. Its incilination is 40Â°, although it looks fairly round. It has quite a number of companion galaxies and a high rotation velocity might refer to a large amount of dark matter in its halo.\r\nTaken during nights with a lot of fog. I am still satisfied with the detail of spiral structure. Lum taken at bin1x1, color at 2x2. I need to remind myself to do color at bin 1x1, since I tend to get artifacts on certain stars.\r\n\r\nedit: I had to redo the color in this picture, because of too much red stars. I selected only those red frames with the lowest FHMW. Only 8 made it in the final pictures :|. However, PI was still giving me very red stars with the photometric color calibration process. After looking through older images (done with the older \"color calibration\" tool) I did the color calibration with the older tool. It turns out better in my opinion. I need to find the appropriate parameter in PCC, otherwise I have to use the CC tool instead.",
