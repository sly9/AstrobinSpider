    "description": "NGC 7026 is a very small PN. The actual size is only 36 x 24 arcseconds. The PN is in a distance of 5900 Lj. The central star shines at 14,2 mag. Both, the magnitude and the distance is not really certain. There are different data available. \r\nThere was recently a very good picture about this PN from Peter Goodhew:\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/f2u9q2/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/f2u9q2/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>\r\nThis is one of the disappeared pictures which I slowly restore!",
