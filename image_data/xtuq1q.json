    "description": "This image features a trio of NGC galaxies that are likely interacting - NGC 7463, 7464, 7465. These galaxies are central in this image. The face-on galaxy, NGC 7465, has an interesting classification - (R')SB0^0?(s) - barely detectable outer pseudo-ring barred spiral. Outlying this galaxy trio grouping is UGC  12313  - an edge on galaxy that lies about the same distance as the NGC trio. Also, galaxy UGC 12321 may be related in that it has a similar distance (by redshift estimate) as the other galaxies, however, this galaxy has a widely discrepant redshift independent distance estimate. Finally, there are several background galaxies with distance estimates around the 1 billion light year distance.  These galaxies  are identified in the <a href=\"http://www.jthommes.com/Astro/images/NGC7463_Edge7_PS5-IP-Riot_annotated.jpg\">annotated image</a>.  There are also a number of background galaxies in this field not identified in the annotation.  Horizontal FOV is approximately 38 arc minutes (0.81 arcsec/pix image scale on the full size image).",
