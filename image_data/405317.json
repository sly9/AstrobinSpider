    "description": "When I look at the amazing objects in the cosmos, I can’t seem to stop my imagination from racing at times.  This galaxy particular is a prime example as it certainly has a lot going on.  I have to admit, this certainly took a long time to arrive with a rendition that I felt was the best I could do at this time.  It almost appears on fire with smoke rising above.  Like a massive intergalactic craft approaching for landing.  In my mind, I can see two search-lights below, and above the disk, the cavitation of gases producing a smoke-like appearance.  Perhaps I should slow down on the coffees :).\r\n\r\nNGC 3521 is classified as a flocculent galaxy.  They have a patchy or fluffy look about them.  About 30 percent of spiral galaxies are flocculent, and about 10 percent are grand design.  The remaining are referred to as multi-armed.  \r\n\r\nNGC 3521 is only 26 million light-years away in the constellation of Leo.  It has a trace of a bar structure and a weak inner ring.  Its centre contains an HII region, classifying it as HII LINER.\r\nGigantic bubble like shells are present around the galaxy.  They are likely to be the result of tidal debris, streams of stars that have been ripped away from satellite galaxies in the distant past.\r\n\r\nInstruments Used:\r\n\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\nLum 92 X 900 seconds\r\nHa 38 X 900 seconds\r\nBlue 38  X 450 seconds\r\nGreen 16 X 450 seconds\r\nRed 30 X 450 seconds\r\n\r\nTotal time 43 Hours",
