    "description": "An interesting region of the North American nebula know as the Cygnus Wall. A roughly 20-light year stretch of star-forming ridges of gas.\r\n\r\nThis data from the 6200 is really clean, and all three SHO wavelengths had relatively strong signals. It was easy to work with up to the point I had to adjust the color palette, at which point I struggled to land on hues I was happy with. It's a start, but I'll probably make another pass with fresh eyes. I've been trying to produce something that doesn't look the same as all my other SHO images, but have found it hard to stray from familiar territory. This SHO image has HOO stars blended in to make them a bit more natural looking.\r\n\r\nComments and critiques always welcome.",
