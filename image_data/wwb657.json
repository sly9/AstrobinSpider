    "description": "NGC 1097 is a Seyfert galaxy, harbouring a supermassive black hole in its centre. There are four mysterious jets in an X shape centred on the nucleus. Two of these pointing to the upper right corner of the image are easily seen here.  The upper one has a right angle bend and is often referred to as the \"Dogleg\". There is a faint suggestion of a third jet to the left of the image opposite the fainter one on the right. This is readily seen in the inverted view.",
