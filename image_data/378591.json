    "description": "This region of Cygnus west of Deneb is anchored by the bright and colorful stars 30 and 31 Cygni. There are many types of interesting and overlapping nebulae in this region including many HII regions catalogued by Dickel, Wendker, and Bieritz, as well as more recent discoveries such as the giant supernova remnant known as G 82.2+5.3 and the much smaller possible planetary nebula PN PM 1-320. This was my most challenging photo yet with more than 46 hours of integration, and the time-consuming process of creating a seamless 8 panel mosaic. This image has been my sole focus from June through November.\r\n\r\nThank you:\r\nMy neighbor Rachel David for being my excellent assistant and \"second in command\" throughout the summer.\r\nSharon Roat, Mt. Cuba Astronomical Observatory, and Frank Colosimo (Blue Mountain Vista) for allowing me to capture many hours of this mosaic away from the streetlights of Newark.\r\nThe Delaware Astronomical Society's Astrophotography Special Interest Group for all the advice and support.\r\nMy friends Andrew and Kurt for their feedback on my work-in-progress.\r\nand Maggie Thrash for supporting me in all things.",
