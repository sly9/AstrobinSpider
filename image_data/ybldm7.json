    "description": "I have re-processed the data collected by Steve and I and also added pooled data from imaging friends - additional luminance data from Steve's TEC image before we installed it at e-Eye (from his home observatory); RGB data from Ole Alexander and Ola Skarpen Ødegård using a Tak TOA150B - thank you to all of them for a joy in processing.  Each of us has produced images using variations of this data, and it is joy to see the different emphases each has made on this glorious target.  I am not sure of the total integration but certainly 50 hours plus.\r\n\r\nFrom Ole's description:\r\n\"This is a picture made up of several observatories.The focus has been to get as deep as possible, I think we have managed to get it pretty good.\r\nImaging telescope or lens:TEC 140, Takahashi TOA150B\r\nImaging camera:QSI 690 wsg-, ZWO ASI6200MM Pro\r\nIntegration: more than 50 hours RGBL+HA\r\nData acquisition: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson, and Askvang Obsevatory Norway\"\r\n\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson.\r\nImaged between 23 Feb and 28 March.2020\r\n\r\nThe links to their magnificent images are:\r\n\r\nOle's: https://astrob.in/n00z79/0/\r\nSteve's: https://astrob.in/rfqgua/0/\r\nOla's: https://astrob.in/n00z79/0/",
