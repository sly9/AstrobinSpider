    "description": "This galaxy was quite surprising- it is really bright, and I initially planned on doing 600s L subs, but after getting RGB data decided that I will do 300s same as for RGB. Managed to pull some great detail considering my scope (5\" with ~40% central obstruction), so quite happy with that. Lots of smaller galaxies out there too, not all cataloged in main catalogs though.\r\nAs always, constructive C&C is much appreciated :)\r\n\r\nMore details on my website",
