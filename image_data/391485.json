    "description": "“Above the clouds”: Waxing Gibbous Moon on February 17th as seen from Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. The winter cloudy sky left a hole for this beautiful view of our satellite.  \r\n\r\nThis picture is a combination of two sets of exposures, separately processed, for the Moon and the wide field sky. This technique allowed me to achieve nice colors and exposure of the clouds and, at the same time, a sharp image of the moon as seen through the hole in the clouds. \r\nMoon shows a lot of details and all areas are well resolved. \r\n\r\nI used a Nikon D90 with Nikon 55-300mm AF-S ED VR lenses\r\nImages have been processed using Photoshop (for the sky) and Autostakkert!3 for the moon part.",
