    "description": "First image for 2018 and back to it after a short break. NGC 2359, Thor's Helmet nebula done in bi colour narrowband. Ha(red), Ha/O3 synth(green) and O3(blue). I did a few hours of S2 but it was almost a complete waste of time! I'll also add some rgb stars when I figure out how to do it properly.",
