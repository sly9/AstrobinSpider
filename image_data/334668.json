    "description": "From Wikipedia:  NGC 3718, also called Arp 214, is a galaxy located approximately 52 million light years from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major. It has a warped, s-shape. probably due to gravitational interaction between it and NGC 3729, another spiral galaxy located 150,000 light-years away. The small group of galaxies below NGC 3718 compose the Hickson 56 group and are believed to be about 400 million light years from Earth. The field of view contains many small distant galaxies.  For example, I believe the tiny sliver on the right is PGC 9115, a magnitude 16.99 spiral galaxy believed to be about 480 million light years from Earth.  It appears to be about 1 arc-minute long.\r\n\r\nFor those that have seen my earlier post of this, I had to repost because the earlier one was lost in a data corruption of the Astrobin server.",
