    "description": "This is Three panel mosaic of the horsehead and flame region near Alnitak in Orion in LHaROIIIGB at 1.18\"/pixel. This took two seasons to collect all the data on the three panels. The processing was done with my latest mosaic workflow in PixInsight. I also used Star halo removal to tame Alintak and Sigma Orionis. This took a long time to process but the halo removal made a huge difference. I put all the methodology into my PixInsight e-book. You can download it on Cloudy nights. This was 33.5 hours per panel for a total of ~100 hours of data. I also used HDR combination of short exposures of the color data to fix the star cores.",
