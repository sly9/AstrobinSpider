    "description": "This is a small round nebula appears to be about 1' across and has a fairly high surface brightness. It was easily visible without an OIII filter through the 20\" scope. No central brightening is visible and no stars are scattered across the face. A 13th magnitude star is positioned just west of the nebula's edge. The OIII filter increased the visual brightness of the nebula, but it did not increase the size or shape at all. IC1624 is located 4' due south of NGC 395. The nebula is best viewed without a filter, as the background stars are still visible.\r\n20hrs data of HaoRGB with 12\"f9 RC chile \r\nimage copyright ; franck jobard , utkarsh mishra, michael petrasko, muir evenden",
