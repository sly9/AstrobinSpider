    "description": "I gave a second try on this sector with an unfiltered DSLR and well something is visible...\r\nIt's a difficult region to attempt as it's full of dark nebulae and I'm shooting with a sky that could really be better.\r\n\r\n2 min subs at only 400ISO and a lens aperture at F2 is enough to get a pale sky.\r\nHard treatment when you stack light pollution!\r\n\r\nWhatever, I enjoyed to do it and I'm quite happy with the result even if I had to soften the noise a bit.",
