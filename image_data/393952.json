    "description": "These are definitely my favorite types of object. This bit of intergalactic chaos is object number 245 in Arp's catalogue of 'peculiar' galaxies. These two galaxies are seen 100 million years after their collision (coincidentally they are about 103 million light years away), and the debris is spread around the space in between. Although the very flat galaxy below and to the right is probably a chance alignment, there are a few papers suggesting that the knot of stars at the top of the plume of debris will form a dwarf galaxy.\r\nThis is only about 4 hours of integration in total, but the clouds have rolled in and appear set to see out this new moon period, so unfortunately I'll have to wait a month to add any data to this.",
