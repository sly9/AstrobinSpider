    "description": "This is a panormaic image of our Milky Way from horizon to hortion composed of 4 panels. Here from the Southern Hemisphere, it's a beautiful and unique sight - the Milky Way's center right overhead, especially at Winter (~July).\r\n\r\nThe feeling of being under dark skies, and look up and see the galactic arc on the sky is one of the most universal breathtaking sights. If you have not yet had such pleasure, I strongly recommend it - it is worth a trip below the Equator!\r\n\r\nFrom left to right, you can see amongst others, the constellations of Aquila, Scutum, Sagittarius, Ophiucus, Scorpius, Lupus, and on the far right, Crux (Southern Cross). Near the southern horizon a meteor was also captured on one of the exposures!\r\n\r\n*Please check the full size image (5000px)*\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, comments and suggestions are more than welcome in the comments section. Thank's for taking your time to look at this image.\r\n\r\nTaken from Rural Skies (Bortle 3-4; NELM ~6.2; SQM ~21.4*calculated), from MG, Brazil (22ÂºS latitude).\r\n\r\nDate and Time: July 20, 2017 at 20:30 \r\nCamera: Unmodded Canon T4i/650D, at ISO 1600\r\nLens: Canon 18-135mm STM (kit lens) @ 18mm, f/4.5\r\nMount: Sky-Watcher EQ3-2, tracking\r\nExposure Detail: 4 panels, 120s each (total 4 min)",
