    "description": "Sometimes all you need is patience.\r\n\r\nIn March 2020 I decided to take this supernova remnant known as IC443 as my next target. It was late for the season for this, and I could only shoot it an hour per night. A bit frustrating, but with automated setup it was doable. My goal was to finish it until the astronomical darkness was to end here in North. Soon after I got started, our observatory had an electrical malfunction which ended our season.\r\n\r\nAs the new season started in August 2020, I could only dream of getting back to this gem. At the end of september, I got my first new frames of this right until sunrise. During october I could get some hours of this during morning hours.\r\n\r\nIn mid November I was finally near to getting my goal of total 16 hours done: I was left short of 1 hour of S-II and an hour of RGB. After that, skies remained cloudy for almost following 3 weeks. Yesterday, I finally crossed the finish line.\r\n\r\n9 months and 15 hours of exposure.",
