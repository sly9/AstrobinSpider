    "description": "After a very long time I was able to start taking pictures again!\r\n\r\nThis image of NGC1333 was taken several month ago under a decent sky in Tuscany. Sky was not perfect and some haze and high clouds where present. Anyway I spent some time trying to make a best render of this not so easy subject. The picture has been acquired using a Takahashi Epsilon 210 telescope (not perfectly collimated, You will see it in the corners) on an Astro-Physics Match1 GTO Mount. Camera was a QSI 583 with Astrodon filters guided with a Starlight Xpress Lodestar. I can't be super precise with total integration time but should be around 5 total hours of LRGB under 3 nights.\r\n\r\nHope You like it!\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks for watching!\r\n",
