    "description": "The Pelican Nebula (IC5070 and IC5067) is a large and bright nebula in the constellation of Cygnus. Right next to the North America nebula, it forms a complex structure which is quite pleasing to the eye. Imaged here with the Hubble palette (SHO), it is easy to observe the strength of OIII in this area, represented in the image in blue. The Pelican and North America nebulae are separated by a molecular cloud filled with dust. These are areas where stars are being born. In this image, though a bit hard to see due to the image scale (see large version), it is possible to identify a typical Herbig-Haro object (HH-555), with its jets denoting the presence of a proto-star (for reference, see see https://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr03/hh555.html). These objects can be seen in star forming regions; the jets represent ionized gas colliding with molecular clouds and dust",
