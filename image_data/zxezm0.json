    "description": "The beginning of a multi-year and larger project that won't be finished until next season, but it's been yet another 6 months since a new image was published.  I have a few in the backlog that I need to get out and am finally gathering more data again slowly. (looking at you, Eric)  This is a bicolor presentation consisting of Ha-OIII-OIII.  \r\n\r\nI hope to start uploading some images to replace the corrupted files soon, but there are a couple hundred and it will probably take some time.  Nice to be back and browsing some images here again!",
