    "description": "NGC 4631, the Whale Galaxy, is the edge-on barred spiral galaxy at bottom left.  It is approximately 30 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici.  Beneath NGC 4631 is its close companion the dwarf elliptical galaxy NGC 4627, also known as the Pup.  NGC 4631 has a core of older, yellow stars surrounded by young blue stars.  It has a dark equatorial dust lane and many emission nebulae glowing with the magenta of ionished Hydrogen.  The central region of the galaxy is a starburst region where new stars are rapidly forming.\r\n\r\nAt top right is the highly distorted pair of interacting galaxies NGC 4656 and NGC 4657, also known as the Hockey Stick Galaxies.\r\n\r\nThese galaxies are all members of the NGC 4631 group.\r\n\r\nCaptured at SRO.\r\n\r\nAcquisition credit: Scott Johnson, Augusto Hernandez, John Kasianowicz, Daniele Malleo, Jose Mtanous and Rick Stevenson\r\n\r\nProcessing credit & copyright: Rick Stevenson",
