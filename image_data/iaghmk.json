    "description": "The data collection for this image started in 2019 and was finally finished this year as a stage one; stage two, if we undertake the challenge, will be to add OIII data.  This is a 6 panel mosaic with its assembly helped greatly by using PI's PhotoMetric Mosaic script created by John Murphy: well done John for a great tool.\r\n\r\nThe target needs little introduction being both very extensive in apparent size and faint of course ;-) From Wikipedia: \"Simeis 147, also known as the Spaghetti Nebula, SNR G180.0-01.7 or Sharpless 2-240, is a supernova remnant (SNR) in the Milky Way, straddling the border between the constellations Auriga and Taurus. Discovered in 1952 at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory using a 25-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, it is difficult to observe due to its extremely low brightness. The nebulous area is fairly large with an almost spherical shell and filamentary structure.[2] The remnant has an apparent diameter of approximately 3 degrees, an estimated distance of approximately 3000 (Â±350) light-years, and an age of approximately 40,000 years.[3] It is believed that after its stellar explosion a rapidly spinning neutron star known as pulsar PSR J0538+2817 was left behind in the nebula core, emitting a strong radio signal.[4]\"\r\n\r\nDespite quite abundant data this target was harder to process than I anticipated, to realise the balance between a natural appearance and a discernible nebula without too much contrast.  The final jpeg image is 27+Mb, so I have also uploaded an 80% jpeg for ease.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nprocessing: Barry Wilson",
