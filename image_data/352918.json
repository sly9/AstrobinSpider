    "description": "Sh2-51 and Barnard 313. This is a very dim and difficult hydrogen emission nebula that is rarely imaged and another  immersed in a rich star filed. \r\n\r\nThe brighter nebula near the center of the image is Sh2 51 in Sagittarius. It measures close to the diameter of the full moon with cataloged dimensions of 35'X35'. \r\n\r\nIt is part of a larger nebula that looks like an old boat anchor and extends beyond Barnard 313 at the top left of the image.\r\n\r\nI have included an annotated version as the \"Original\"",
