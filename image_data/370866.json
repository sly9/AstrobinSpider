    "description": "Region around Polaris has some really awesome dusty regions, which are really sucked up by Samyang 135mm F2. Currently I spend a lot of time fixing stuff in a house we recently moved into, thus reducing time I have to process images, so I am really glad that I finally found enough time to finish this one. At this rate I image more images than I process, so the processing backlog is only growing (not saying it is a bad thing per-se).",
