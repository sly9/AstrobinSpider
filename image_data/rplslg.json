    "description": "Found out about this comet yesterday so thought would give it a go and this morning had a break in the clouds before dawn.  Also, some very fortunate timing as I saw that a faint galaxy was just to the left which have found out this morning is the Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte irregular galaxy located at 3.4m LY.  13 of my 30 captures were processable.  Pleased to have picked this up before it moves out of my viewing space.\r\n\r\nFeel honoured to have won the ZWO ASIWEEK Image of the Week #22 today 4th of May with this image.  Did not get picked for top pick or IOTD on Astrobin but not a worry given there are also so many wonderful images from which to choose.",
