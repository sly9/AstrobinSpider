    "description": "This is my rendition of the jellyfish nebula (IC443) together with it's \"tentacles\" (SH2-249) as a 2 frame narrowband mosaic. I'm also pretty fond of the tiny planetary nebula Howell-Crisp 1 (HoCr 1) in the lower left of the frame :)\r\n\r\nI had a lot of problems postprocessing this one as there are two massively bright stars in the frame which left me with nasty microlens diffraction and reflection effects. Unfortunately I cannot do any better than this, so I left it as it is now and consider it done.\r\n\r\nTaken at unity gain(139).",
