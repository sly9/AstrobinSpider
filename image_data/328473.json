    "description": "This object is an open cluster of about 60 stars located 5000 light years away in the constellation of Canis Major.  This is one of my favorite clusters.  I like it because of the contrast in brightness between the bright star (Tau Canis Majoris, the namesake of the cluster and the only one to have evolved away from the main sequence), and the other still bright but relatively dimmer stars around it.  There is no doubt that it is a cluster, in how it stands out from the surrounding sky.  It is estimated to be one of the youngest star clusters known.\r\n\r\nThis was a tough one to process because of the bright star artifacts that always result from using my ZWO camera.",
