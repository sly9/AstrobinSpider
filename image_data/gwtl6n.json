    "description": "I’m not sure that this view needs much introduction since it is one of the most frequently photographed large nebulae in the sky. In fact the Rosette Nebula’s apparent extent is so large, you could stack 3 full moons in this image top-to-bottom. In actuality, it’s 130 light years across, and about 5200 light years distant.\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\r\nNow into some detail about how I created the image...\r\nThis was my first light using the Radian Triad Ultra filter from OPT. This is a narrowband filter containing 4 band-passes for Sulfur, Hydrogen Alpha, Oxygen, and Hydrogen Beta. What does that mean? Used in front of a color camera like the ASI533MC, you can shoot high-contrast details in emission nebula like this and gather all this data in one shot. I have to admit, I had some reservations about how this would work on a fast telescope like the RASA, but I think it performed admirably.  Don't hesitate to contact me if you have questions on this setup... a lot of people do!",
