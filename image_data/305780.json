    "description": "IC 5146, the Cocoon Nebula, is a great collection interesting celestial sights.  the glowing red hydrogen and blue reflection nebulae paid with a young star cluster and dark nebulae.  There are even cameos by three small spiral galaxies.  Interestingly, the star at the center of the nebula is believed to be only a few hundred thousand years old (at the time these photons were created) making it the star equivalent of a human baby perhaps weeks old.\r\n\r\nThis is an all LRGB combination comprised of  35 Luminance, 50 Red, 54 Green, 40 Blue all 600 seconds.  Total integration 29.833 hours.  It may seem odd that there is less Luminance time than color but the color is bin 1x1 and adding more really helped with noise in the dark nebula portions.  That and I pruned Lum subs pretty heavily.  One of  the reasons I shot the color bin 1 is to be able to add it to the luminance as a synthetic blend but I have not done that yet so this is straight LRGB only.\r\n\r\nSubs were calibrated in CCDStack, subsequently processed in PI with minimal DBE and TGV De-noise.  No sharpening was applied as it seems to only add noise but not improve sharpness.  A light motion blur de-convolution was applied in PI to resolve slightly out of round stars.  Finishing touches in PS and Apple photos.",
