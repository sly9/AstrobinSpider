    "description": "M91 (NGC 4548) is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Coma Berenices.  It is one of the faintest Messier objects at approximately magnitude 11.  M91 is about 63 million light-years away and has an apparent size of 5.4 x 4.3 arc minutes.  The observation of Cepheid variable stars by the Hubble Space Telescope confirmed that M91 is a member of the Virgo Cluster [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/307151/fulltext/39340.text.html].   M91 is classified as “anemic” for its relative lack of star forming regions and gas, possibly resulting from ram pressure stripping as it passes through the dense galaxy cluster [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1999A%26A...349..411V].\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the image!",
