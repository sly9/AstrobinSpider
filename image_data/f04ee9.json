    "description": "I was a little late in this game so it took a long time to collect enough data for a decent image. My plan was to have a lot of NB data and just enough RGB data to have color stars. After I did my first channel combination I noticed that I hated all the rainbow colors the master showed. Not having enough RGB data left me scratching my head until I thought I'll try the HDRCombination putting together each of two channels S + R, H + G and O + B. After combining these new masters I got a more natural looking palette which I then started to work with. At the end it came down again to decide how dominant one wants the Red to be and how much that Blue / Green hue around the Nebula should show. I'm not a big fan of Green color so my M1 is maybe more Bluish than Greenish. \r\n\r\nI did more convolution and color saturation to my stars than usually and I really like the way they turned out. This might be my new go-to process for the color stars going forward. When it comes to the Nebula itself, well I wish I would have had more focal length. It would have really helped to bring out those fainter dust lines inside the Crab.",
