    "description": "I wanted to do this for some time now. Sadly, the seeing was absolutely catastrophic that night. ðŸ˜±That's why the bright stars are so ugly and bloated. After the first hour I almost stopped the session, but otherwise it was a beautiful night, so I let it run and watched lots of meteors. The processing was no fun this time.ðŸ˜œ\r\nI'll try again with better seeing in a while.ðŸ™‚",
