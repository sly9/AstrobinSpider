    "description": "Sh2-216 Bi-Color with RGB stars. This planetary nebula is very large and very faint! It is also said to be the second closest to the earth.\r\n While capturing this nebula I was not able to really see any noticeable signal. I was doubtful of what the final outcome might be. But, after capturing a good bit of data, stretching the resulting stack really hard, removing the stars, and adding back in RGB stars this was my final result. A little noisy but none the less an image. While looking at this image it reminds me of a jellyfish with no tendrils and to the lower left is a crab creature with two glowing eyes. Maybe I have stared at it too long? LOL!\r\n\r\nOverall I think I could have benefited greatly with a narrower band OIII filter and Ha filter. As my current ones are 7nm. Hmmmm... maybe some 3nm filters are in order? Thanks go to Uwe for putting this thought in my head. LOL!",
