    "description": "A newly-discovered nebula in Hercules. This is a potential planetary nebula, and we hope to obtain a spectrum soon that will help in confirming that it is. \r\n\r\nDana Patchick originally spotted some faint nebulosity on a POSS (Palomar Observatory Sky Survey) plate back on 14 January 2016, but never got around to getting someone to capture an image of it. So he asked me if I would give it a shot.  Here's the result, with a small bright blue star at the centre of the image - a promising CSPN (Central Star of a Planetary Nebula).  The star is magnitude 17.12, has a temperature of 40,338.5K, and a stellar mass of 0.41.",
