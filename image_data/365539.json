    "description": "A mountainous ridge line dominates the neck of the Pelican Nebula in Cygnus.  IC5067 is rich with dust and gas sculpted by stellar winds from newly born stars.  Many gas pillars are present and the rightmost displays a Herbig-Haro object as narrow jets of partially ionized gas are ejected from new stars and collide with surrounding gases at high speeds.  These last for only a short time, on the order of tens of thousands of years. The ridge spans approximately 10 light years at a distance of ~2000 ly from Earth.\r\n\r\nAs was the case for my <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/328285/?nc=user\" >Flaming Star image</a>, in the midst of tone mapping this process I decided it might turn out well as a starless image.  I also processed a starry version as well (version B).  Data acquired over 11 nights between 6/25 and 7/12.\r\n\r\nWeb sites:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.stellarsolace.com/\">StellarSolace</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StellarSolace-1588021434610921/\">Facebook page</a>",
