    "description": "Here I used 12 Hrs of new luminance data (48x15 mins teamed up with Steve and Lis Milne and Tom O'Donoghue) to blend into an earlier 20 hour image. Old image, TEC 140/Atik 4000/Tak EM200. New image TEC140/Atik 460/Mesu 200. We did shoot new colour as well but I've been too busy to process it so I stuck with the old which was fully processed.\r\n\r\nThis is a noisy target so the extra luminance was very welcome and was applied at about 65% over the old.",
