    "description": "This is the star forming region NGC 6559. Visible above are red glowing emission nebulas of hydrogen, blue reflection nebulas of dust, dark absorption nebulas of dust, and the stars that formed from them. The first massive stars formed from the dense gas will emit energetic light and winds that erode, fragment, and sculpt their birthplace. And then they explode. This is so beautiful as it is complex. After tens of millions of years, the dust boils away, the gas gets swept away, and all that is left is a naked open cluster of stars (based on APOD information).\r\n\r\nNGC 6559 is located at a distance of about 5000 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Sagittarius.\r\n\r\nThis image was captured during a two days campagn in June 2017. It was captured using L,R,G and B filters and processed using Pixinsight.\r\n\r\nIt is published in the Sky & Telescope Magazine, digital version (http://www.skyandtelescope.com/online-gallery/ngc-6559-in-lrgb-stars-dust-and-nebula/)",
