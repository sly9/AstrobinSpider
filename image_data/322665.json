    "description": "I tried this target last year and I wasn't quite happy with the result. This year I've added nearly 15hs\r\nof Ha and hence I was able to drizzle and get a much cleaner version; in particular the faint outer halo is more prominent now. The oiii and sii were taken about a year ago with the same equipment.\r\nFor some reason this nebula reminds me of the alien helmet from Prometheus... No dolphin for me.",
