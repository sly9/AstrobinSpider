    "description": "Abell 66 (PK019-23.1) is a very rarely imaged planetary nebula in Sagittarius.  Abell66 is a medium sized Abell, measuring 4.5 arc minutes and has a magnitude listed at 14.9. It shows just barely on the RGB image. Both Ha and Oiii make a good contribution, the Oiii strong in the center of its circular form, and the Ha forming a strong outer ring.  A central blue star can just be made out, somewhat overlapped by a similar small white star.\r\n\r\nMy Collections:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae (Complete)</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2627/\" target=\"_new\">Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2626/\" target=\"_new\">Galaxies</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2625/\" target=\"_new\">Sharpless 2 Ob",
