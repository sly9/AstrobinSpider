    "description": "It is a summer break for me until August. I do not image because there is no astronomical night here until July, and then the night would be too short. Meanwhile I'm learning how to process the data.\r\n\r\nThis image is based on the same raw data as the previous Needle:<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/8n7ddi/E/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/8n7ddi/E/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\" alt=\"NGC4565 The Needle. Beautiful as always\"/></a>.\r\n\r\nHowever the various processing steps in PixInsight were changed or improved. Different CFA drizzle integration parameters were used. The RGB channels alignment was apparently wrong in the old image.\r\n\r\nAlso I think that I've finally learned how to apply deconvolution. It looks like I've selected wrong stars (too bright) for the PSF calculation in the past.\r\n\r\nI've followed a good advice posted by Jon Rista in a Cloudy Nights thread <a href=\"https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/533065-keeping-star-color-in-pixinsight-lrgb/#entry7147316\">Keeping Star Color in PixInsight / LRGB</a> to stretch the image.\r\n\r\nThe most visible difference with the previous image is the color calibration. I've used ColorCalibration process with the galaxy as a white reference instead of PhotometricColorCalibrarion. This is not entirely correct for an edge on galaxy, but it looks to me that it makes more details visible. Revision B uses PhotometricColorCalibration, all other processing steps are exactly the same.\r\n\r\nCS and thanks for looking,\r\nVitali",
