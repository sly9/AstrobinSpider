[wikipedia]\r\n\r\nI have captured RGB data for this image in May 2019 with a DSLR. I managed to expose it for 5.5 hours with a Nikon D7100 at ISO 800. In Jan 2020 I revisited this area with my ZWO 1600 and gathered 7.5 hours of luminance data.\r\nDetailed exposure info:\r\nLum: 150*3 min (at Gain 139)\r\nRGB: 110*3min (at ISO 800)\r\nTotal exposure: 13 hours",
