    "description": "M77 - Barred Spiral Galaxy. \r\n\r\nThis is one of the first targets that I had started acquire when I got the QHY600. There are plenty of things that are wrong with this image - the bias was not set very well which not only means that I have some black dots in the background, but it also means that in order to minimize those black dots, I had to lower the clipping factor which means that some of the satellite trails haven't integrated out. \r\n\r\nFor now, I am going to call this target done. I have since changed the bias to ensure I am not clipping any black point, which is helping - so this target allowed me some practice and iron out kinks in my workflow - nothing should go to waste!!",
