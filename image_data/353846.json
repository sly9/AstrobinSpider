    "description": "Second try at posting this as the first was lost when the astrobin db was restored.\r\n\r\nThis is a 2 frame mosaic which uses Astro Pixel Processor to stack and create the mosaic and Startools to do the rest.  As with the single frame Rho Ophiuchi, I have problems with halos around brighter stars.  This image was also stretched more aggressively to bring out the nebulosity in the head of the Scorpio.  85x180s at f/2.",
