    "description": "This was never going to work perfectly and I knew this going into it. It's very noisy and has very little detail and that's because I can only image it for 75 minutes at a time from 26° to 18° - between a tree and my roof - mostly over Philadelphia. There were nights that the light pollution was so significant that I had trouble keeping a guide star. In addition, my tracking that low on the horizon was absolutely terrible and I had issues with star trailing. Since just about every sub was bad, I just left them all in and didn't cull any subs unless they had a plane in them. The data are flawed, I knew they would be, but I love this subject so much that I couldn't resist imaging it.",
