    "description": "The NGC 5416 group of galaxies is locatad in the constellation Bo√∂tes.\r\n\r\nNear NGC 5431 there is a tail which looks like a tidal tail, but I didn't find any information about this phenomenon. It is totally ignored, not mentioned at all.\r\n\r\nThere are also to seen a few distant Quasars. The age of the most distant Quasar in this image is 11,743 Giga years\r\n\r\nThe gif shows PMSs (proper motion stars),I have marked 9 PM stars, but the image contains way more.The elapsed time between the two images is 66 years.\r\n\r\nThe b&w image is a DSS1 plate from 1954",
