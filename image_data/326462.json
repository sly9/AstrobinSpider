    "description": "The Orion Nebula is a combination of reflection and emission nebulae and lies some 1350 light years away, making it the closest region of intense star formation.  Positioned in Orion's sword, this nebula is one of the most popular in the sky and is visible with the unaided eye.   The Trapezium, a very young open cluster of stars is visible in the center of the nebula as four distinct closely huddled stars.   The red and blue nebulosity throughout this region come from the emission and reflection nebulae.  The blue comes from the light of the massive stars at the center of the nebula scattering off dust, while the red coloration comes from electrons in gaseous Hydrogen falling to lower orbital levels.  Above the main nebulosity is the Running Man nebula which also contains emission and reflection nebulae providing it's distinctive outline.  Throughout this frame the associated dust is also visible.",
