    "description": "Our Milky Way is actually full of dust but hidden in the black starry background, it is not easy to see.  Only by accumulating a long time of exposure, the dust that pervades the stars will show up, presenting rich details of intricate complexity.\r\n\r\nThis large patch of dust in the picture is part of the Perseus molecular cloud, located at the junction of Taurus, Aries, and Perseus, about 1,000 light-years away from the Earth.  The dust with a total mass equivalent to 10,000 suns is gathered in clusters or twisted into twists. The thick areas are dense and opaque, and darker than space itself.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest corner, new light is gestating.\r\n\r\nThe dust near the center, a little red light came out from it, that was a star cluster forming in it.  Beside this dust, a newborn star dispelled the haze, illuminating the surroundings with bright light, and became the brightest deep-sky object in this area.\r\n\r\n Location: Hebei Kangbao Galaxy Observatory\r\n Filming time: November 7, 2020-February 4, 2021\r\n Telescope: Sharpstar 150 2.8 HNT\r\n Camera: QHY268C\r\n Mount: Aton iOptron CEM70/CEM60\r\n Guide: QHYCCD OAG-M\r\n Guide camera: QHY5L-II-M\r\n Number of shots: 130×1000 seconds, 70×300 seconds\r\n Cumulative exposure: 41.9 hours\r\n Shooting software: APT\r\n Processing software: PixInsight, PhotoShop",
