    "description": "Hello all!\r\n\r\nIt's been two months in the making. And despite vacations, crappy weather, and equipment reconfiguration, I'VE FINALLY FINISHED! This image consists of 30 hrs each Ha and Oiii (3nm) as well as 1hrs each of RGB data for the stars. I shot the RGB data the past two night during the full moon so a little more data was needed. I originally thought 30 min each would do the trick but 1hr each produced much more colorful stars. This is my longest project to date so I tried to be pretty meticulous when it came to post processing, especially in getting that outer Oiii shell to show. I call it the energy shield! Anyways, I hope you all enjoy!\r\n\r\nEqiupiment: \r\nAT8RC\r\nCEM60\r\nASI1600mm-pro\r\nAstrodon HA/OIII/RGB\r\nQHY5L-ii autoguider\r\nphd, spg, pix, ps, dss\r\n\r\nExposure details:\r\n180x600s (ha)\r\n180x600s (Oiii)\r\n60x60x RGB (ea.)\r\n\r\nDates:\r\n7/4, 7/5, 7/6, 7/7, 7/9, 7/28, 7/29, 7/30, 8/1, 8/2, 8/3, 8/4, 8/6, 8/7, 8/11 8/12, 8/13, 8/14, 8/15, \r\n\r\nClear skies!\r\nTeagan Grable",
