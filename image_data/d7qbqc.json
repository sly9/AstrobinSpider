    "description": "The Little Cocoon Nebula (Little Trifid Nebula), Sharpless 2-82 (Sh2-82) in the constellation Sagitta.\r\nThis combination HII region and reflection nebula, also called LBN 129 and DG 159, is ionised by the B0.5V star HD 231616. With the current distance estimate, it appears to be near the Vul OB4 association. Inside the cloud sources of infrared radiation have been identified, including one generated from a protostar deeply shrouded in gas. Radio waves originating from small sources have also been detected, a sign that there are processes of star formation on-going inside the cloud.\r\n\r\nThis image taken in August 2019.",
