    "description": "\r\nAlmost 100% illuminated, even so many details visible in this photo of 4000 pixels wide.\r\nThe Moon is the closest celestial object on Earth and therefore the easiest to observe. Its vision through instruments is superb and even with the naked eye we can identify many characteristics of its surface, as well as several astronomical events involving the beautiful Luna in the course of each Lunation (Rosely Gregio)\r\nFor us atrophotographs then, a true full plate, because the variation of lighting and angle is so much, that we can spend a lifetime and never photograph it accurately in the same way.",
