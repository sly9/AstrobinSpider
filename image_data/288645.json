    "description": "M78 is considered the brightest reflection nebula in our sky.  The complex is actually part of a much larger cloud of interstellar gas and dust known as the Orion B molecular cloud.   M78 is the large bluish area in the middle with the lower part known as NGC 2071.  AT the top of the image is a large column of dark dust with several bright outpourings of radiation, indicating the formation of stars within.  The topmost small bright patch in this area is McNeal's Nebula, only recently discovered in 2004 indicating that it is a very young formation.  Visible changes in nebulae over a human lifetime are rare.\r\n\r\nM78 lies on the edge of what is known as Bernard's Loop, a huge loop of glowing red interstellar hydrogen almost surrounding the constellation of Orion.\r\n\r\nM78 lies at a distance of approximately 1300 light-years.
