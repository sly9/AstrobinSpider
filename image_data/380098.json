    "description": "I struggled to find an easy path when processing this quite delicate subject finding the star field (beautiful as it is) over-powering the faint and pinkish nebulous regions, although the blue reflection nebula faired much better.  Steve and I did find mixed sky conditions during capture and I do wonder with better seeing if we would have managed to pick out more discernible structure.\r\n\r\nThere is a faint redish tint to the background sky and I hazard that there is some faint gas in and around the nebula and across the FOV which I have left in judging it to be real (though not 100% sure).\r\n\r\nThanks for looking and C&Cs always welcome.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne.\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson.",
