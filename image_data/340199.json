    "description": "This is my recently completed work of a lesser-imaged region in Draco featuring a field full of small galaxies centered around NGC6340.  This feature galaxy is quite small (3' x 2.8') especially for my 800mm focal length, and for this reason mostly has only high-focal-length surveys.  I was really interested in adding a wider field to the mix since there really are some very unique (albeit small) galaxies buried in the skies throughout this region.\r\n\r\nIn addition to NGC6340, some of my favorites:\r\n\r\n- IC1251 is an unbarred spiral galaxy (class Sc) with striking blue character sitting just north of NGC6340.\r\n\r\n- Just to the north-east (top-left) of NGC6340 sits another unbarred spiral galaxy in IC1254 (class Sc) with faintly-colored curved dust extents stretching from its core\r\n\r\n- PGC59908 is a dim 14th magnitude barred spiral galaxy (class SB) to the east (left) of this frame, displaying some deep hues and reaching out with very faint dusty arms\r\n\r\n- Making a striking resemblance to a polar-ring galaxy is PGC59812, peeking in at the north of the frame and with a classification that is as-yet unspecified",
