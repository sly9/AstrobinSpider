    "description": "Collected this over three half nights more as a filler target with most of the earlier evening imaging the Whirling Dervish nebula. That one (Whirling Dervish) is proving a tough target to process even with 15+ hours, so have gone ahead and processed what I have with this much brighter nebula (Lagoon).\n\n10 hours of 300s exposures.\n\nStacked in APP into Ha, OIII and SII channel and recombined and processed in Startools.\n\nIt's nice to have plenty of signal to really push an image :-)",
