    "description": "I tested out my new filter from Altair Astro - a QuadBand OSC narrowband filter. Unfortunately the clouds rolled in later in the night, so I could only capture 26 usable frames using the new filter. It's going to be cloudy for at least the next week, so I decided to just process it with some light frames I already captured using the Optolong L-eNhance filter.\r\n\r\nIn the limited data I captured, the Altair QuadBand filter does appear to help me get better results with my RASA - there is noticeably more faint red nebulosity in the Altair QuadBand light frames compared to the L-eNhance light frames.\r\n\r\nWhen I've previously been processing data captured with the RASA and L-eNhance filter, I've noticed I don't always pick up much faint red nebulosity.  I attributed this to the narrower bandwidth of the red channel (10nm).  In comparison, the Altair QuadBand filter has a wider bandwidth of 35nm on the red channel.  \r\n\r\nI immediately noticed more red nebulosity in the light frames - it's faint (this target is faint anyway), but much more prominent than in the L-eNhance light frames captured under similar conditions a few nights prior.",
