    "description": "In this Mercator Panorama, the Zodiacal light is very visible. In May early dawns, the ecliptical line are completly perpendicular to the horizon. This image was created in Namibia, where the sky quality is 10/10. No light pollution, no moisture, and low temp (May). Its ideal to create amazing astrophotos and landscape astrophotos.",
