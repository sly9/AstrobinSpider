    "description": "This shot was something I wanted to capture since long time. \"Rainbow\" projection of the Milky Way with loads of fantastic night sky objects and reference points. Ofc, due to the projection and bent perspective, some of the distances does not match what we can see with our eyes. I was lucky to frame 3 planets as well as at least 10 emission nebulae.\r\n\r\nNoticeable deep sky objects: Pleiades (M45), California (NGC1499), Soul (IC1848), Heart (IC 1805), Andromeda Galaxy (M31), NGC 7822, Elephant Trunk (IC1396), North America (NGC7000), Pelican (IC5070), Butterfly (IC1318), Eagle (M16), Omega (M17), Trifid (M20), Lagoon (M8)\r\n\r\nPlanets: Mars, Saturn, Jupiter",
