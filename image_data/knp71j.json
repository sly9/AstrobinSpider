    "description": "Recently I started working on an image of the Vela SNR. While working on it, I decided to go back and take a look at my image of the Veil/Pickering's Triangle (<a href=\"https://astrob.in/vy6efi/0/\">previous version here</a>). I decided that I liked the colors that I was coming up with in the Vela SNR better, so I decided on a reprocess. I also decided that I liked the landscape orientation better as well. I think this image is a bit more pleasing.\r\n\r\nYour C and C always welcome!",
