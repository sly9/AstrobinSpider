    "description": "The Witch Nebula is illuminated by the supergiant star Rigel, in Orion. In this image South is upward, to emphasize the Nebula's amazing shape, from which it gets its name.\r\n\r\nThe Witch Head nebula is a reflection nebula, meaning that we see it mostly because it is being illuminated by a nearby object (Rigel in this case). You also get emission nebula, which are lit mostly by light from within; and absorption nebulae, which are seen mostly in silhouette.",
