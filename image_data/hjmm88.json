    "description": "This is my rendition of the NGC6992 using sample data from the DeepSkyWeb Remote Hosting facility. The data is from the amazing Astro-Physics Starfire 175 with an FLI ML16070 mono camera and Astrodon LRGBSHO 5nm filters. The data was very clean and perfectly calibrated, so my objective was to create this image without over-processing. \r\n\r\nThanks Deep Sky West, CS!",
