    "description": "Here we have SH2-82, The Little Cocoon Nebula.  This is an emission/reflection nebula located in 1,100p away in the constellation Sagitta.\r\n\r\nThis is a star nursery and has some similarities to The Cocoon nebula and The Trifid Nebula.\r\n\r\nThe bright star near the center of it is HD 231616 which ionizes the cloud of gas and dust.  As much as I like the bright and colorful nebula, I also liked the dark nebulae that appear in this frame and tried to preserve and highlight that as much as I could.\r\n\r\nThis was a nice project to do and I decided to try to use Ha and Oiii to try to enhance the reflection and emission nebula.  The Oiii data was weak as with any Oiii filter I've used with HyperStar, reflections from any moderately bright star really causes problems.  My cables across the corrector plate were not quite at 90 degrees so the diffraction spikes are a little off too.\r\n\r\nI would have liked to do a little more RGB on this but alas, the monsoon season is upon us and I thought the night of July 10 was going to be my last chance.  I also have learned that it just does not pay to try to do RGB with the moon present so I packed all the RGB into the time between astro dark and when the moon rose.  Fortunately for me, i do have a mountain near me to the east which gave me a litle more time before the moon appeared.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you like this one... comments/criticism always encouraged.\r\n\r\nCS and good health...",
