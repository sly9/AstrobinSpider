    "description": "This image shows the result of my imaging sessions in the Eifel, Germany during my holidays last year. When I was there we had 2 very clear nights and 2 nights with some high clouds. I decided to go for a dark nebula as these are impossible to image from where I live.\r\n\r\nThis image shows the Shark Nebula (LDN1235) in the constellation of Cepheus. This is a nice cloud of gas and dust which is highlighted by the light of nearby stars.\r\n\r\nTelescope: TMB92 @ f/5.5\r\nCamera: QSI583ws\r\nMount: Skywatcher EQ6\r\n\r\nExposures:\r\nL: 53 x 600s\r\nR: 9 x 600s\r\nG: 9 x 600s\r\nB: 9 x 600s\r\n\r\nTotal 13,3 hours",
