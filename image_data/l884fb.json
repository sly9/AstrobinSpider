    "description": "IC 342 is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Camelopardalis, located relatively close to the Milky Way. Despite its large apparent size and actual high brightness, its location in dusty areas near the galactic equator makes it difficult to observe, leading to the nickname \"The Hidden Galaxy\". If the galaxy were not obscured, it would be visible by eye. The dust makes it difficult to determine its precise distance from Earth, estimates range from about 7 to 11 million light years.\nImaged in LRGB on our CDK 14 telescope at SRO, Auberry, California.\nSystem control: Voyager Astrophotography Automation by Leonardo Orazi\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\nSRO Group : Mike Selby, John Kasianowicz, Rick Stevenson, Walter Lickteig.",
