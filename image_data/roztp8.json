    "description": "In between Orion's belt are several smaller dust clouds that have always interested me, and I've wanted to shoot just them for a few years now.  We tried it out with the CDK rig, and while it did come out, Mintaka, Alnitak and Alnilam were still making their presence known in the image.  Difficult to process out, this gets the image to 90% of where I had imagined it, hope you enjoy and the big boys don't detract too much!",
