    "description": "M100:  Similar in appearance to our own Milky Way, Messier 100 is a grand spiral galaxy that presents an intricate structure, with a bright core and two prominent arms. The galaxy harbours numerous young and hot massive stars as well as extremely hot regions of ionised hydrogen. Two smaller arms are seen emerging from the centre and reaching towards the larger spiral arms. The galaxy, located 60 million light-years away, is slightly larger than the Milky Way, with a diameter of about 120,000 light-years. A supernova was discovered in M100 on 4 February 2006. Named SN 2006X, it is the 5th supernova to have been found in M100 since 1900.\r\n\r\n52 Light subs @180s gain 100 and -15째C\r\n\r\n20 Blue subs @180s gain 100 and -15째C\r\n16 Green subs @180s gain 100 and -15째C\r\n20 Red subs @180s gain 100 and -15째C\r\n\r\nTotal exposure = 5.4 hours",
