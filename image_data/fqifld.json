    "description": "During public outreach presentations, I typically use the Running Chicken nebula as the butt of a joke, since people typically ask me where the name of such objects come from.  I personally have never been able to imagine a chicken in this nebula (even widerfield images), but am pleased that it's a beautiful nebula to process!\r\n\r\nThanks to Greg Turgeon for sending me data when my own obsy is down due to weather!",
