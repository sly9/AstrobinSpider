    "description": "M96 lies about 35 million light years away in Leo.   The bright inner core is slightly displaced from the outer extended halo.   This asymmetric nature hints at past gravitational interactions with neighbors.   The inner core is significantly brighter than the outer diffuse arms and a more notable feature is the bright blue ring of starburst activity that surrounds this core.  \r\n\r\nOne interesting aspect of this image is the appearance of a sizable edge-on background galaxy situated behind M96â€™s faint arm (near the top of the galaxy in this image).   This galaxy is 15-20 times more distant by some estimates and shines bright enough to be clearly seen through the foreground stars and dust.  \r\n\r\nThis image was a long time in the making.   The RGB data needed a lot of help, but the weather was not allowing me to capture more.   So, at some point I called it off and processed what I had.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
