    "description": "I was stargazing the past two weeks at Namibia with my friends. We created so many astrophotos and timelapses, and landscape astrophotos.\r\n\r\nThis is my first photo from a faraway world. ( 12000km distance from my location ). The Milky Way is so bright, it casts shadows... \r\n\r\nI dont need much postprocess method. Some curves, and the image was finished.",
