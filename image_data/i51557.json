    "description": "This is a 10 image blend from a video I captured of the Hubble Space Telescope transiting Jupiter. I had several opportunities to capture transits of both Jupiter and Saturn over a six day period  and this was the best.  \r\nI was totally devastated to miss capturing the Saturn transit because I was late pressing record on my main camera by about 1 second !   (I did capture video of it on a wide angle DSLR though).\r\n\r\nWith Calsky's prediction service no longer working I used Heaven's Above for the initial \"tip-off\"  that the HST was in my neighbourhood, then Stellarium / Google Earth to fine tune the shooting location.\r\n\r\nThe transit video was captured with a 10\" F4 Newtonian, Televue Powermate 2x, ASI1600MM Pro (Luminance filter) and SharpCap.  RGB captured immediately afterward.",
