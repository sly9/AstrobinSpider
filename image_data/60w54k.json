    "description": "This is a bicolor image of the Elephant Trunk Nebula IC 1396, a beautiful emission nebula in the constellation of Cepheus. Although it's one of the more often photographed objects its surface brightness is actually fairly low compared to other popular nebulae.\r\nEspecially the OIII Channel was difficult to get and required to image from a darker, less lightpolluted location on a moonless night.\r\nThis is the first full project with my new telescope, the TS 76EDPH 6-element flatfield APO and the Astronomik 12nm narrowband filters.\r\nMaybe I will add some SII data later on and create another image with a different colour palette.\r\nA respectable part of the imaging and processing was done together with my astronomy friends and colleges Julian Zoller and Miriam Varding.\r\n\r\nThe main goal in terms of aesthetics was to create a very dark and cold atmosphere highlighting the transparency and glow of ionized cosmic gas, as I don't like the common impression of narrowband images that make you feel like \"looking against a wall of colors\" neglecting that those objects are actually very dilute.\r\n\r\nFeel free to like, comment and share.\r\nCS Jan",
