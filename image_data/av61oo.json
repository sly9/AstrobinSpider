    "description": "4 Panel Mosaic of a LOT of galaxies in and around Markarian's Chain. Doing a plate solve in PixInsight it found 2021 PGC galaxies. Here I marked this up showing the 12 Messier objects in the field of view. I will be adding the full size version as a revision. (I had to save it fairly compressed to get the filesize down). It is a little noisy but it was a fun target to shoot.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftware used to capture image:\r\nSequence Generator Pro\r\nPHD2\r\n\r\nSoftware used to edit:\r\nPixInsight\r\nPhotoshop\r\n\r\nTotal data gathered:\r\n(396) Lum @ 120secs - 1x1\r\n(80) R @ 240secs - 1x1\r\n(77) G @ 240secs - 1x1\r\n(76) B @ 240secs - 1x1\r\n\r\nCamera : QHY600 with Readout mode 0 and Gain set to 26 with Offset at 76.\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ-106EDX4\r\nMount: AP Mach1GTO",
