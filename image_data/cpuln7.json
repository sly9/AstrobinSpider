    "description": "My second and final C/2020 F3 Neowise image. This was my first time shooting a comet with a mono camera and filter wheel. I was running out of time and didn't get as much exposure as hoped. Constant passing cirrus clouds didn't help.\r\n\r\nThere are some stacking artifacts and some noise that I gave up trying to fix. In the end I'm pleased but the next time a comet comes around, I'll give it another try.",
