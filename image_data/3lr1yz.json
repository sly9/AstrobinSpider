    "description": "Looking back at my <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/6ga6ri/\">Hercules Cluster of Galaxies</a> project, I wondered if there may be something similar in the July sky with good positioning?\r\n\r\nFortunately there is! And Adam Block has a great reference point <a href=\"http://www.caelumobservatory.com/gallery/n6340.shtml\">NGC6340 in 32-inch Schulman Telescope</a>.\r\n\r\nAfter scanning the area a bit, I noticed there's a lot going on. (-:\r\n\r\nThis is one of my deepest images under very steady skies. 17 hours of Luminance in a 21.5 average SQM sky with 68 15-minute subs between 1.69\" and 2.55\" FWHM. The 2x Drizzle stacked result is 2.22\" FWHM and the deconvolved result 1.62\" FWHM.\r\n\r\nThe circular NGC 6340 is 55 million light years distant. IC 1251, IC 1254 and UGC 10791 are all about the same distance. \r\n\r\nMaybe someone can find something 1 billion+ light years distant? I believe we can see at least 24 magnitude objects here. (-:",
