    "description": "This is an interesting part of the sky located in the constellation of Cepheus.  Numerous  objects make up the shark nebula shape.  Going from left to right, the dark nebula LDN 1235 makes up the shark's snout.  Directly to the right, vdb150 is the bright bluish reflection nebula which is where the shark's ears would be if it had them.  Directly below is vdB 149, another bright bluish reflection nebula at the shark's pectoral fin.  Galaxy PGC 67671 is located above and to the right of the dorsal fin.  Finally, galaxy PGC 67347 is located just below the tail.  \r\n\r\nThis area is dense with clouds of dust, causing halos to appear around each of the brighter stars, and causing the galaxies to appear yellowish in color.  I am amazed that the actual large orange-hued dust cloud which is the main attraction here does not appear to have a formal named designation.\r\n\r\nLike most other faint dark nebulae, this was an extremely difficult object to process.  The subs, even luminance, showed hardly any definition.",
