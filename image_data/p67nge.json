    "description": "Mars on the morning of Mon 27 Apr 2020 AEST.\r\n\r\nAfter 90 minute Jupiter session I switched to the Red Planet to capture this view of a very messy looking Syrtis Major.  There is quite a lot of activity in and around the Hellas Basin with a yellow tinge indicative of dust events.  The Chevron shaped feature extends northward into Syrtis Major, many fine details are resolved.  Large ice cap surrounds the South Pole.\r\n\r\nDerotation of seven stacks combining 40,000 frames recorded between 5:08 and 5:36 am Canberra time.  Fog clouds arrived shortly afterwards.  To improve image aesthetics I have surgically removed edge rind artefact and matched the colour with my latest capture from the 5th May.",
