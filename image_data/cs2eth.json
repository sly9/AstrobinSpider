    "description": "This is my first light image with DSNM observatory. Deeply impressed by the results!\r\n\r\nWe have a side by side setup, FSQ106 and TOA130, each with a ASI6200mm-p. For this image, I used TOA130 for the Lum channel and FSQ106 for RGB, their focal length is almost 2:1, so it's more like a \"natural BIN2\".\r\n\r\nOh, btw, the new capturing software Voyage is also amazing, it runs 2 scopes flawlessly. Auto-focusing/dithering all in sync. I love the robostar focus method 100%.\r\n\r\nHope you like it!\r\n<I>#TeamNoctuaDSNM</I>",
