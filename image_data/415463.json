    "description": "Continuing to work out some different image plans with the DCT. We spent a lot of time on planning this shot together when going through different targets that would fit well within the telescope. We also experimented with luminance for this image by substituting an unbinned VR filter. Definitely a benefit, and something I hope they continue to utilize in the future.\r\n\r\nThe equipment is scientific, so it isn't made for pretty pictures. Tons and tons of artifacts to remove, especially with such low integration time. A fair trade off though for the quality I think :) \r\n\r\nThese results made use of the Lowell Observatoryâ€™s Discovery Channel Telescope",
