    "description": "This is a wide-angle view of Sharpless 119 (Sh2-119), a large emission nebula covering about three degrees of the sky in the constellation Cygnus. My previous posting of Sh2-119 focused on the Bok globules and dark dust lanes of the object using a traditional HST palette (https://www.astrobin.com/421855/?nc=user). In this rendition, I am showing the entire nebula using much of the same narrowband data, but here with a combination of the three channels that yields a more “natural” color representation. Since the OIII data for this project were very poor, the perimeter of most frames blown out by light from the full Moon, I mixed the much stronger SII data with the OIII to retain structure in both the green and blue channels. After a fair amount of trial and error in PI Pixel Math, I was able to salvage a reasonable image if Sh2-119.\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\nVan McComas astutely observed that the structure of this nebula, with the very light OIII signal in the core, gives the appearance of looking through a window at the cosmos beyond. So, since this object does not have a common name, how about we call it Window Nebula?",
