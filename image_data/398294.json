    "description": "Ganymede the greatest of the Galileans!\r\nA photomontage of two separate sockets, just watch the capture times. In the first one with a bigger field to show the exact position of Ganymede in relation to Jupiter. In the second a Close exclusively in Ganymede with a resize of 350%.\r\nNext, a print extracted from the Virtual Planet Atlas at the exact time of capture shows that albedo stains are real, not artifacts caused by the large increase or processing employed.\r\nClose to the opposition if seeing helps, I will certainly get more details of Jupiter's largest satellite.",
