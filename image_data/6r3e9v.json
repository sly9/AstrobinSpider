    "description": "So pleased to have finally caught some loop proms for an animation!  It appears we are seeing them edge on in this 20 minute animation in real time.  Found out later this is a post flare loop from the biggest flare recorded in more than 3 years  by Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory as reported here on Spaceweather:     https://www.spaceweather.com",
