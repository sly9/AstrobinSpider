    "description": "Please find my last try to shoot M101 with my 250mm Newton\r\nA very famous galaxy with always the same framing ...\r\nSo after many versions of different framings and crops, I finaly get  this square framing with vertical rotation (north is left) which I like particularly : I think that we can see more the spreading arms and the small galaxies around  are placed to be remarked.\r\nOne little galaxy can be seen just above one arm at the top, and a galaxy group near NGC5471\r\n\r\nIt takes me 4 nights to complete the subs :  15/16, 26/27, 27/28 of february and 03/03 of march\r\n\r\nLight 103 subs@180s \r\nRed 30subs@180s \r\nBlue 30subs@180s \r\nGreen 30subs@180s \r\nHalpha 21subs@300s\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time with pixinsight to get the best possible with the subs  I had.\r\nI wanted to get more Halpha subs but the weather is turning bad , so I decided to have a try anyway.\r\n\r\nThis time I also was more gentle with the saturation slider  :-) to get a more natural feeling and colors of the galaxy .  A specific process was done to reduce the star halos and to keep the color as well...\r\n\r\nTell me what you think",
