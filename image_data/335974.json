    "description": "This is a LRGB normal color image of IC1396, which also called the Elephant's Trunk Nebula because of the shape of the nebula's center. Even through people usually use narrowband filter to shot this target but I like the natural color of wideband filters. The FOV of my gear can just cover the whole target. IC1396 is one of the largest emission nebulae in the Northern Sky with a diameter of 3 degrees. It is a giant cloud of gas and dust at a distance of 2400 light years from Earth.",
