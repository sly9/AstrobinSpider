    "description": "An Aptonym for the ages\r\n\r\nIn what was surely fodder for good humored jokes among his peers, astronomer Stewart Sharpless studied galactic nebulae in our galaxy. This image shows two early entries in a catalogue that bears his name:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.adamblockphotos.com/sh2-1.html\r\n\r\nThe humor is found in the fact that he studied things that are truly \"sharpless.\" These clouds of amorphous gas are faint and diffuse. The bright star near the top left is Delta Scorpii (the southwestern star in the head of Scorpius) and surrounding it are the red glowing clouds of gas that comprise Sh2-7. Near the bottom of the frame is the smaller and brighter cavity of Sh2-1 (the first entry in the catalogue).",
