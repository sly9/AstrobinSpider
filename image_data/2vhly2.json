    "description": "IC410 The Tadpole Nebula\r\n\r\nIC410 is a dusty emission nebula located in the constellation of Auriga at about 12,000 light-years from Earth. The gas structures in this picture are lit by the radiation from the open star cluster NGC1893 that lies in the center of the nebula. To the lower left of the center of this picture, two dense structures are visible. These are similar to the famous Pillar of Creation and they are composed of dust and gas left over from the formation of the star cluster and are very likely to give birth to more stars in the future. As can be seen in the picture, these structures point away from the center of the nebula. This is because of the stellar winds and radiation pressure from the stars in NGC 1893.",
