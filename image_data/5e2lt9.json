    "description": "Shot in a brief window of clear weather on the evening of January 4th, the \"Heart Nebula\" is a glowing mass of hydrogen gas found within the constellation of Cassiopeia. Two clusters of young stars are imbedded within this region of stellar birth. Found close to 7500 light years away, dark lanes of dust crisscross the nebula. The image was taken from my observatory with the ASI294 camera on a RASA 8 telescope and is compiled from a series of two-minute sub-exposures over a period of 1.5 hours.",
