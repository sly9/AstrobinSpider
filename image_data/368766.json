    "description": "Still reviewing the unprocessed movies that I make in the rush through work, sometimes I find real jewelry.\r\nThis Saturn shows very well several characteristics of the ring senhou, and what I like immensely, is the comparison between the photo in the visible wave band (RGB) and the infrared photo 685 nanometers.\r\nUnbelievable to see how the polar hexagon and its eye stand out in the infrared, although they are present tenuously in the color photo, it is in the infrared that it gains evidence and perfectly shows its hexagonal form.",
