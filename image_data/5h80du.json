    "description": "The goal was to get the arms as long as possible (you can see some small galaxies at extremities ) \r\nand the possible detail in the arms\r\nFor this version ; I try to keep the natural aspect  (keeping saturation at a low level)\r\nM74 finally looks like a small M101 \r\n\r\n\r\nWiki :\r\nMessier 74 (also known as NGC 628 and Phantom Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Pisces. It is at a distance of about 32 million light-years away from Earth. The galaxy contains two clearly defined spiral arms and is therefore used as an archetypal example of a grand design spiral galaxy.  It is estimated that M74 is home to about 100 billion stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n70 Light subs @180s gain zero and -15째C and\r\n\r\n20 Blue subs @180s gain zero and -10째C\r\n20 Green subs @180s gain zero and -10째C\r\n20 Red subs @180s gain zero and -10째C\r\n\r\nTotal exposure 7 hours",
