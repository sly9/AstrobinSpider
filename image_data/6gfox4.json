    "description": "This is a narrowband image of the Heart Nebula processed using an SHO color palette.  I used a full frame mono sensor and filter wheel mounted on a 130mm APO refractor with a reducer to produce an equivalent focal length of 585mm.   There are approximately 22 600 second frames in each of the  Ha, OIII and SII bands collected over a three night period.  Processing was performed in PixInsight and then adjusted to taste in Photoshop.",
