    "description": "I captured Ha data on the Horsehead nebula over a week ago.  But I still wanted a color image of it with this telescope before I switch back to wide field imaging.  I had a small window last night to capture OIII data and only managed 32 minutes, but adding it to Ha, it was enough to  give me that color Horsehead.  Now I'd like to capture it with my wide field scope and use my LRGB filters.",
