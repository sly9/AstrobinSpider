    "description": "Here is my first astrophotography feat! I have spend hundreds and hundreds hours for the traitement, searching for the best workflow, adjusting minutely each parameters. Then I finally finished and reach the best own satisfaction and say nothing more to add nore to change ... until now ;-)\r\nThe book Inside PixInsight from Warren A. Keller helps me a lot (I highly recommended it), mostly to improve masks but I smooth more recommended parameters.\r\nI abandoned my Nikon D5600 for a ZWO 1600MM-C and I see how much I improve quality image and treatment. Now I see beautiful colors! With D5600 colors were pretty poor. I improve very well my collimation now I have very few elongated stars.\r\nYou know this popular the triangulum galaxy, no need to had a copy paste description ;-)\r\nI dream a lot looking this picture, comparing this galaxy to our thinking where can we be, how many details we can see, findind tiny galaxies and looking big and small nebulae.\r\nNext step for 2018, a great H-Alpha session\r\nEnjoy, share, like and dream\r\n\r\nA special thank to Tommy Nawratil from teleskop-austria for all his advices and great products (dewheater, telescope and M-Gen Lacerta)",
