    "description": "With Jupiter now higher in the sky I made 9 runs of 1 minute per colour channel.\r\nThere is a discontinuous dark band in the NNTeB. To its south in the NEBn, there is a small dark red barge, although it is almost circular. The festoons in the north part of the EZ are subdued compared to the other side of the planet.\r\nThe complex wake of the GRS is very turbulent and the GRS is somewhat misshapen, although it may be a visual effect due to the shape of the thick band of dark red material to the north. The RSH is almost nonexistent to the south and there is a band and finger of grey coloured material protruding into the STrZ, where it seems to take on a more blue colour. The colour is quite different to the more normal light green hue on the f side and north of the GRS.\r\nThe chimney to the north of GRS remains open and connects to a green-grey band in the SEBn.",
