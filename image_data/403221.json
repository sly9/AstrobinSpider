    "description": "There wasn't much happening on the surface of the sun today, so I inverted the texture  to try and give it a little more pop.  I usually don't like inverting the sun because it turns sunspots from black to white and flares from white to black.  But I didn't have to worry about that today.\r\n\r\nOne of these days I'm going to learn how to do mosaics because the ASI183MM camera is still bringing me in too close.",
