    "description": "Yves Van den Broek captured these 32 panels with his remote setup, which I host at Les Granges. (Tak FSQ106 reduced, Mesu 200, Full Frame QHY CMOS OSC camera.) He also put the panels together in APP. This produced a good template but a very unsatisfactory blend. Yves then handed me the template and the raw files. I slightly  altered the geometry of the template to reduce  final cropping and then processed the original subs in PI and Photoshop, using a recorded initial stretch action for consistency and speed. I used Registar to build up these subs onto the template. Further stretching was done to the whole image in Ps.  The Squid Nebula and one or two other details came from my existing data, calibrated in Registar and blended in Ps. Great fun. This processig took about a working week, including the inevitable false starts!\r\n\r\nSo... lots going on in Cepheus. It's not great for the visual observers but you can see why we imagers  love it.\r\n\r\nA big thanks to Yves for giving me the chance to get involved in another very large mosaic. I was knocked out by the camera. I've never been an OSC fan till this time. There are no Ha filtered  subs in this.",
