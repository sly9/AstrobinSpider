    "description": "This image is a 2 panel mosaic with the goal of bringing out the surrounding dust near M45.  I was careful to correctly color balance the image which resulted in a bit of reddish purple near M45.  I'm guessing it's a mix of a little H-alpha and reflection nebula?  The dust around the center of M45 lost a little detail due to the agressive stretching elsewhere.  Startools can leave some halos around brighter stars with the stretching mode I used.   Exposures were kept short at 50s and each panel had 120 exposures.  It took quite a long time for APP to finally spit out a final stacked mosaic on my 4 core computer.",
