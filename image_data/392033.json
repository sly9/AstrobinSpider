    "description": "Encompassing five NGC objects, NGCs 2237, 2238, 2239, 2244, 2246, the Rosette is one of my top 5 favorite objects.  But shooting at 2563mm I was forced to use a four panel mosaic.  The mosaic was stitched using the PS CC automate photomerge command.  Pre-processing was in CCDStack to produce the four panel masters that were finished fully in PS CC.\r\n\r\n221 twenty minute subs for a total of 73.7 hours.  79 Ha, 66 OIII, 76 SII.  I would like to have added more time in some of the panels but the season is coming to a close and roof open time is fleeting this Winter.\r\n\r\nThe color mix is straight SHO.  I may try some alternate mixes down the road.\r\n\r\nEDIT 30.12.2019:  Added new data and re-processed completely.  My goal was to get the noise and quality up so I can do a large print for my home.  For this version SHO master panels were joined in PS and then the Ha channel was used for luminance.",
