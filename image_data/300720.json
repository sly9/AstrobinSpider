    "description": "I've finally managed to put my dual rig together.  It is 2xWO Star 71s and 2 x Moravian G2-8300 cameras.  I have a Chroma 3nm filter in one of the cameras and decided to go for a 5nm Astrodon in the other.  This is Ha data from both cameras - 8 x 20 minutes from each.  \r\n\r\nI am going to try for SII and OIII to go with it, but I was keen to see if the rig was functional.  Of course with the 3nm and 5 nm, just a quick stretch ended up showing a reasonable result.  ",
