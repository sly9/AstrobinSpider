    "description": "An unusual target giving a result that I feel quite ambivalent about.  I processed this twice and am somewhat underwhelmed with the result.  Even Wikipedia shares my dissatisfaction with only a measly \"NGC 1491 is a bright nebula in the constellation of Perseus. It is also known as LBN 704.\" as its entry.  It has an intriguing inner bright ribbon of emissions but has only reluctantly yielded some further structural detail.  Perhaps we suffered a little poor seeing, maybe we need more FL.   A slight crop to aid the framing.\r\n\r\nThe image has sat on my hard drive for the last four weeks while I caught up on processing and deliberated what to do with it.  I tried a CHFT palette but that didn't help either.  Ho hum.\r\n\r\nCS!\r\n\r\nData acquitision: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne.\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson, all my own fault ;-)",
