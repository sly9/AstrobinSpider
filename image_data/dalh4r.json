    "description": "A Horse, of course, of course:\n\nHere is the beautiful region near Nu Scorpii.\n\nI am still collecting images of the nebulae in this unique part of the sky and this is one I have never taken a widefield image of. I attempted to acquire data on this last year and spent more time on it this year. I didn't publish last year's attempt because there were too many issues with the data. However, this year a new processing tool became available that permitted me to salvage the data and add more.\n\nThe bluish reflection nebula around the \"eye\" of this horse head is IC 4592. IC4601 is the other reflection nebula. You can see an image I took of it more than a decade ago here:\nhttp://www.caelumobservatory.com/gallery/ic4601.shtml\nI hope you enjoy the view. (I am pretty certain Alan Young would. ðŸ™‚ )",
