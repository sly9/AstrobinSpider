    "description": "This is my second try on NGC 6188. Quite a big project but still unfinished. It was supposed to be 100 hours of total integration time, 33 hours per channel, but the weather didn't help much and winter season was almost ending when I started it. I plan finishing it next year though, if not a whole new project on it, again..........",
