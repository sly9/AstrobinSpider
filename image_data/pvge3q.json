    "description": "This object is so faint, it is painful.  After stacking 47 hours of Hα (188 x 900s) and 16.25 hours of OIII (65 x 900s), I tried and failed to complete an image.  After a second failed attempt, I accepted as a lesson learned that my upstate NY sky is too bright and hazy for such a faint object.  Then I started playing with the files while watching an old black & white movie on TCM.  I was thinking about new technologies in cinematography and how they have redirected the art of making movies – for good and for bad.  Perhaps it was the fresh perspective of a by-gone medium or simply trying not to do too much with my evening, but when the movie was over, my laptop showed an image that I chose not to reject.\r\n\r\nCTB 1 is a supernova remnant (SNR) in the constellation Cassiopeia and a source of optical, radio, and X-ray emissions.  A recent study reports that a pulsar was born from the supernova that produced CTB 1 and ejected into the galaxy, traveling at a velocity exceeding 1000 km/s.\r\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab18f7\r\nhttps://aasnova.org/2019/05/20/featured-image-a-runaway-pulsar/\r\nhttps://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190813.html\r\n\r\nThe filaments in the lower left corner of my image may be related to a separate SNR.\r\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full/2005/19/aa2187-04/aa2187-04.right.html#figure429\r\n\r\nIn addition to Hα and OIII for the overall image, I collected RGB for the star colors.\r\nI hope you like the result.",
