    "description": "\"Vikings in a boat\". That's what I see in that pic. This is the last one of my astroholiday in France and the toughest one. When I saw this object the first time on an image, I fell in love with it. These tubes are incredible and the whole appearence is breathtaking in my eyes. With the raw material I had several issues with strong gradients and deformed stars. So I tried my best with processing here. I am really glad that I got it in my holiday and hope you like it too...\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
