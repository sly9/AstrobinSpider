    "description": "Recent work in Cygnus- still working towards a 6 panel mosaic of the Loop.  I have been shooting the Hydrogen and Oxygen data from Chattanooga while shooting my LRGB data from Marathon remotely.  I've been using a 3nm Hydrogen and a 6nm Oxygen filter to do my work.  Results have been pleasing to me.  \r\n\r\nI hope to add a 3nm Oxygen filter soon.  \r\n\r\nThanks for looking-  Details: \r\n\r\nImage statistics: \r\nL- 20 x 180s\r\nR- 20 x 180s\r\nG- 20 x 180s\r\nB- 20 x 180s \r\nHA- 20 x 600s \r\nO3- 20 x 600s\r\n\r\nMaking it around 10.5 hours per panel at present. Image acquired during July and August in Marathon Texas and Chattanooga, TN.",
