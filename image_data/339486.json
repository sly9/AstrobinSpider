    "description": "M31N 2008-12a is a remarkable recurrent nova within the Andromeda Galaxy. \r\n\r\nI searched the internet for images of this Nova but just found a yellowish image with low definition. So, I suppose this image is unique. It was then that I decided to try alternative processing.\r\n\r\n*****************\r\n\r\nWith eleven eruptions now identified, including eight in the past eight years, the system exhibits a recurrence period of one year, and possibly just six months. \r\n\r\nThis short inter eruption period is driven by the combination of a high mass white dwarf (1.38 MSun) and high mass accretion rate. Such a high accretion rate appears to be provided by the stellar wind of a red giant companion. \r\n\r\nDeep Hα observations have revealed the presence of a vastly extended nebula around the system, which could be the ‘super-remnant’ of many thousands of past eruptions. \r\n\r\nWith a prediction of the white dwarf reaching the Chandrasekhar mass soon, M31N 2008-12a has become the leading pre-explosion type Ia supernova candidate.\r\n\r\nMore information by M. J. Darnley can be found here: <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01301.pdf\"> arXiv.org</a> (Nov./2016).\r\n\r\nRecent updated analysis predicts that the M31N 2008-12a white dwarf could reach the Chandrasekhar mass in < 20 kyr. More information here: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10145\"> arXiv.org</a> (Set./2017).\r\n\r\nSee Nova's location in here:\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/332454/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/332454/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
