    "description": "This object is a barred spiral galaxy located 7000 light years away in the northern constellation of Draco.   The low Caldwell number is an indication that it lies far north.  I had low expectations of this object prior to and while imaging.  Very little is written about it in the literature. It is faint and diffuse, making it a very difficult visual object.  But in an image, I find this galaxy to be fantastic.\r\n\r\nI am puzzled and fascinated by the dominance of bright orange stars throughout the foreground of the image which frame the galaxy.  I am also fascinated by the bright blue consistent color of the galaxy.  The contrast of the orange foreground stars and the blue background galaxy is striking.   A number of faint spiral arms are barely visible, fading as they extend out from the core.  Several faint galaxies are seen in the background.",
