    "description": "This object is quite easy to process if you have enough photons ;-). \r\nI booked a refractor with F/D=5.6 at Roboscopes (Pier 7) hosted at e-Eye but an instrument with f/D = 4 would have been much better. Nevertheless 3h of Ha and 3h of OIII with 900s subs were enough to get out most of this nebula which is not a PN. If you have a fast instrument, I don't think that you need more than 10h to get all the details of it, including the faint Ha veils around.",
