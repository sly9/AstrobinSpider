    "description": "IC1318C (LBN245), image centered on the blue A0 star HD195255, next to the orange-red M2-4 variable star RW Cygni. The nebulosity of the star to the lower left also befuddles me as I can find next to nothing about it- a lesson in the comments would be appreciated. I did find in his Photographic Studies of Nebulae IV (1924), John C. Duncan mentions this nebulosity and that he may be the first to describe it; this is as far as I've gotten with the mystery.",
