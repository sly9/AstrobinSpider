    "description": "<p>Due to a combination of travel and hectic work commitments, I've fallen drastically behind on my image processing. </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Didn't make a lot of sense to spam Astrobin with a series of similar images so, to quote a movie lyric by Trey Parker: <em>we're gonna need a montage!</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the \"warts and all\" spirit, I have included a mix of imaging conditions and data quality. I have also kept the processing similar between images, so that the differences you see will be primarily data quality.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On many of the nights there was a gusty breeze, unusual here (unless it's about to rain). For the images in mid to late July, this was causing an extreme amount of image shake and is actually the primary reason for the blurring in these images. I eventually realised the screws for the adapter plate on my iOptron tri-pier had worked themselves slightly loose, compromising the rigidity of the mount assembly. The situation was much improved for the final session in this series.</p>  \r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.astrobin.com/421712/0/'>Rev A: Montage of three imaging sessions</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Upon loading the images into Astrobin, I realised I had (quite accidentally) captured almost identical aspects of Jupiter on the 4th, 16th and 21st July. This allowed me to create a montage (and animation below) illustrating the relative motion of Jupiter's cloud formations over that 2.5 week period.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.astrobin.com/421712/B/'>Rev B: animation of the above montage</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>For a higher quality animation in the APNG format, <a href='https://www.cloudynights.com/uploads/gallery/album_11724/gallery_285172_11724_244507.png' target='_blank'>click here</a>. Do note APNG is not supported by all browsers (Internet Explorer in particular).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.astrobin.com/421712/C/'>Rev C: 2019-07-04 15:11 UT</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Probably the sharpest of the images, taken before my mount shake issue manifested (and before I installed Bob's knobs, which I suspect are causing a separate issue).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also like the way the two white ovals and dark raft (directly south of the GRS) makes it look like someone is playing a game of \"break out\" with the clouds in the SEB.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.astrobin.com/421712/D/'>Rev D: 2019-07-07 13:37 UT</a></strong>\r\nAt the beginning of this session I was only able to complete a handful of 90s runs before clouds moved in. As such, the detail is good but the noise is higher than ideal.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.astrobin.com/421712/E/'>Rev E: 2019-07-07 14:40 UT</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>An image from later in the session above, after the worst of the clouds had passed. I was still dodging clouds and transparency was variable, hence the drop in detail. </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.astrobin.com/421712/F/'>Rev F: 2019-07-16 15:04 UT</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>This imaging session was memorable due to the dark blue, almost black eddy of clouds in the turbulent wake of the GRS (to the NW of the GRS itself). So dark was this eddy that his feature was immediately obvious in the raw data ... I initially worried it was dust on the sensor!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another interesting feature in this image is the combination of clouds that looks for all the world like a lower case letter \"a\" (in the northern polar region, almost directly north of the GRS).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.astrobin.com/421712/G/'>Rev G: 2019-07-19 15:40 UT</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.astrobin.com/421712/H/'>Rev H: 2019-07-21 14:14 UT</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>A pleasing amount of detail evident in this image, including a \"c\" shaped fine line of darker cloud in the GRS.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.astrobin.com/421712/I/'>Rev I: 2019-07-27 14:33 UT</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>This was the session that was most severely impacted by the mount vibration.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.astrobin.com/421712/J/'>Rev J: 2019-07-29 14:44 UT</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href='https://www.astrobin.com/421712/K/'>Rev K: 2019-08-01 14:58 UT</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>OK, I snuck one image from August in as well ...  ;)  Nice to capture Oval BA for a change, and I had identified and fixed my mount vibration issue by this time. </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em style='font-size:x-small'>Always fade out at the end of a montage ...</em></p>\r\n<p><em style='font-size:xx-small'>If you fade out it will seem like more time has passed in a montage ...</em></p>",
