    "description": "Lately I've been mostly fine tuning my telescope and mount, but night after night of testing I collected almost 10 more hours of Running Chicken, so I decided to re edit IC2944  with the new data. I re done both the SHO and the HOO version, and I think  this one is worth uploading as a new work. \r\nThe main difference with the original is the improvement in texture and detail that logically comes with more integration. I urge you to explore it in Full resolution.\r\n\r\nIn any case hope you're all safe, and imaging the Cosmos.\r\nClear skies!\r\n\r\nD",
