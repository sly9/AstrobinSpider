    "description": "Finally finding some time to go back and process more images of the aurora I was fortunate enough to witness whilst on holiday in Finland.\r\n\r\nThis image precedes <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/nhfvyg/I/\" target=\"_blank\">the image I last posted</a>, and illustrates my comment the it seemed like the sky was on fire - the entire northern half of the sky was alight at some stages. The hazy clouds had not yet quite cleared at this time, however, blurring the details somewhat.\r\n\r\nRev H shows a time lapse for this period, composed from 52 separate images. I intended to capture a longer sequence, but cut it short when I noticed a river of light dancing almost directly overhead. (Will post that image shortly.) \r\n\r\nSome alignment and cropping was required this time, due to the camera and tripod settling into the soft powder snow ... a useful learning, which I applied in my subsequent captures.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
