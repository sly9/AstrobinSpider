    "description": "Sharpless-96 (Sh2-96) is part of a giant ancient super nova remnant designated G65.3+5.7 located in the constellation Cygnus the Swan approximately 2500 light-years distant. I processed a SHO version this past summer and decided to play with the data processing a more natural HOO version. The stars where processed in SHO and then color shifted to make them look more natural. Even with my short focal length of my Stellarvue SV70T with a reducer, I was still only able to capture part of it. It would require a really short focal length DSLR lens to get the whole super nova structure, which is over four degrees in diameter. This portion, Sh2-96, however is the most interesting part to me. Other parts include designations of Sh2-91 and Sh2-94, which are out of the field of view. Because of how old and dispersed the nebulosity is, it is very faint. I did not pick up any nebulosity in a single sub, so not many attempt it for obvious reasons. I had to really massage the data to get where I wanted it. It reminds me of CTB-1 (Abell 85) meets the Veil Nebula, which makes sense because they are super nova remnants as well.",
