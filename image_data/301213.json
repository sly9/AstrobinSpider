    "description": "NGC5850 (barred spiral on the left) and NGC5846 (the large elliptical on the right) are an attractive and close pairing in Virgo.   NGC5845 is the smaller elliptical on the right edge.   NGC5850 is deceivingly faint in the outer reaches with very low surface brightness.    I really wanted to get better color in these areas but that's not going to happen this year.   \r\n\r\nI started a bit late in the season on this.  It crosses the meridian around twilight, so it was a race against time to collect these subs and had to do it across many nights.   This is another one of those targets that would soak up all the integration you give it.   I processed the image as a snapshot of where I was, because its getting to be obstructed for me and this is it for the year.   \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n",
