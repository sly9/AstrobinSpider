    "description": "When I went outside to image I had no clue what I was going to image.  The sky for a change\r\nwas relatively dark but I knew I would be racing a full Moon rising.   I looked around for a\r\nfew minutes and decided I would try to get a better image of NGC 6960.   I intended on taking\r\nas many images as I could before the Moon reared it's head.   I managed to get 30 usable\r\nimages but with image number 19 the images began to get brighter with each image.  By the\r\ntime I got to the 26th image a full Moon was up in all its glory.   I've been kind of mad at the \r\nMoon for the past several days but tonight when I saw it rise it was magnificent.  It had the\r\nprettiest yellow/orange color.    I should have gone inside and got my other dslr and tried to\r\nget a photo of the Moon.   Sorry guys once I start talking I never know when to stop.   Please\r\nenjoy my latest image of NGC 6960.",
