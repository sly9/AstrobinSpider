    "description": "Rarely imaged area in Taurus.\r\n\r\nSmall blue nebula on the left is VdB 29, which is illuminated by star HD 30378.  Haven't found much information on it, but I can speculate that the mechanism of its formation is the same as that of the Peiades' nebulosity - apparently group of stars is just passing through some dust clouds. (BTW, those three blue stars on the left all move in the same direction)\r\n\r\nThis FOV also contains a high proper motion star LHS 1698. Revision C shows its motion using blue plates from POSSI, POSSII, and B channel from our data. I measured about 50\" of travel distance between Dec 1954 and Feb 2018, which gives velocity of about 800 mas/year, which is consistent with available <a href=\"http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=LHS++1698&NbIdent=1\">data</a>.",
