    "description": "The Crescent Nebula is an emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus, about 5000 light-years away from Earth. It is formed by the fast stellar wind from the Wolf-Rayet star WR 136 (HD 192163) colliding with and energizing the slower moving wind ejected by the star when it became a red giant around 250,000 to 400,000 years ago. (Source Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nI am starting to get the hang of the new setup. I was planning to move back to my wide field refractor, but I am finding it hard to dismantle the current gear, this field of view is hard to let go :) \r\n\r\nHere is my version of the Crescent nebula in HOO, I hope you like it! Comments and feedback are appreciated!\r\n\r\nClear skies and stay safe!",
