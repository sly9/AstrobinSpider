    "description": "Interesting Galaxy, but what really stands out are the myriad smaller galaxies in the background, especially the beautiful huge cluster in the upper left. Its also worthwhile to take the time to explore the  many gorgeous double and triple stars evident throughout. \r\n\r\nNote that this is the first of a new set of images where I have gone back to doing unbinned Luminance set and 2x2 binned RGB sets.",
