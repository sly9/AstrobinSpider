    "description": "It has taken many weeks to collect the data between main projects and winter weather storms that have swept across Europe.  In fact we started acquiring the data on 30th November and only concluded on the 4th April.  We would have captured more but for the recent dreary weather (although Extremadura received much needed rainfall).\r\n\r\nPerhaps not the best-suited FL scope the FSQ106 and KAF8300 ccd combination has captured some fine detail in the centre of the nebula.  For me, the nebula is visually  remniscent of the symbol for the Eye of Horus, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus :-).\r\n\r\nI have uploaded a more ubiquitous HST version plus also for an interesting contrast the CFHT pallete with its rather rich and striking cerise colouring.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson\r\n\r\nMany thanks for looking & CS to all!",
