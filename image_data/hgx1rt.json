    "description": "Mars at dawn on Wed 6 May 2020 AEST.\r\n\r\nVery steady seeing on the fog free morning allowed me to record this view of the Elysium hemisphere.  The volcanic peak appears pinkish and cloud free at the northernmost edge of the planet with Sinus Gomer albedo pencil roughly pointing in its direction.  Mare Cimmerium is on the CM and there's reasonable detail visible in the areas immediately to the north of SPC (Electris, Eridania and Ausonia).  The ice cap also shows some structure (possible clouds?) and is spectacularly bright compared to other areas of the planet.\r\n\r\nApproximately 30,000 frames acquired between 6:10 and 6:34 am Canberra time.",
