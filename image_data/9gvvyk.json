    "description": "Another deep sky object which I like very much. This image of the famous Stephan's Quintet consists of 1004 unguided exposures 180 seconds each. The data has been gathered in July, August and September of this year.\r\n\r\nThe extended halo around the group of galaxies is barely visible. It turned out that 50 hours were not enough to beat the light pollution. :)\r\n\r\nAs always the image acquisition has been fully automated by Voyager, which worked flawlessly from dusk till down during many nights.\r\n\r\nSDSS image of <a href=\"http://aladin.unistra.fr/AladinLite/?target=22%2036%201.809%2B33%2057%2046.43&fov=0.24&survey=P%2FSDSS9%2Fcolor\">Stephan's Quintet</a>\r\n\r\nThanks for looking,\r\nVitali\r\n\r\n<b>31 December 2020</b>:\r\nThere is a faint stars trail on the left from NGC7320. It is thought that it has been caused by a collision with NGC7320c (PGC 69279): \"<a href=\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2002/42/aa2731.pdf\">... the group has been visited twice by NGC 7320c. The first collision created the very faint tidal arm east of the interloper NGC 7320</a>\"",
