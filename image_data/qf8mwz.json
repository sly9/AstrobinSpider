    "description": "Taken over several nights:  May 5, 10, 12 and 31; June 1, 7-9 and 19.\r\n\r\nThe Bubble Nebula is 7 light years across and is about 7100 light years from Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia. The star forming this nebula is 45 times more massive than our sun. Gas on the star gets so hot it escapes into space as a “stellar wind” moving at over 4 million miles per hour. This outflow sweeps up the cold, interstellar gas in front of it forming the nebula’s shell. As the surface of the shell expands, it slams into dense regions of cold gas on one side of the bubble creating the shell’s asymmetry. This asymmetry makes the star appear off-center from the bubble with its location at the 2 o’clock position in the image above.\r\n\r\nCredit:   Hubblesite.org",
