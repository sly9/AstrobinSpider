    "description": "Even this is a fantastic irregular galaxy, you can't find a lot of pics of this one. I decided to give it a try and was astonished how bright it is. I didn't expect that brightness and was wondering how Charles Messier could oversee it. Because of a lot of activity there, H alpha subs are mandatory of course. They form a very nicely contrast to the bluish young star regions. Hope you like it.\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
