    "description": "This image shows M61 with the supernova 2020jfo. the SN was discovered on 5/6/2020 and may be near peak magnitude near the time the photo was taken. It is the first supernova I have ever imaged. M61 is a spiral galaxy in the Virgo cluster. I lies about 52 million light years away, appears abut 6.5 x 5.9 arcminutes in size, and is a starburst galaxy with a high rate of star formation. With only three hours of exposure and using an one shot color camera, only hints of the star forming regions are seen in this image. \r\nHope you enjoy the image, which is still a work in progress.",
