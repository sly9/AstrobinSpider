    "description": "I shot the Skull Nebula with the 1m RC from Chilescope during these rainy November days. It is located in Cetus, around 2100 ly from us. The central star is a white dwarf Hip 3678, however there is clearly a binary in the center (not only an optical one I suppose). I found that the nebula contains much fluorine, 250 more than usual. With interesting dental implications for future explorations.\r\n\r\nR 8x600s\r\nG 8x600s\r\nB 8x600s",
