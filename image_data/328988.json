    "description": "This elusive supernova remnant in Taurus is dominated by sharply focused filaments, which lead to its somewhat disparaging common name Spaghetti Nebula. In the ancient times of chemical film  photography it was regarded as an extremely difficult object, and it was a big achievement if someone could come up with a photo of some impression. That time only the brighter filaments were in reach of amateur photographers, and hence the name originated. Nowadays we can scratch bit more effective on the sky, and more photons get recorded by our sensors. So there is also weak nebulositiy in between visible. Still, an extravagant object of delicate celestial beauty.\r\n\r\nThis is a LRGBHaOIII with Astrel8300 standalone CCD attached to Sigma 180mm Macro. AZ-EQ6 guided and dithered ba Lacerta MGEN.",
