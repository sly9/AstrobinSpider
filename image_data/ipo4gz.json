    "description": "Not frequently imaged, NGC 5850 is a barred spiral galaxy in Virgo estimated to be approximately 90 million light years from Earth. It is thought to have been disrupted by what is described as a high speed encounter with  NGC 5846 the large Elliptical Galaxy on the right of the frame. \n\nImaged in LRGB on our CDK 1000 and RiDK 700 at El Sauce, Obstech, Chile.\nThe image portion containing NGC 5846 is from the RiDK 700 as this galaxy is partially outside the FOV of the CDK 1000.\n\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\nSystem Control: Voyager by Leo Orazi\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/masterdarksastro",
