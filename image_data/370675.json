    "description": "I have attempted the Iris a few times with only one 'success' when I collaborated on a widefield image with Paddy Gilliland some years ago.  The other attempts from home have failed as I have never been able to gather sufficient subs.  So I am really pleased to present an image with which I am satisfied.  I particularly like the delicate internal structures and blushing pinkish hues.\r\n\r\nOnce again the capture was shared between the two FSQ106 rigs at e-Eye, with Luminance on one, RGB on the other.\r\n\r\nFrom APOD: \"These cosmic clouds have blossomed 1,300 light-years away, in the fertile starfields of the constellation Cepheus. Called the Iris Nebula, NGC 7023 is not the only nebula to evoke the imagery of flowers, though. Still, this deep telescopic image shows off the Iris Nebula's range of colors and symmetries, embedded in surrounding fields of interstellar dust. Within the Iris itself, dusty nebular material surrounds a hot, young star. The dominant color of the brighter reflection nebula is blue, characteristic of dust grains reflecting starlight. Central filaments of the reflection nebula glow with a faint reddish photoluminesence as some dust grains effectively convert the star's invisible ultraviolet radiation to visible red light. Infrared observations indicate that this nebula contains complex carbon molecules known as PAHs. The pretty blue petals of the Iris Nebula span about six light-years. The colorful field-of-view stretches almost five Full Moons across the sky. \"\r\n\r\nData Acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne.\r\nImage processing: Barry Wilson",
