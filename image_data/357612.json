    "description": "Finally some first color data ;) Couldn't resist to wait and decided to put this one up already. I am really impressed by seeing stars so far away, NGC 206 is a stunning sight and to get so close is a real pleasure.\r\n\r\nDidn't want to bother you guys with another teaser so I worked out two interesting features of this panel: Cepheid Var 1 (here is an interesting link about it: <a href=\"https://futurism.com/hubble-variable-1-the-star-that-changed-the-universe/\" target=\"_blank\">Hubble Variable 1: The Star That Changed the Universe</a>) and NGC 206, one of the brightest and largest star clouds in our local group (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_206\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>)\r\n\r\nStill missing Ha for all panels and Blue for Panel 2/3/4 so this will be the last one before I can hopefully finish this project  ;)",
