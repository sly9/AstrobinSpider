    "description": "I first attempted this galaxy cluster 2 years ago when still dialing in the 24\"...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/362307/\">1st attempt in 2018</a>\r\n\r\n... so I thought I'd try again with things starting to settle down.\r\n\r\nSkies were very dark (21.5 SQM) and steady (under 2\" FWHM), so color capture was much better than in 2018.\r\n\r\n2x drizzle was used to help extract detail in the very smallest galaxies.\r\n\r\n\"The Hercules Cluster (Abell 2151) is a cluster of about 200 galaxies some 500 million light-years distant in the constellation Hercules. It is rich in spiral galaxies and shows many interacting galaxies. The cluster is part of the larger Hercules Supercluster, which is itself part of the much larger Great Wall super-structure.\"",
