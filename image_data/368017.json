    "description": "NGC 6188 is a star-forming emission nebula approximately 4,000 light years from Earth, and can be seen in the constellation Ara.  A somewhat popular nickname for NGC6188 is the ‘Fighting Dragons’ nebula because of its distinctive appearance.  \r\n\r\nAlso within the field of view is the open cluster NGC 6193 (top, just left of centre), a source of illumination for NGC 6188.  Ultraviolet radiation from the giant stars within NGC 6193 is eroding the edge of its parent molecular cloud and may sustaining star formation in the surrounding region. \r\n\r\nThis image was processed in PixInsight using the Hubble Space Telescope palette (Red = SII, Green = Ha, Blue = OIII). The final image was only slightly cropped, then re-sampled by 120% for aesthetic reasons.",
