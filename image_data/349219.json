    "description": "NGC 1269 / NGC1291\r\n\r\nI started this project in October 2016 when at the time I haven't had enough data to obtain detailed image of this unusual barred ring Galaxy. (See original post https://astrob.in/270624/F/ )\r\n\r\nI waited eagerly to October 2017 for the opportunity to capture more frames and I'm pretty happy with what I've achieved here; much more details in the rings core as well as more color.",
