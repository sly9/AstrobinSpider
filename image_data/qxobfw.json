    "description": "The Helix Nebula - NGC7293\r\n\r\nThe Helix Nebula (also known as NGC 7293 or Caldwell 63) is a planetary nebula located in the constellation Aquarius. Discovered by Karl Ludwig Harding, probably before 1824, this object is one of the closest to the Earth of all the bright planetary nebulae. It is similar in appearance to the Cat's Eye Nebula and the Ring Nebula, whose size, age, and physical characteristics are similar to the Dumbbell Nebula, varying only in its relative proximity and the appearance from the equatorial viewing angle. The Helix Nebula has sometimes been referred to as the \"Eye of God\" in pop culture, as well as the \"Eye of Sauron\".\r\n\r\nThis is a re-edit of one of my favorite targets in the night sky. @gregturgeon_astro was kind enough to share his 11hr HA & OIII data set.
