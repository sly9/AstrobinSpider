    "description": "(Almost) Starless rendition of Andromeda Galaxy (2-panel mosaic). Hery hard to get rid of stars and to generate perfectly smooth bachground, so had to put a lot of work there.\r\n\r\nTried to preserve all HII regions in the image. Interestingly, you can see that some of them located in extreme outskirts, where almost no starglow can be seen in this image.",
