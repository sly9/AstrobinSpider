    "description": "Testing my edge 11 under beautiful dark sky in Hilders Rh√∂n. The Aeria is a national starpark with superb conditions in the middle of germany. My luck is having a friend living there, whom I visited over 3 days with my scope for astroimaging.  Hans was very interested in what I am doing and was with me all the time discussing astrofotography. Hope you like our version of Arp 269...\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
