    "description": "Finally completed my M33 project. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I could not collect the H-alpha because of bad weather but will save that for next year.\r\n\r\nProcessing this image was not easy with 1587 frames and 47 hours of exposure. Had to find new ways to make that possible, it succeeded nonetheless.\r\nI will probably update this image soon depending on what I see.\r\n\r\nNo flats, no darks, no calibration frames at all. I will make a version with calibrated frames also to see what the difference is... As of now I see no reason at all to use calibration frames with my setup but I could be very wrong :P\r\nOf course, I use very heavy dithering all the time.\r\n\r\nNow I have to think about if collecting so many data is worth it, or better stick with some less data so I can image more objects.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it :-)",
