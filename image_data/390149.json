    "description": "Devils Orchard is one of several points of interest areas at Craters.   It offers a wide-scape of angled trees and formations which gives it it's namesake.  Area offers a stunning view of the desolate landscape .  Took this image with only a tripod, camera and 16mm wide angle lens in increments of 20 seconds.  Used seven horizontal panels.  (Should have done at least 9 vertical panels but this was just the start of learning mosaics)  Anyway, came out better than expected. ISO 1600 at f/2",
