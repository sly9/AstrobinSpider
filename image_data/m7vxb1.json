    "description": "Then the season is definitely over from Norway. This will be the last from me, before those dark evenings return. It was not perfect conditions this time. The moon was troublesome, and the night darkness short. But was still happy with the result. I had some old OIII files from Nikon added, so can look at some stars that are not quite good, FOW was not quite the same.\r\n\r\nI have used starspikes pro carefully on some stars just to get a little nicer effect.\r\n\r\nOla",
