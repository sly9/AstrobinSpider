    "description": "47 Tucanae (also known as 47 Tuc or NGC 104) is the second brightest globular cluster in the sky - second only the massive Omega Centauri cluster.  It is one of the few globular clusters (along with Omega Centauri) visible to the naked eye.  47 Tuc spans about 120 light years and is approximately 13,000 light years light years from Earth.  It can be seen in the constellation of Tucana. \r\n\r\nThe picture was formed by combing individual images taken with three different filters that allow imaging of Red, Green and Blue broadband colours.  \r\n\r\nThe image was fully processed in PixInsight.  The finalized picture was only slightly cropped and re-sampled by 120% for aesthetic reasons.",
