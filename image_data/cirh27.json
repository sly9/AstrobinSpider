    "description": "I started with the 8\" newton last year and then forgot about it. Two weeks ago, while I was waiting for the rise of Jupiter, I had to kill 3 hours on the Sofienalpe, which is only Bortle 7. So I made Ha with the 8\" on M106. Last night I finished it with 7.5 hours on the 5\" dual setup. This is the first time I combined the 5\" and 8\" newton and it worked very well.ðŸ˜ƒ",
