    "description": "this is just a small part of the huge Chamaeleon I molecular cloud, at 480 lightyears one of the nearest star fabrics. On top of the red cone dubbed GN11.07.3 lies Cha IRN, a young T Tauri variable, the blueish reflection nebulas name is Cederblad 111 and the ivory reflection nebula to the right is Cederblad 110. The dark cloud resembling a dogs head was given the number 5849 in Dobashis catalogue of dark clouds from 2011. An there is a small complex of Herbig-Haro objects right below the image center called HH49 and HH50. None of these appear in any atlas or desktop planetarium, not in CdC nor SkySafari, its merely a blank spot in the sky. However, if you happen to photograph something you do not know, you always can platesolve it and try to ask Aladin :-)\r\nhttps://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinLite/\r\n\r\nPhotographed with 8\"f4 Newtonian and ASI1600MMP, Optolong 31mm filters LRGB at Rooisand farm in Namibia - www.deepskysafaris.com",
