    "description": "This galaxy had some fairly strong Ha details at the core. I combined a light pollution filter with Ha data for the luminance layer.\r\n\r\nOn a personal note, every time it rains I get alligators in my pond. When I shine the light across the pond at night, their eyes glow orange. So, I turned the very center orange. I hope this is not too offensive.",
