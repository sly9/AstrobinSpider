    "description": "Main focus was to retain and recover as much colour as possible. the problem is,  stars are very often blown out in M13 and end up in uniform colour.\nAnd certainly this was the case with first test processing. \nAfter a series of different minimal and careful type of stretching colour started to show up and this final results were achieved. \nThere was much room for more enhancement and sharpening but on the cost of the image natural properties. \nThis way is calm and yet informative.",
