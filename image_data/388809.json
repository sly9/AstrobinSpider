    "description": "This is certainly a tough object because of the large diameter and how faint it is.  I tried it once before using a 135mm lens.  This time I used an AT80EDT refractor plus a Riccardi .75x reducer/flattener.  The NB binned 2x2 6 panel mosaic data was acquired with an Atik 460ex and 2 panel RGB with an ASI071.  Ha 190x300s, OIII  120x300s, RGB 44x150s.   OIII needed more data but I ran out of clear nights and patience.  This resulted in a fairly noisy background, unfortunately.  The image is a blend of 65% Ha, 20% OIII, and 15% RGB.",
