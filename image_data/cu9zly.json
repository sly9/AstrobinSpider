    "description": "Cassiopeia was queen of Aethiopia. She was arrogant and vain, which brought the wrath of Poseidon, ruling god of the sea. He flooded the kingdom of Aethiopia, and to punish Cassiopeia, Poseidon banished her in the heavens chained to a throne. It would seem, however, that Poseidon chose to surround the queen with jewels because the constellation of Cassiopeia is filled with beautiful, glowing nebulae. There is the Bubble Nebula (Sh2-162), just beneath it the open cluster, M52, and above it, NGC 7538, a bright emission and reflection nebula. On the right side are the familiar Lobster Claw (Sh-157), and above it a non-symmetrical open cluster, NGC 7510.\r\n\r\nThe is an SHO rendition using the traditional Hubble Palette. To improve the structural detail, a luminance mask was used comprised of Ha sub lights with HFR of 2.4 or less.",
