    "description": "CG4 is a Cometary Globule in a state of rupture. It is often called God's Hand although it more resembles a tube worm. It is located in the constellation of Puppis, about 1,300 light-years away. Its head is some 1.5 light-years in diameter, and its tail is about 8 light-years long. The dusty cloud contains enough material to make several medium sized stars.\nImaged in LRGB and H Alpha on our RiDK 400 at El Sauce, Obstech, Chile\nImaged Processing: Mike Selby\nSystem Control Software: Voyager by Leo Orazi\nRiDK 400 Team: Mike Selby, Leo Orazi, John Kasianowicz, Rick Stevenson, Josh Balsam and Scott Johnson\nhttps://www.facebook.com/masterdarksastro",
