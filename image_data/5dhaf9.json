    "description": "This is my first process of a complete data set that I've processed from my remote site at Deep Sky West-Chile.  There was 21.2 hours of subs, so needless to say, it took me 2 days to process it all.  This, of course, is the Great Carina Nebula (NGC 3372) which is about 300 light-years across......I'm estimating that the field of view of this image is around 50-75 light-years.  This nebula, like the Orion Nebula is visible to the naked eye but it's 7,500 light-years from Earth, which is 5 times further than the Orion Nebula.   It's one of the Milky Way's most prolific star forming regions.  Objects included in this image are, of course, the variable Eta Carinae, Trumpler 14, and the Keyhole Nebula, just to mention a few.\r\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\r\nTom",
