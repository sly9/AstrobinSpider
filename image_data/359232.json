    "description": "Certainly my best photo of Mars this year, many details easily visible both at the wavelength of visible and in the infrared.\r\nVallis Marineris stands out in the center of the photo as well as several other regions around him, but what caught my attention was the presence of Olympus Mons at 10am as well as the 3 volcanoes of Tharsis a little more towards the center, they can be seen easily as terrain elevations and not simple blemishes.",
