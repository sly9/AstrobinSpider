    "description": "Iris Nebula is dramatic reflection nebula in the constellation Cepheus.\r\nWith plenty of dark interstellar dust is illuminated by a central hot star named SAO 19158 which is 10 times the mass of our sun. \r\n\r\nIt lies 1,300 light-years away and is six light-years across.\r\n\r\nIt was integrated only 15 hours, 50% best frames of the total valid frames taken between May and June of 2019.\r\n\r\nPD: I am glad to check my improvements when I compare to <a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/263914\"> this other capture</a> from three years ago. :D",
