    "description": "An animation of 8 solar frames captured over 2h22m on 18-MAR-2019.   There was a nice filament next to an active spot/flare.   In this sequence you can see the brightening of the flare, though I'm not sure I caught the peak of it.  \r\n\r\nSeeing was variable and so was the frame quality.  I did my the best to smooth that out.",
