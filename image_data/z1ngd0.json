    "description": "* Image acquisition by: The Liverpool Telescope.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* Distance: 22 Mly.\r\n\r\nNGC 6946 is an spiral galaxy about 22 million light-years away, in the constellations of Cepheus and Cygnus. NGC 6946 is highly obscured by interstellar matter of the Milky Way galaxy, as it is quite close to the galactic plane. The true diameter of the galaxy is approximately 40,000 light-years or just about one-third of the Milky Way's size.\r\n\r\nDue to the prodigious star formation it has been classified as a starburst galaxy.\r\n\r\nOver the past century, ten supernovae have been discovered along the active spiral arms of this galaxy.",
