    "description": "Jones-Emberson 1, also known as the Headphone Nebula, is a 14th magnitude planetary nebula in the constellation Lynx at a distance of 1600 light years. It is a larger planetary with low surface brightness.\r\n\r\nMy very first planetary nebula! I mainly discounted this type of DSO in the past because of their small size. I thought maybe I could collect enough data to keep noise down to an acceptable level and drizzle the data and crop to get in a little closer. This is the approach I took, however, It was harder than I thought to bring out the detail in the PN and keep the noise to an acceptable level, but overall I am thrilled with the result.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\nCS\r\nDan.",
