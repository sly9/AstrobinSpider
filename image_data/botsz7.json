    "description": "We are always looking at ways to extract more details from our images without creating more noise or artifacts. This animation shows the effects of using two of Topaz's AI applications, Sharpen AI and Gigapixel AI on an image that I had already completed the initial processing.\r\n\r\nBe sure to click on the image to see the larger rendition and get the full effect of the additional detail.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly food for thought.\r\n\r\nBTW, I have gotten nothing free from Topaz.",
