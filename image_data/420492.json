    "description": "The Western Veil.  \r\nThis was taken at the table Mountain Star party.   I lost about a third of my frames because of guiding issues.  I think mostly backlash issues with my AVX.  When scope is pointed almost straight up is when the guiding is the worst. Trying some creative balancing and weighting to minimize oscillations. Mixed results at best.  But I did get enough good frames to make a decent picture.",
