    "description": "PK164 (or Jones-Emberson 1) is a relatively large but faint planetary nebula in the constellation Lynx. The central mag 16.8 white-dwarf parent star is visible at the center of the nebula. This took a large number of exposures in Ha and OIII,  the latter being particularly faint. I did collect some RGB data to support integration of RGB stars at some later stage. \r\n\r\nI could have done with more data as the nebula is a little noisy but as I've already spent nearly 3 months elapsed time collecting this data (due to consistently poor weather) I think I will move on to the next target!",
