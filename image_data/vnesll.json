    "description": "The Pleiades Star Cluster (M45) also known as the Seven Sisters, is one of the closest star clusters to earth, between 434 and 446 light years away.  The brightest stars can be seen with your naked eye, even through light pollution, but not the nebulosity around them.  They are relatively young stars (less than 100 million years old) and therefore give off a blueish light because they burn at a higher temperature than older cooler orange or red stars.  As the stars move through space, they happen to be passing through some dust clouds and their blue light illuminates them nicely.\r\n\r\nThis was imaged with my Pentax K1 DSLR camera on my telescope, going back to how I did things 2 years ago when I first got my telescope.  I don't have light pollution filters for this camera so I drove up to a remote dark area to sit out and capture these for the night.\r\n\r\n114 individual 2 minute exposures, iso1600 (f7 telescope) stacked and processed in pixinsight.  \r\nScope - Stellarvue SVA130t (910mm focal length)\r\nMount - Ioptron CEM60\r\nCamera - Pentax K1 mark ii DSLR\r\nno moon night, Bortle 4 darkness scale location",
