    "description": "This is the center Ha/SII \"land bridge\" in the Soul Nebula (IC 1848). It's tucked between two \"ponds\" of OIII emission and has a lot of interesting structures.\r\n\r\nBased on feedback I tend to over-do the noise reduction. This is my attempt at toning it back for a sharper more natural image. I'm pretty happy with how it ended up and will have to do the same in the future.",
