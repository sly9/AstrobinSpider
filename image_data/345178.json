    "description": "This is NGC 1999 from DSW RCOS data taken in November through December 2017 in Orion.  It is located 1,500ly distant.  It is a bright reflection nebula due to V380 Orionis, a variable star.  The dark triangular region in the middle is particularly dark nebula in the middle of the otherwise bright nebula.  Interestingly, it has been determined that this is actually a particularly empty space as opposed to a particularly dense dusty region.\r\n\r\nThe image is composed of LRGB.  This was an interesting choice on the part of DSW as opposed to NB imaging.  As a result, my color calibration turned out to be largely a deep bloody red color with some bits of blue above the brightest core region of the nebula.  I did use PhotometricColorCalibration in PI, so the coloring is supposedly based on scientific-based calibration.  The stars are quite saturated and only show some measure of coloring in their halos.  Should I attempt to process this again I will make more effort on dimming the stars so that they are not so dominant in the image.  Still I am impressed by the level of detail that came out of the nebula.  I applied HDRMT in order to bring out more of the brightest region surrounding the dark region.",
