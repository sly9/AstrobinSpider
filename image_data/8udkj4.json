    "description": "I have had a chance to collect more datas about this field since the 2012 in which I toke the first field using a prototipe of the Officina Stellare Veloce RH200. I've used other optics and CCDs to acquire photons of the area. Mainly I've imaged a very similar field using my Takahashi Epsilon 210 with a FLI 11k sensor, then I've also used images at crescent resolutions with the same scope coupled to a QSI 683 and also an OS Pro RC 360 with a FLI back illuminated sensor (most of datas are in the \"Viking's boat area\"). Recently my good firend Maurizio Mollica gave me even more integration of the iris made with an RC 8\" with a Sbig ST 8300 sensor. I've used as a \"base\" image, the one I've toke in Austria in 2012 under very good sky, the same that I've already published here in the past. I've completely re-made the editing of that datas and then I've included the newer ones. The result is an image that includes about 30+ hours of exposures.\r\n\r\nHere it is the IRIS Nebula, a flower in the dust.\r\n\r\nThanks everybody.",
