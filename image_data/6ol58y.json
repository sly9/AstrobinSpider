    "description": "I was able to capture this galaxy again after one year with C14 Edge HD. I do believe it is an improved version from an year ago.  Also in the video link (I put that link along with the picture), I posted a complete review of Celestron 14 Edge HD with CGX-L mount.  If you are interested check it out!!",
