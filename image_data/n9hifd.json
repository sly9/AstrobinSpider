    "description": "A rarely photographed emission near the famous Heart Nebula.  It appears in widefield images of the region, but to the best of my knowledge has never been isolated.  I do not know if it has a name or designation.  It resembles a planarian (flatworm) to me.  This crop of my Heart Nebula image reveals that a section of sky typically portrayed as dark and featureless (except for our swimming little friend) is actually filled with faint structure.",
