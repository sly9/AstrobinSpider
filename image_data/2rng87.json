    "description": "Cat's Eye Nebula or NGC 6543 with his beautiful halo was the most challenging target so far for me. Was captured along 5 short nights, only 2 hours every clear night, some during the full moon, and on top of things with new equipment. Up to now, it's very promising but still, I will add more data. Even that is rather close to us is very small and has a huge light difference from the core to the outer hallo but the hallo came ok at 300 sec and the core at 30 sec. Will see how will progress while adding more data. Any constructive criticism is more than welcomed.",
