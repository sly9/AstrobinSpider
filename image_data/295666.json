    "description": " This is a small and  fairly bright PN in cygnus.  This has good signal both in Ha and OIII with stronger OIII shell over Ha giving a \"fetus\" looking image . \r\n\r\nThis was shot at native FL of 2800mm and ASI1600 giving a iamge scale of 0.28 arcsec/px. The gain was set to unity .  This was shot with almost full moon but the seeing was good giving pretty crisp data.",
