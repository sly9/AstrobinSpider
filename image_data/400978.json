    "description": "These galaxies never get more than 37 deg above the horizon from my northern location, and are as low as 25 deg when I start imaging them. That puts these near the southerly edge of what I can image, due to both physical obstructions (trees, my ROR south wall) as well as atmospheric haze and turbulence. But I had a few good days over the winter and was able to capture 14 hours worth of subs. I discarded a couple of hours worth during processing due to poor stars.",
