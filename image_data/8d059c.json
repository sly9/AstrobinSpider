    "description": "M106 in Canes Venatici is about 22-25 Mly away, with a known supermassive black hole at its heart.  A kinda sorta <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.2830.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">recent paper published in 2010</a> found 16 satellite galaxy candidates of M106:  Eight of these galaxies are found to be dwarf galaxies that are much smaller and fainter than the remaining galaxies and four of these galaxies are new findings.  From my FOV, the larger ones of these include NGC 4248, NGC 4220, and NGC 4218.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nCS, Ara",
