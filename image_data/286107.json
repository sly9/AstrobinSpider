    "description": "NGC 1788 is also known as the Fox Face Nebula (have a close look and you will see why.). The nebula itself is the lighter patch located in the top right hand quadrant of the image and is also collocated with Lynds 1616, a dark nebula. NGC 1788 is a reflection nebula which means that it does not emit its own light. The light we see results from the reflection of star light in the centre of the nebula. The brown colours in this image result from interstellar dust and together with the nebula itself sort of make up the shape of the body of a canine type of animal (at least I think that it does).",
