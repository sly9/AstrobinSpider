    "description": "NGC 772 is an unbarred spiral galaxy 130 million light years away in the constellation of Aries.  It is object 78 in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies (published in 1966).  It is surrounded by a number of satellite galaxies, the most prominent of which is NGC 770.  NGC 772's spiral arm is a result of tidal interactions.  Some of this material appears to connect to NGC 770.\r\n\r\nNGC 772 was photographed between 24 and 30 September 2019 from a remote imaging rig in Spain owned and operated by Barry Wilson and Steve Milne.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nLum: 42 x 600s\r\nRed: 30 x 300s\r\nGreen: 30 x 300s\r\nBlue: 30 x 300s\r\n\r\nA total of 14 hours 30 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nThis image has been cropped to make NGC 772 a bit more prominent in the frame.\r\n\r\nData capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
