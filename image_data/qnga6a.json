    "description": "Tarantula Nebula is an impressive cosmic object, it lies in Great Magellanic Cloud, a nearby galaxy of our local group. This nebula is very rich in hydrogen, in this image we can see many complex clouds of ionized gas. NGC 2070 is a jewel for southern astrophotographers and I'm feeling so happy with this work. It's always a challenge to get this nebula because it is high on sky in rainy season here in Brazil.\r\n\r\n**Equipment: refractor 80mm F7.5, mount SkyWatcher HEQ5, camera QHY163M and Optolong filters.\r\n\r\n**Total exposure: 6.8 hours\r\n\r\nStarNet++ was applied to remove background stars.",
