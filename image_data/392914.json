    "description": "Was blessed with exceptional conditions this morning.. acquired mountain of data covering Oval BA and the GRS, here's one of the last capture intervals with seeing at its best (19 minutes before sunrise). WinJUPOS period of 4.5 minutes covering 2400 HQ frames.\r\n\r\nFocused solely on Jupiter with a couple of high magnification daylight Moon views to wrap up the session, hope to process them soon. Started recording around 5:20 am local time but was forced to delete 26 minutes of initial AVIs to make room on my notebook.. next time will have a USB drive on standby. Luckily seeing wasn't that good at <60 degree elevation.\r\n\r\nOval BA has indeed lost its pale white appearance and is increasing saturation again. Some internal structure within the GRS and a red projection in SEB towards the north east are also on show.",
