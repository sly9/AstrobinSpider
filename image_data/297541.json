    "description": "For years I am trying to get a decent dataset on this amazing target. It is one of my favourite regions in the sky, but in Germany it is also very low and typically hangs inside the light pollution. Last weekend, I was finally able to capture some amount of time in a pretty dark region and I was able to create this image. I am still not really happy and the image shows a lot of noise, but it is a beginning. \r\nI am wondering if more than 200 frames would help at all.. Any tips are welcome!\r\n\r\nWork on my data! Here is the link to my original stacked FIT file! http://www.astrobin.com/rawdata/publicdatapools/93/",
