    "description": "Here we have The Leo 1 Dwarf Galaxy, UGC5470.  \r\n\r\nI was inspired to try making this one by the wonderful image recently published by Marc Verhoeven (https://www.astrobin.com/gvztm2/?nc=user).   I am an admirer of his fine work.\r\n\r\nThe primary reason for doing this was I considered it sort of a challenge to myself to see if I actually could do it.  In the end, I think I did succeed but I have no illusions about the quality of the image.\r\n\r\nUGC5470, an unusual galaxy is classified as a Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy and is thought to be the the furthest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.  It lies approximately 820,000 to 900,000 light years distant.  It was first imaged in 1950 by the Schmidt Camera at the Palomar Observatory.\r\n\r\nObviously, the challenge with this image is the attenuation of the powerful light from Regulus.  I was able to sort of tame that by masking it and reducing it's luminocity.  I wanted to do this to reveal more of Leo 1 but without seriously degrading or otherwise altering what is actually there.  I don't know if I have succeeded in preserving that authenticity.  But I worked on that a lot...  Additionally, I'm not too pleased with the stars in this one either.    But on the whole, I think it worthy of posting and I hope you agree!\r\n\r\nAny comments/criticism are welcome.  Clear Skies and good health.",
