    "description": "This image comprises recent Ha data from e-Eye from the TEC140/QSI690 Steve and I operate and SII, Ha and OIII data from my home observatory in Totnes acquired in 2018 using my WO 132FLT/QSI683 at 1.47\"/px, https://astrob.in/329357/D/.\r\n\r\nSteve and I have been imaging the Rosette core at 0.75\"/px early evening as the moon has been rising before switching to other targets mid-evening.  We will not be able to collect the SII and OIII this season so I processed the 28 x 1200s of Ha and re-aligned my older image to provide the 'colour' for the higher resolution Ha data: it is effectively like imaging bin 1 for the Ha and bin 2 for the SII and OIII.\r\n\r\nAfter a crop to take care of the mis-aligmnent and some additional NR due to the resampling, a few enhancements, et voila!\r\n\r\nThe 'Carnival of Animals' reference is of course the resemblance of the dark dust to a troop of fantastical animals and Saint-Saens humorous musical suite. . . which animals, well your guess is as good as mine.\r\n\r\nCS!\r\n\r\nHa data: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne.\r\nBalance of NB data: Barry Wilson",
