    "description": "This object is a beautiful dark nebula located only 600 light years away in the constellation of Aquila.  The object is the 673rd object in Lynds Catalogue of Dark Nebulae.\r\n\r\nMost dark nebula have a fairly simple structure, but not this one.   I love that this object is actually comprised of 12 or so individual arcing smaller objects seemingly placed at random.  The best way to describe it to me is that it looks like a Rorschach test.  The molecular clouds in the local Aquila rift make the background stars look reddish, except towards the top of the image where blue is reflected by several bright blue stars.\r\n\r\nWithin the dark nebula are three small but fascinating objects.  The first is Herbig-Haro object HH32 in the upper right.  HH 32 is an older HH object and the central star (AS 353A) has already blown out most of the formation dust, so that the star is clearly visible.  The shock waves from the bipolar jets are barely visible.  The second interesting object is the orange tinted nebula RNO 109 at upper center.   RNO stands for 'Red Nebulous Object', a catalog of 150 such objects published by Martin Cohen in 1980.  Dr. Cohen is a British astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley and NASA Ames Research Center. The third interesting object is GD 218 - a white dwarf.  It is the tiny bright blue dot roughly midway between the previous two objects.",
