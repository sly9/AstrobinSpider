    "description": "Here we have an attempt at M104, The Sombrero Galaxy.  \r\n\r\nThis project is the first completed with an OAG which has made an incredible difference in my guiding, particularly at longer focal lengths.  I used this with the ASI174 which allowed for a lot of potential guide stars and multi star guiding in Phd2.  The difference was amazing.\r\n\r\nI still think I can do this better but I had a lot of trouble pulling color out of this one.  I know it is not that colorful of an area but I'm not satisfied so maybe I will look at this one again in the future.\r\n\r\nM104 is another of those very iconic subjects and really bright.  Accordingly, I tried to do a HDR image for the luminance in hopes of revealing a little more detail in the disk.  I'm  thinking that some of the detail may be over processed resulting in some artifacts but I did like the hint of some depth around the edges of the galaxy.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I hope you like it and of course, comments and criticism always welcome!",
