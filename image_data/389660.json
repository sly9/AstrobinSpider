    "description": "Billion and Billions\r\n\r\nGalaxies are everywhere, in fact there are so many galaxies that it would take 300 million years to count them one by one everyday, Yes, there simply is no limit to the size of the Universe. Despite all this we as humans cannot comprehend these majestic structures in space, this Galaxy has pushed my telescope to its limits even more. Positioned in the constellation Antilla rising above our heads it lies 40 million light years from us. Each light year is appx 10 Trillion kilometers, yet despite the vast incomprehensible distance, light in its true glory takes 40 million years to get here. This galaxy is running thru space at turbulent speeds. It would surpass our galaxy in size and star population.",
