    "description": "Hi everybody! Long time has passed since my last photo... Anyway, this is an image of the dark nebula B150 that I took during 3 days in a not so bad sky during a star party last year.\r\nStill noisy since it lacks integration time... I was hungry about taking pictures as always when You haven't done it for a long time so I shut these images spanned in 3 days in the middle of other shots at other subjects... In the end I've got about 3 hours of luminance and about 1 hour for each channel of RGB using my old Tak Epsilon 210 at f3... This is the result (for now, since I'm planning to add more integration time...).\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by.",
