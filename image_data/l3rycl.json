    "description": "First light with my ASI2600MM Pro. 120 minutes Ha and 70 minutes OIII. Bottom center is out of focus, was worse with OIII than Ha. I shot some lum of a different target that did not show this problem before going to the veil. I rotated the camera to frame the veil so I need to check the rotator and adjust.\r\n\r\nNot a lot of time, as I said it was just trying out a new camera. Looks promising!\r\n\r\nAlso my first mono/narrowband attempt.",
