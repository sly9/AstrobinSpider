    "description": "I was surprised to see the signal levels in the three channels - very strong HA and SII, and very little OIII. Straight forward SOH or SHO combinations lead to very fancy psychedelic colours. In the end  I settled for SII as red, a blend of SII and OIII as green, and OII as blue which created a RGB image that I combined with HA as luminance. \r\n\r\nMy TS APO with 520 mm and the ASI 1600 do not give the optimal field here - a  smaller focal length (or a larger chip) would have allowed to include more of the diffuse features below the jelly fish.",
