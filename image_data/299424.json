    "description": "Here is my version of a starless M16 using Josh Smiths tone mapping technique.\r\n\r\nMost the work apart from initial preprocessing was completed in Photoshop as I felt it was easier to cleanly remove the stars and deal with artifacts.\r\n\r\nI will add some RGB Stars once I get some clear skies. (RGB Star version http://www.astrobin.com/299651/?nc=user)\r\n\r\nAs always C&C are greatly appreciated. Cheers",
