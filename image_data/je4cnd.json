    "description": "Gary Imm posted an image of NGC5371 from 15 February on Astrobin, and Gotthard Stuhm commented that he had captured a supernova. I imaged the same galaxy and a few more on 13 March without knowing that there was a supernova there, so when I now had another look at the image, it is still there but a bit more dim than in Gary's image taken a month earlier. So here is a crop of my image with the supernova pointed out. My original post of the galaxy is here:\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/4rscsy/B/\r\n\r\nGary Imms' image is here:\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/qe5s3j/",
