    "description": "Today I sat down for a whole day working with my M42 data because I knew I was doing something wrong. This time i created the cleanest Ha, Oiii and Sii frames I could , tweaking all the parameters in Pix for hours looking for the best outcome at every step, and this time around it actually made a difference.\r\n\r\nFollowing Ignacio Bobillo's advice I combined Ha+Sii (Red), Oiii + Sii (Green) and Oiii (Blue), which gave a much more natural looking palette than SHO. I used Ha as Lum too.\r\n\r\nClear skies everyone!",
