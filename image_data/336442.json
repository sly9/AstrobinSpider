    "description": "LBN 406:\r\nLBN 406 is a very faint Molecular Cloud in the constellation Draco. This molecular cloud on Lynds scale of scale of 1 to 6, is classified as very dim and bairly visible at 1. There are a lot of interesting faint nebula whisps and a number of small galaxies. This area is often called The Laughing Skull Nebula it is on the right and upside down. The jaw is toward the top a little hard to visualize. Also at the upper right is a small galaxy, UGC 10548, that looks like a little planet Saturn.\r\n\r\nThis is an RGB image (22) Red, (22)Green, (23) Blue. and is cropped to center the nebula better.\r\nSeeing was OK but Sky Quality was good at 21.95 average over the three nights of integration.",
