    "description": "This patch of sky in the constellation of Auriga is home to a cluster of young stars and the remainder of the cloud of gas and dust from which they were hatched. The cluster, consisting of the band of stars lower-left center, is referred to as NGC 1893. The ultraviolet light produced by these stars powers the nebula. Atoms of hydrogen and other elements in the nebula are emitting their own light after being excited by this starlight, a sort of cosmic black-light effect. The nebula itself is known as IC 410, and is home to a pair of intriguing structures popularly known as the \"tadpoles.\" These tadpoles, which consist of denser, cooler gas and dust, are approximately 10 light-years long and potentially sites of ongoing star formations.  The tails are formed by the winds and radiation of the cluster’s stars, the tadpoles are pointing their tails outwards, away from the nebula’s central regions. \r\n\r\n149 x 600\" Ha\r\n92 x 600\" OIII\r\n88 x 600\" SII",
