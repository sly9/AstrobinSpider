    "description": "Here my try on the Jones Emberson 1 headphones ðŸ˜Š. Again, another try to get as many 10 minute exposures together, which was in this case not as bad since it is a pure HOO image, so just 2 channels. And ... I can image this nebula all through the night (Cindy, I hear you ... ðŸ˜Š), no trees in the way, so just letting it run overnight is nice, also knowing that the weather will hold up with 0% chance of rain. The dates of the data captured reflect the last night of multiple ones per channel.\r\nI always liked this PN, with its nice blue originator star in the middle. This almost wraps up my excursion with the achromat (one more to go), gave me a lot of pleasure and nice results.\r\nInfo: Constellation: Lynx; Mag: 14; Distance: 1600 LJs; 16.8-mag central star is a very blue white dwarf.",
