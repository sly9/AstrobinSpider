    "description": "SH2-132 also called The Lion Nebula\" due to its shape is a faint nebula in Cepheus. It is an extremely low surface gloss emission mist on the boundaries of the constellations of Cepheus and Lacerta. As a member of the Cep OB1 association in the Perseus arm of our galaxy, its distance is around 10,000 light-years. The Wolf-Rayet star in the object is responsible for the ionizing of radiant hydrogen and oxygen gas clouds.\r\nSource: http://bzpc.hu/introduction/\r\n\r\n Unfortunately I cut a small part of its tail when I framed :(\r\nI used a ratio of 1:2:2 for Ha/O3/S2 data acquisition\r\nData are back from 2018 under bortle 8",
