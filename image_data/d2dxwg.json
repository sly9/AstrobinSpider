    "description": "Mare Crisium was cut in two by the terminator.  It was a nice sight.  I marked the Promontorium Olivium and Promontorium Lavinium were John Joseph O'Neill (1889-1953) thought to have seen a natural or constructed bridge, hence called the Bridge of O'Neill.  There was and is of course no bridge but the subtle play of light and shadow.",
