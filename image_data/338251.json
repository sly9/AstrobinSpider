    "description": "This image was assembled and processed by me by downloading the publicly available original calibrated data from the MAST archive - https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/carina/\r\n\r\nEmbedded within the Trumpler 14 open cluster in the Carina Nebula are Herbig-Haro 901 [foreground] and 902.  Herbig-Haro objects are believed to be newly born stars which eject narrow jets of partially ionized gas. The shockwaves from the gas then interacts with the interstellar medium which surrounds the star. The stars responsible for the jets of HH 901 and 902 are buried in the gas and dust pillars imaged here. However, the shockwave wavefronts are clearly seen.\r\n\r\nHerbig-Haro objects have prominent emission lines in hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen which makes them easy to visualize when photographed through narrowband filters.\r\n\r\nCamera: Wide Field Camera 3\r\nFilters Used: 673n - S II; 657n - H-alpha + N II; and 502n - O III\r\nColor Assignments: Hubble [SHO] Palette -> red - 673n, green - 657n, and blue - 502n",
