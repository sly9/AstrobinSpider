    "description": "IC 1613 (also known as Caldwell 51) is an irregular dwarf galaxy, visible in the constellation Cetus near the star 26 Ceti. It was discovered in 1906, and is approaching Earth at 234 km/s.\r\nIC 1613 is a member of the Local Group. It has played an important role in the calibration of the Cepheid variable period-luminosity relation for estimating distances. Other than the Magellanic Clouds, it is the only Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy where RR Lyrae-type variables have been observed; this factor, along with an unusually low abundance of interstellar dust both within IC 1613 and along the line of sight enable especially accurate distance estimates (2.38 ± 0.07 Mly).\r\nIn 1999 the Hubble Space Telescope found that the dominant population of this galaxy has an age of ~7 Gyr. Its evolutionary history may be similar to that of the Pegasus Dwarf Irregular Galaxy. The galaxy also contains a rich population of OB-type stars and OB associations.",
