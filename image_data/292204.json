    "description": "This picture was actually taken by my mother and a photographer friend when they were on a trip in the US. I asked and instructed them to bring me back subs of the southern milky way that shows parts which I am unable to see in Germany, so this is a special picture for me :)\r\n\r\nThe shots were taken at Tombstone Monument Ranch in southern Arizona without even a tripod. They turned out spectacularly in my opinion! It's amazing what happens when you have no light pollution.",
