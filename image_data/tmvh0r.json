    "description": "This is the first light image for this scope for me. The combination of the FSQ106 and the ASI6200 camera provides a pixel scale of 1.46\"/px and this gigantic FOV. The data was acquired over a couple of weeks from my B6 skies in Oakland, CA and I think this SHO color palette shows the immense complexity and beauty of the region. I drizzled the data 2x and worked on RGB combined files in the near 3GB size. This was painfully slow but, it offered me the deepest exploration of this region of space I can only dream of visiting. Thanks for looking. Stay healthy and CS to all.",
