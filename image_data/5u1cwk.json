    "description": "This is one of the hardest deep space objects I have ever had to process not only due to how faint it is, but also given the limited clear nights we get here in Michigan during the winter months. I was hoping to get more integration time on this, but as the milky way moves beyond the night's sky, I need to switch telescopes on my second rig for galaxy season.\r\n\r\nThis very large planetary nebula is the second closest to earth and is very faint. SH2-216 (aka GN 04.41.3, Simeis 288, Marsalkova 44, LBN 742, YM 22, GN 04.41.3), in Perseus, is the largest known PN; one of the closest (425 light years) and one of the oldest. Its apparent diameter is reported to be 1.6° (for comparison, the Moon diameter is 0.5°).\r\n\r\nThis PN is very diffuse with a brighter east border, probably due to the interaction with the interstellar medium.",
