    "description": "The first time I saw an image of this region, I thought the colors were fake. There's Orange in there! And Yellow!\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly one of the most beautiful and most often shot wide field regions in the sky, this nebula complex is located in the constellation (big surprise here) Ophiuchus. This is a vast region of space approximately 460 light years away.\r\n\r\nThis final image is three hours of stacked 5 minute exposures at ISO 400 with a modified Canon T3i, and a Canon 200mm f/2.8 lens stopped down to f/4 with a circular aperture mask. The images were taken on a cold night at the 2017 Texas Star Party.",
