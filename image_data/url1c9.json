    "description": "Here is a comparison of the Eastern Veil Nebula using DSW Atacama Desert data, and my own data, collected in my backyard in Bortle 6.  The original is DSW and Version B is my data.  The DSW data was taken with an AP 175 at native, and my image was collected with a TOA 130 and is a 2 panel mosaic.  The stars are not RGB.  Much of the difference is no doubt a processing difference--I have learned a bit since I processed my data.  For the DSW data, I integrated the Ha and OIII stacks into a synthetic luminance and used that to make a HO-HOO image.   I inserted the RGB stars in the linear state using a gently stretched RGB image.  A very noticeable difference is the blue channel--I removed much more green from my data than I did from the DSW data.  that's purely a personal taste thing, and I am uncertain which green level .I like better--I can appreciate them both.\r\n\r\nThe DSW data consists of 11.5 hours of data, 3.75 hours of Ha and O, and about 7.75 hours of RGB.  I used the RGB data for the stars, so it was a bit of a waste.  I tried to combine the BB and NB data, but was not satisfied with the results.  My data consists only of Ha and OIII-15 30 min subs of each per panel, so 30 hours total.  A very interesting comparison.",
