    "description": "NGC 7497 is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Pegasus. Furthermore, the picture shows the large molecular cloud MBM54, which is only slightly above the galactic level. This molecular cloud is only part of a huge arc of a long coherent molecular cloud, consisting of MBM 53, 54, 55 and a cloud newly discovered  in 2003. The distance of the molecular cloud is between 500 to 850 light-years. The galaxy itself is about 60 million light-years away. In addition, many more galaxies can be seen in the image field!\r\n\r\n30x120 R\r\n30x120 G\r\n30x120 B\r\n532x120 L",
