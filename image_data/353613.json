    "description": "This object is a pair of tiny interacting spiral galaxies located  over 100 million light years away in the constellation of Bo√∂tes at a declination of +36 degrees..\r\n\r\nEach galaxy is only about one minute long in our apparent view.  NGC 5544 is the face-on galaxy which is yellowish and has distinct inner and outer disk regions, separated by an intermittent wide dust lane.  The inner region has a typical spiral structure, while the outer region looks more like a star cloud.  NGC 5545 is the bluish inclined galaxy, with a spiral structure dominated by one arm.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to discern because of the small size, but it appears that the galaxies may be interacting.  The left side of the disk of NGC 5545 appears to transition in a star stream into the inner region of NGC 5544.  However, I don't see much evidence of star formation regions initiated by the gravitational interaction, so perhaps any interaction is minimal.  \r\n\r\nThe bright object to the left of Arp 199 is galaxy PGC2081534.",
