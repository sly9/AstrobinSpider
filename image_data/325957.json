    "description": "* Image acquisition by: The Liverpool Telescope. \r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* Distance: 220 Mly.\r\n\r\nConsider this:\r\na) The arrow indicates the Quasar IXO 29 at redshift z = 0,841;\r\nb) The Universe it now about 13,7 Gyr since Big Bang;\r\nc) The age at redshift z was 6,6 Gyr (the light travel time was 7,1 Gyr).\r\nThatâ€™s incredivel, at that time, the Universe was still governed by matter (it is currently dominated by dark energy).\r\n\r\nNGC 1961 (also known as IC 2133) is a spiral galaxy in constellation Camelopardalis. It is at a distance of 200 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 1961 is more than 220,000 light years across.\r\n\r\nThe galaxy has been distorted, however no companion has been detected nor double nuclei that could show a recent merger. Its outer arms are highly irregular. Two long straight arms extent from the north side of the galaxy.\r\n\r\nNGC 1961 is the central member of the small group of nine galaxies, the NGC 1961 group.",
