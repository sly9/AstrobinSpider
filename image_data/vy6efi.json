    "description": "I love the colors and the structure of the Cygnus Loop, most especially here in Pickering's Triangle.  This object is so huge that I can't fit it in a single frame, so this is two frames in HOORGB.  Working with a mosaic from this camera was a bit of a challenge (not sure why my sky brightness was a bit funky) but I finally got to a result.\r\n\r\nThe eastern side of the veil looks like the creature from Alien to me, so I decided that the western side was pretty enough!  Hope you all agree.\r\n\r\nTim.",
