    "description": "NGC 1514 is a planetary nebula visible in Taurus constellation.\r\nIt has a diameter of 2.2' and shows a central star of magnitude 9.3 which is unusually bright for these type of objects: probably it is a binary star with a period of 10 days and the gas which constitute the nebula is expanding away from the more massive star of the pair.\r\nIn this image, between the planetary nebula and the bright yellow star on the right side, it is visible also some interstellar dust (indeed in all the frame it is visible dust, but it is very faint and can be seen only with a strong stretch of the image)\r\n\r\nwww.robertomarinoni.com",
