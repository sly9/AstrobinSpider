The nebula was catalogued by astronomer S. Sharpless in his famous \"Catalogue of HII Regions\", published in 1959. Sharpless described it as a large (have an apparent diameter of about 2 degrees) and \"bright\" nebula. \r\nThe nebula is crossed by several dark dust lanes and globules, especially on the southern part.\r\n(description credits skyfactory.org)",
