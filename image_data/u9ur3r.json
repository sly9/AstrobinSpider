    "description": "I think this structure looks like a bird.  Maybe not a sparrow, but something with wings (and a caved-in head).  This is a crop of a slightly larger image taken at 1,000mm (TOA 130 and STT-8300).  On a good night, maybe the small pixels of the ASI1600 will afford a finer display of detail.  Then again, maybe it will tahe the C11Edge to pull the finest structures out.",
