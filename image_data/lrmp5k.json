    "description": "This is the Cygnus Wall, an imaging target I've wanted to do for quite some time now.   Part of the larger North America emission nebula (located about 1,500 light years away), the Cygnus Wall is a distinct ridge of ionized hydrogen that spans about 20 light-years. The dark forms you see are clouds of cooler gas and dust that very likely harbor newly-formed or forming stars.",
