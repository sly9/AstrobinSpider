    "description": "I took my Ced 214 data and completely reprocessed it. My first go with the data was done mostly in Photoshop a few months ago. But I wanted to give it shot in Pixinsight and see if I could do a better job. This image is still in a SHO color palette, but the colors are fairly different. There's hardly any green in this image. I also did a much better job with star color this time around, and I cropped it differently to give it a different look. Finally, I was able to bring out more detail in the background nebulosity.",
