    "description": "This image was taken through a Sky-Watcher Evostar 72ED and Hotech field flattener with an ASI1600mm Pro. The image comprises:\r\n\r\nSII:      20 x 180s\r\nHa:      16 x180s \r\nOIII:    20 x 180s\r\n\r\nTotal exposure time was just under three hours. The image was processed in Pixinsight and Photoshop.\r\n\r\nI realized that I had previously imaged the Rosette in HaRGB and HOO, but never in SHO, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Unfortunately, weather and my neighbors' tall trees conspired to cut my imaging session short before I could get as many Ha shots as I'd wanted. Still, I like how it came out. Weather (and trees) permitting, I will try to get more exposure time in narrowband before I make the big move southwest.",
