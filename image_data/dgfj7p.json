    "description": "I have been grappling with methodology lately. Using cameras (the 290MM and the new 462MC) with 2.9 micron pixels means I really should not be imaging at more than about f20 , but a 2X Barlow combined with the f11 of my C14 has been giving me f26 or so!  This, combined with the generally poor seeing here these past weeks has limited my capacity to exploit the power of my new C14.\r\n\r\nI tried radical surgery therefore on the imaging train and removed the Barlow, using the 462MC and an ADC to end up at around f12, which I then stacked using 3X drizzle.  I was quite pleased with the result, but meanwhile I await a 1.5X Barlow which should I hope help me find the sweet spot!\r\n\r\nThe image shows the SPC breaking up, a dusty appearance as a whole, and, to the NE,  Olympus and the Tharsis mountains showing through.",
