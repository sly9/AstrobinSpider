    "description": "This image of m64 is about 10 hours of reprocessed LRGB data that I captured a while ago. With no clear skies, I have decided to reprocess some of my previous images and it seems as though my processing skills have improved a bit:)\r\n\r\nL:76x300s\r\nRGB:15x300s each\r\nTotal = 10.08 hours of exposure\r\n\r\nThanks for looking and clear skies,\r\n\r\nHunter",
