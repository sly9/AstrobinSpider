    "description": "In Vulpecula, not far to the west of M27, The Dumbell Nebula, lies a large area of hydrogen emission catalogued as Sh2-86 is located around the open cluster NGC6823.\r\n\r\nTo the north east (bottom left) is the smaller fainter area of hydrogen Sh2-87, while filamentary structure to the bottom left of the frame can just be seen, which was catalogued in 1976 as Du 27 by R. Dubout-Crillon. Within SH2-86 itself is the small yellowish reflection nebula NGC6820, which is small but visible on this scale. Visible to the right (south) of NGC6823 is the smaller PN Lan 21 (Kronberger PN J1944.9+2245).\r\n\r\nImage aquisition: Paul Tribe and Graeme Coates\r\nProcessing: Graeme Coates",
