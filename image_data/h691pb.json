    "description": "Hello Kids! This is a Prom Animation I shot today. I'm able to get it to you quickly because again, I'm using Chuck's Astrophotography techniques for prom animation. I'm not going to include details other than I used a 102 Stellarvue, .4 Angstrom Daystar Quantum, about 150 - 10sec videos spaced 10 seconds and PIPP at 30fps. Any other info - see chuck! Enjoy",
