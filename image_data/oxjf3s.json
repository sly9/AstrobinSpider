    "description": "Widefield mosaic of the region from the Cone nebula to Sh2-284. This was a WIP and I was hoping to be able to collect an equivalent OIII to complete a full HOO image but that is looking increasingly unlikely given the diminishing visibility of the target from this location (trees and houses) and the perma-cloud that seems to prevail here at present. The image is essentially 10 frames of 180s for each of the five frames comprising the mosaic. Maybe next year I'll get the OIII and fill in the gaps.",
