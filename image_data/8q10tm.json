    "description": "Hi everyone, after my last rendition of the entire frame of M16, I've tried to focus more on the pillars and to bring more details and contrast to it. \r\n\r\nM16 has a huge dynamic range, so it's very difficult to achieve good balance for every part of the nebula, so I thought that cropping the image and reprocessing it would be easier that the entire frame (I was very wrong). \r\n\r\nAt least for me this was a very hard image to achieve, and I hope you enjoy it\r\n\r\nClear skies!",
