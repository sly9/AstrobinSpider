    "description": "In this photo were marked three satellites of Jupiter, Io realizing a transit and soon Europe and Ganymedes would be hidden.\r\nI would like to have made a third capture showing Europe already hidden and Io leaving the front of Jupiter but the seeing worsened so much that was impossible.\r\nMany details on the planet with main highlight for the Oval BA that is with very intense color as well as the WSZ with its pink color.",
