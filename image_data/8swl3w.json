    "description": "The goal in this image is to try to get some detail on the nebula itself.  The stars were difficult to control as the OIII was quite bloated.  I guess that is because they are young and hot.  :-)\r\n\r\nI seem to be getting some decent data using the focal reducer.  Clear nights are still few and far between.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy.",
