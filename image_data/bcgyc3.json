    "description": "I've shot the ISS several times as a transit across the moon or sun, but Dana Wesbrot alerted me to this close pass of Venus that would be visible from our 14\" Edge. I certainly couldn't turn down that opportunity, but had to work around another member recording asteroid occultations with the same scope. He recorded an occultation at 8:08pm, I switched cameras to catch this at 8:13, and then he got another occultation at 8:23!\r\n\r\nThis was a burst of full-resolution JPEGs (I actually caught 8 frames of the ISS), and then I immediately dropped down to ISO 200 to knock out the glare of Venus since it would have to be a composite of multiple frames anyway.",
