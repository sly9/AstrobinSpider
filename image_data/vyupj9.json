    "description": "Really stretching the data here with only 39x180s used of the over 120x(Cabin moved in the way).  Lucky the RASA11 is fast and the ZWO 294mcP is sensitive.  The image was taken only a few days after the M81 & M82 flyby.\r\n\r\nCoddington's Nebula is sure an interesting one at full resolution.",
