    "description": "Interesting object to say the least. This data is much different from what I am used to and it is very challenging by comparison. There is a lot a like about this image, but also a lot I dislike. For example, I particularly like the colors and all the red in the nebula that the scope was able to pick up, however, I regret introducing so many artifacts in the nebula due to deconvolution followed by trying to reduce them with noise reduction.  I will definitely revisit this some day and improve upon it.",
