    "description": "The frame is unintentionally similar with <a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/249136\">my work</a> last year, difference is though this one is non-mosaic shot with Samyang 135mm F2.0 and DSLR, while the previous one was two sub mosaic with Borg 55FL and Cooled CCD.   Which one's better?   your choice, but I think this one is good enough for simpler equipment.   Samyang 135mm with F2.0, portable mount, no auto guiding.\r\n\r\n20200229 recovery from data loss: the original full size image not available, to be updated after reproduction.",
