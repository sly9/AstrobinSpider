    "description": "This is a collaboration between Wim van Berlo and me. Processing data from the Liverpool Telescope, we came up with two slightly different versions that each had some good qualities. Here we made a 50:50 mix of the nebula and I think that in this case the sum became better than the separate versions (mine is here: http://www.astrobin.com/292461/C)\r\n\r\nThis is about 4 hours of data from Bessell B, Bessell V, sdss-r and Ha filters, so a HaRGB image",
