    "description": "Now I am really tired. Finishing the color subs last night, which was quite good and spending my holiday with processing in the garden.  Now 1st version of M101 is ready. Due to light pollution gradient, imaging in Ursa major is much better than more in the south. The pic is strongly cropped. Have some smaler issues with tilt, which I will fix at full moon. I am now happy with my  new ASI 6200 mm pro, but also have to say that there is a remarkable difference between f6.3 and f7 . I am thinking about new color filters. Any ideas for me?",
