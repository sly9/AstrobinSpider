    "description": "This is the region in Orion centered on M78. \r\nThere is much to see here. Although this is a widefield (low-resolution) image- the overview is nice. Barnard's Loop (a supernova remnant) arches through the field on the left.  Just a quick note for the techno-geek astrophotogs... this is a straight RGB image- no NB H-alpha added.\r\n\r\nMore interesting... please see the companion video I made that zooms into this field and beyond:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/md0uvqWfjLI\">https://youtu.be/md0uvqWfjLI</a>",
