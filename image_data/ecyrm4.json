    "description": "NGC 281 is an 80 light-year diameter dust cloud some 10,000 light years away in the constellation of Cassiopeia. The nebula was discovered by EE Barnard in August 1883.\r\n\r\nContained within the cloud is the open cluster IC 1590.\r\n\r\nNGC 281 contains a number of dark globules within which (it is believed) new stars are forming. These are named Bok Globules after the Dutch-American astronomer â€“ Bart Bok who first described these in the 1940s.\r\n\r\nThe Pacman Nebula was photographed between 30 September and 24 October 2019 from a remote imaging rig that is jointly owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me. \r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC 140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nSII: 30 x 1200s\r\nHa: 30 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 30 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 30 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Steve Milne",
