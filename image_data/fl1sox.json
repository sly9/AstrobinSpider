    "description": "Close up to the Markarian's chain centred on the most strange galaxy there, in my opinion of course.\r\nIt's the Eyes galaxy (NGC4438) and it'is about 52 light years away and  shows a highly distorted disk, including long tidal tails due to the gravitational interactions with other galaxies in the cluster and its companion the close NGC4435 (on the top).\r\n\r\nVirgo cluster is a large cluster of galaxies, due that fact you could find other three NGC objects, other three IC and more than 30 galaxies from the PGC catalogue only on this frame.\r\nPlease check the annotated version here:\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/fl1sox/C\r\n\r\nIt was necessary a long integration time of more than 33 hours to show all this details with my equipement.\r\n\r\nAlso, on the right down side is noticeable the glow generated by the M86 galaxy that does not appear on the frame.",
