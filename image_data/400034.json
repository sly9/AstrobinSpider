    "description": "I enjoy wide angle views as they reveal the spacial relationships of the common objects we all photograph, and how one object is visually connected to another by veils of wispy dust and gas. In this scene are the familiar Rosette Nebula (Caldwell 49, 1600 PC) and the Cone Nebula (NGC2264, 830 PC). In addition there are two supernova remnants, SNR 205.5+0.5 (Monoceros Loop, 1600 PC), and SNR 206.9+2.3 (6900 PC). This stretch of Monocero is a continuum of wonderful objects linked one to another across the sky.\r\n\r\nI collected these data several months ago, but had much difficulty finding a processing approach where the star field did not overwhelm the objects of interest. This is my latest effort.",
