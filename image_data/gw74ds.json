    "description": "A quick snapshot of this beautiful constellation, near the center of the Milky Way. Scorpius crosses zenith where the image was acquired, displaying a spectable of the southern winter skies. This image was shot with really modest gear, and displays a busy stellar field, with lots of clouds of gas and dust in the Milky Way - the Scorpion features many deep sky objects!\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, comments and suggestions are more than welcome in the comments section. \r\n\r\nDate: 18 July 2020\r\nLocation: Observatory, MG, Brazil. Rural Skies (Bortle 3, calculated SQM ~21.6)\r\nCamera: Canon EOS T5/1200D (mod) at ISO 1600 & ISO 6400\r\nOptics: Canon 40mm f/2.8 STM, operated at f/3.5\r\nMount: Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer, tracking.\r\nExposure Detail: 21x120s, total 42min.",
