Took a long time to come to this version of the image. It is in a way a mix from different versions as I blended some small galaxies over from the earlier processing attempts and bigger ones are from the latest :) When I started imaging this group of galaxies I was not sure if I am going to make it during this season, but the weather gods were merciful and allowed me to gather all the data I wanted, so here it is. The only sad thing is that Holmberg VIII was juuuust outside the FoV, it was in some L frames, but sadly I couldn't keep it. Admittedly I planned it this way, I thought that if I try to include it, the other galaxies might suffer because of collimation in corners. Speaking of collimation, it was during imaging of this target that I realized I used to screw up my collimation every single time because I rotated focuser.. After realizing my mistake, collimation became very good indeed, not perfect, but compared to what I used to have- very very nice.\r\n\r\nMore info in my website",
