    "description": "NGC 7424, a spiral galaxy located in the constellation of Grus approximately 37.5 million light years away. Data for this object was collected over two years, not because I planned to but because I forgot about the data that I collected in 2018 until I found it again in 2020 lurking about on my hard drive. By lucky happenstance it just happened to be the right time of year to start imaging the object again so I kept going to collect more data. This was fortunate because NGC 7424 is rather small in the field of view on my imaging set up and by capturing more data this enabled me to use drizzle integration in post processing. This allowed me to crop in to the main subject without losing too much resolution.\r\n\r\nBecause of my generous field of view (1.5d x 1d), I had the opportunity to try a slightly different composition here so have deliberately placed the galaxy in a commanding position in the corner of the frame. The remaining field is speckled with bright stars of various colours and numerous galaxies. which contribute well to the overall scene. The mouse over shows some of the many small galaxies there are that populate this busy field.",
