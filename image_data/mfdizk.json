    "description": "Another image from the same night as <a href='https://www.astrobin.com/efown7/0/' target='_blank'>my recent Jupiter post</a>.\r\n\r\nSeeing had actually improved by the time I was ready to image Saturn but unfortunately this didn't last. Nonetheless, the captures I was able to complete produced a pleasing amount of detail around the polar hexagon and vortex without too much noise evident.\r\n\r\nThere are hints of possible storm activity in the broader polar region, but unfortunately I was not able to collect enough data to produce an animation and confirm this.\r\n\r\nThis image represents a de-rotation of 6 x 120s captures @ 60fps, with the top 20% of frames stacked from each capture.",
