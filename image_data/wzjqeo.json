    "description": "Going deep in the Cocoon Nebula\r\n \r\nDuring my stay in Southern France (where the skies get much darker than at home in the Netherlands) I had a clear spell from August 23 to 26 and decided to go deep on the Cocoon Nebula. Imaged with a Takahashi ε-180ED and Nikon D810a. Total integration time is 21 hours and 10 minutes of which 8 hours and 10 minutes through a 3.5 nm Hα filter (during the period the moon was above the horizon).",
