    "description": "This is the first light with my new ASI 2600mm, and I have to say I'm fairly impressed!  At only 6 hours, the data was remarkably clean and easy to process.  I've always wanted to shoot this area in a bit higher resolution than I have in the past, so it seemed like a good first light target.\r\n\r\nCopyright Casey Good/Steve Timmons",
