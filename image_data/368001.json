    "description": "NGC 55 in Sculptor\r\n\r\nFirst time I manage to capture images with such a long integration time.\r\nFirst image with my new mount after several nights of setup and tuning. \r\n\r\nHappy with the result, even if RGB bin2 subs brought more noise than I expected. \r\n\r\nI found interesting the irregular shape and content of this galaxy, trying to get as much details as I could of this unexpected chaos of dust, stars and gas. Magellanic spiral Galaxy having only one arm.\r\n\r\nCropped version & full size",
