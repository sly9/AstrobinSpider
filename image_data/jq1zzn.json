    "description": "Target:\r\nRunning Chicken Nebula IC2944.\r\nDistance to Earth: 6500 light years.\r\nIC 2944, also known as the Running Chicken Nebula or the λ Centauri Nebula, is an open cluster with an associated emission nebula found in the constellation Centaurus, near the star λ Centauri. \r\nIt features Bok globules, which generally speaking can be a site for active star formation however there is no evidence of star formation in these ones.  Its strange nickname comes from the bird-like shape of its brightest region in the centre of this beautiful nebula.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquisition:\r\n2 nights standing in the backyard, 19th Jan & 2nd Feb 2021.\r\nBortle Class 6 Sky in Victoria, Australia.\r\nLights: 11x360s Ha, 11x360s Oiii, 10x360s Sii, 3x90s Red, 3x90s Green, 3x90s Blue.\r\n80 Darks, No Flats or Bias.\r\n\r\n\r\nClear skies ;)\r\n\r\nMy site:\r\nhttps://www.onebreathtakinguniverse.com",
