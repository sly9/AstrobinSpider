    "description": "Home to hundreds of newly formed stars, this reflection complex is, well ...  exactly that, complex!  I was happy to be rewarded with some indications of this activity.  I spotted variable stars (more to come on that) and hints of variability in some of the nebula.  \r\n\r\nIt took me over a month of shooting through pea soup to get this far.   Far and away, this was the most challenging target I've attempted from my light polluted back yard.   The weather did not cooperate either.   Bad transparency helped me to decide on dumping tons of data.  Still, I was able to manage many hours on this.  I'm afraid it will take many more to reach the vision I had of this area.   I've also come across calibration issues with the ASI1600 in the form of banding.  So I'll recalibrating everything in and restacking once I get new Dark and Bias masters... fingers crossed.   \r\n\r\nEnjoy... hopefully this is just a start on this one.  ",
