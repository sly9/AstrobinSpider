    "description": "Gum 15 is an emission nebula in the constellation Vela that lies, roughly, 3,000 light-years from Earth.  Although most of the beautiful red colors come from the hydrogen gas being excited by the central star HD 74804 there are also some nice blue reflections coming from the dust in the nebula reflecting the blue light of HD 74804.   There's also some very nice dark structures within the nebula.\r\nThis image is a Pro Data Set from Telescope Live's PlaneWave CDK24/FLI ProLine PL9000 at El Sauce, Chile.  It consists of 40 each RGB @600s.  The data was excellent quality.  I processed this totally in Pixinsight.\r\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\r\nTom",
