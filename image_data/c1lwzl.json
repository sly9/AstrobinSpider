    "description": "This is a two panel mosaic of dark nebulae in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The relatively long total integration time at f/2 brought out quite a lot of colour and dust. The nebula to the left is Barnard 14 (containing the bright IC2087) and the one to the right is Barnard 10. The long stretch of dark nebulosity at the bottom right is NGC1539.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia: The Taurus Molecular Cloud is a molecular cloud in the constellations Taurus and Auriga. This cloud hosts a stellar nursery containing hundreds of newly formed stars. The Taurus Molecular Cloud is only 140 pc (430 ly) away from earth, making it the nearest large star formation region. It also reveals characteristics that make it ideal for detailed physical studies. It has been important in star formation studies at all wavelengths.",
