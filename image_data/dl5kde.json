    "description": "At 5,500 light years distant, the Cat's Paw nebula NGC 6334 is an emission nebula with a red colour that originates from an abundance of ionised hydrogen atoms. Alternatively known as the Bear Claw Nebula, stars nearly ten times the mass of our Sun have been born there in only the past few million years. Pictured here is a deep field image of the Cat's Paw Nebula in light emitted by hydrogen, oxygen, and sulphur. (text from Apod).\r\n\r\nThird finished image from the big Tak/QSI 6162 combo now that the field field is flat (after considerable re-machining of the focuser faces).\r\n\r\nI wanted to feature the abundance of Ha in this region, so have deliberately allowed the background Ha to show through. To me it resembles a genie pouring out of the magic lamp!\r\n\r\nHa - 11x1200secs\r\nO3-17 x 1800 secs\r\nS2- 10x1200secs\r\nRG&B 10x180 secs ea.\r\nCaptured via Ekos on a Mac.\r\n\r\nProcessed in APP & PS CC 202 with Topaz NR\r\nTaken from my light polluted suburban backyard in Melbourne, Victoria.",
