    "description": "With wings that span about 250 light-years, the Seagull Nebula soars across the border between constellations Canis Major and Monoceros. The head of the gull, cataloged NGC 2327, is a dusty region surrounding a massive star (the region is also cataloged Gum 1, vdB 93, and Sh2-292). The broad, sweeping wings are cataloged IC 2177.\r\n\r\nThe Ha, OIII, and SII data for this image were collected in January 2019. This object appears just above the roof of my house for a few hours a night, so gathering the data was a challenge. To maximize the few collection hours available, I did 2x2 binning of the OIII and SII data, using the channels primarily for color mapping. Much of the nebular structure is seen in the Ha channel, which was collected 1x1. In reviewing the folders on my storage drive this week I found some “long-lost” RGB data (also collected 2x2) that I collected at the same time and had never processed (yes it is still cloudy nearly every night here in Monterey, CA so I have time to cleanup). This image combines that 2019 narrowband data with the newly discovered RGB data in an NBRGB rendition. To achieve a more “natural” color palette, I used Steve Milne’s natural narrowband SHO formula.",
