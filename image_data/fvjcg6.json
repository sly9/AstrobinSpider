    "description": "This is a comparison of Saturn 2019 (8th May, 19:32 UT) with 2020 (31st July, 13:41 UT), which represent my two best captures from the respective years.\r\n\r\nThe differences are amazing.\r\n\r\nNote the change in pitch of the rings, such that, as they are now narrowing, it is possible to see the south pole in the 2020 image and it happens to be a beautiful blue colour. You can also see the planet through the Cassini Division in this image :-D.\r\n\r\nThe Hexagonal Polar Vortex (HPV), so clear in the 2019 was less so in 2020 as the pole is pitched further away from us and the North Polar Region has changed colour from green to a brown-red colour, where the contrast with the HPV is lessened.\r\n\r\nYou can tell that the 2020 image was acquired soon after after opposition (July 20th) as the shadow of the planet on the rings is to the left and small, where the 2019 image was acquired two months before opposition (July 9th), so the shadow is large and to the right. Note that there is more structure in the atmosphere visible in the 2020 image. \r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to see what 2021 brings as the rings narrow further, the southern polar regions become more visible and the HPV is less apparent.",
