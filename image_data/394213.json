    "description": "My intent was to capture this as a mosaic with my CDK14 at SRO, but there have been maybe 10 hours this year that I could shoot from SRO due to incredibly bad weather.  So with 4 clear days in Portland Oregon, I trotted the FSQ106 and my STT8300 out to my city backyard to get this last narrowband object of the season.\r\n\r\nThe image contains 14.66 hours of FSQ106/STT8300 data from Portland + 3 hours I found from my old Los Angeles backyard.  I had 7.66 hours of data on just the central section taken with the CDK14 and STX16803 from SRO.  \r\n\r\nThough there were 4 different camera orientations and 2 vastly different image scales, CCDStack was able to register and integrate all of the data.  \r\n\r\nThe mix here is Ha for luminance, SII  for Red, SII+10%Ha+OIII for Green, and OIII for Blue.  As is typical of SNR's, there is a bright OIII shell just outside the main shock front.  To preserve that, I added OIII back as a brighten layer much like we add Ha to galaxies.  The blue/cyan gasses on the right are blue because there is some OIII reflection there and there is no SII to color the area.  In truth that would be red from Ha but then almost the whole thing would be red in broadband.",
