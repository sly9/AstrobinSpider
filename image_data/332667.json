    "description": "Here we have a look at M95, even on a 14.5\" scope this is quite a small (barred spiral) galaxy ~38Mly away.  Despite the challenge, I think it is a nice example of a SB(r)b galaxy and some nice details are showing.\r\nIn order to realise the detail and keep to a decent size image I had to first ensure the scale of the image was sufficient to work out through drizzling all the data.  Once complete I was able gently, through many iterations release the detail that was present.  This is certainly a good example of many smaller iterations of process applications having more impact than a few larger ones.  Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nPS: For the pixel peepers out there is a strange blue star towards the bottom of the image - I wondered what I had done wrong .  Having reviewed this is actually correct and not an aberration, It is SDSS J104429.50+113042.0 an RR lyrae variable star - the SDSS data shows this to be the correct colour.......",
