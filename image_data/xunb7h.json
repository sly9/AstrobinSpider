    "description": "M33 is a spiral galaxy 3 million light years away from our planet, located in the constellation of the triangle. It is the second closest galaxy to ours and although it appears very large from a telescope, it is actually small in size compared to other galaxies in the universe. A bright H-II region of the galaxy is also visible, which had already been cataloged by William Hershel and which appears to be spectrally similar to the famous Orion nebula. This region appears to have a diameter of about 1500 light years, in which star formation phenomena occur.",
