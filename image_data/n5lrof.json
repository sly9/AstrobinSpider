    "description": "This past week has been exceptional for astroimaging in my location (outskirts of Buenos Aires city). Clear skies, new moon, good transparency and excellent seeing many nights in a row. I acquired in two sessions the best SII data ever,  109 5-minute subs with a median FWHM better than 1.4\", and it shows in the final result. Composition is (Lsynth)SHO, where Lsynth is the results of combining the L from SHO with Ha (40/60). Total integration is almost 24 hours. As usual, I used an AP 6.6\" fluorite apo refractor and a QHY600 on top an AP1100.",
