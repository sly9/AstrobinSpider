    "description": "Strange bedfellows indeed.  \r\nThis pair of objects are linked by clouds of Ha, but appear as wildly differing shapes.\r\nTwo panel mosaic with the bottom data captured almost exactly a year ago and the top captured last night under (and almost next to) a full moon resulting in another trip to gradient city.\r\nAverage seeing & some thin cloud meant the two data sets are a challenge to process as one.\r\nI plan to eventually add RGB to this but not until under a dark sky again!\r\nTempted to add another panel or two to the right to include the infamous WOLF'S HEAD nebula.\r\nApprox 6 hrs per panel, 30min subs. \r\nCaptured from suburban Melbourne.",
