    "description": "A fabulous Arp galaxy interacting pair. 200 2.5 second images stacked live in SharpCap, with the images left a little raw as they were viewed live on my laptop. Image rotation during the capture run distorts the far right edge of the field and there is a little vignetting on the for left and bottom. Still working on tuning my flats for my telescope and the Rev Imager. \r\nNote several background galaxies in the field as well as the two NGC and IC 4356. A tiny 870 mly distant edge-on PGC 2101092 can be at the end of the upper right tidal tail of NGC 5394 and a little to its right is the faintest catalogued galaxy in the view, PGC 4004111, at magnitude 18.7 and estimated to be 2.3 bly away. At the center top is elliptical galaxy PGC 2102129 and the fainter PGC 2102430 to its immediate left and I also suspect that the smudge to its north is also a distant faint galaxy, but its not plotted in the expanded galaxy database in SkySafari.",
