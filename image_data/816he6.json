    "description": "This field of view has been a real challenge for myself and my friend Mustafa Aydin, who did most of the post processing.  The abundance of stars presented great challenge in showing the dusty B168 as well as the H2 regions in the field. Although, we had 14 hours of Ha data, we were not able to mix it with the LRGB data to our satisfaction so we left this to a later date. We had to reduce and de-emphasize the tiny stars in the field which some purist can find unacceptable. We are, of course open to c/c.  However, to appreciate the image please make sure to view it at its max resolution.\n\nClear skies to you all.",
