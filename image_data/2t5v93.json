    "description": "M97 - The Owl Nebula\n\nThe Owl Nebula (also known as Messier 97, M97 or NGC 3587) is a starburst (\"planetary\") nebula approximately 2,030 light years away in the northern constellation Ursa Major.Its light reaching our neighbourhood is about 8,000 years old. It is approximately circular in cross-section with faint internal structure. It was formed from the outflow of material from the stellar wind of the central star as it evolved along the asymptotic giant branch. The nebula is arranged in three concentric shells/envelopes, with the outermost shell being about 20–30% larger than the inner shell. A mildly owl-like appearance of the nebula is the result of an inner shell that is not circularly symmetric, but instead forms a barrel-like structure aligned at an angle of 45° to the line of sight.\n\nEquipment\ncelestronuniverse Edge HD 8”\nzwoasi 294mm, 224MC, OAG, ASIAIR PRO, EAF. & EFW \nAstronomik HA, OIII, & RGB Filters \nskywatcherusa EQ6-R Mount\n\nAcquisition\nHA-8hrs\nOIII - 8hrs\nR-2hrs\nG-2hrs\nB-2hrs\n-22hrs Total Integration Time\n-50 Darks & 50 Flats\n-Gain 120\n-Temp-20c\n-Bortle 5",
