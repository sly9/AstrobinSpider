    "description": "Abell 39 is a low surface brightness planetary nebula in the constellation Hercules. Abell 39 is magnitude 13.7 with the central star at magnitude 15.5. It lies at a distance of 6,800 light years and has a diameter of 2.5 light years. Abell 39 goes by the designations PN A66 39, PN ARO 180, PK 047+42.1 and PN G047.0+42.4. The planetary nebula is nearly symmetrical and was George Abell's 39th entry into his catalog of planetary nebula.. Within the field are many faint galaxies. I included an annotated image which  you can see on the weblink.  It names a few but there are lots and lots of them un-catalogued. \r\n\r\nThe above image is a crop of a much larger field of view.  It was taken from my backyard observatory with a Stellarvue SVX 152T refractor and ZWO ASI 6200 camera at 1x1 binning at 1/2 frame ROI and a resolution of .64 arcsec/pixel. The image was processed in PixInsight.  Check out the web link for a uncropped full res version.",
