    "description": "Wolf-Rayet stars are massive stars that have reached their final stable phase. They are ferociously bright, hot stars doomed to an unavoidable collapse in a supernova explosion. They are a rare breed.  At any point in time, only one in a hundred million stars makes the cut to be classified as a Wolf-Rayet.  \r\n\r\nWR153ab (=HD211853, =HIP110154), a Wolf-Rayet, resides in the bright HII region of the Lion Nebula Sh2-132.  The annotated version of this image shows its location.  Wolf-Rayets can have strong stellar winds.  WR153ab is believed to be responsible for the ionization front marked by the bluish 4â€™ wide arc to its south.\r\n\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.4612.pdf",
