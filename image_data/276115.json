    "description": "The Rosette Nebula is a cropped version depicting the inner working of the core showing its amazing inner detail and dust cores.   After 18 attempts of running Pixinsight AIP script I think  this is my best SHO palette using the program . I know narrowband is very subjective and their is really no wrong image and is left up too artistic interpretation, but this image really speaks to me.\r\n  Please click on image to see the full resolution data.\r\n  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.!!",
