    "description": "Excellent seeing conditions. This is a second attempt with my EdgeHD 11 and new Sky-Watcher EQ6-R Pro after a near-failure the previous morning because of clouds. My primary use for this mount will be for deep sky imaging, but I can also use it for planetary imaging with the EdgeHD 11 in times I would've used the EdgeHD 8 and Advanced VX.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n<ul><li>Both the North & South Equatorial Belts appear faded except for their southern edges.</li>\r\n<li>The Equatorial Zone, except for the southern edge, is still orange.</li>\r\n<li>Oval BA has a slight orange color.</li></ul>",
