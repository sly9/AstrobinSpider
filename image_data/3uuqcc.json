    "description": "Finally i was able to finish my <a href=\"https://astrob.in/idjljk/0/\">4-panel mosaic project of the heart nebula</a>. \r\nAfter lots of interruptions due to bad weather i collected enough OIII data to work with. To be honest OIII data is horrible and it seems like every non cloudy night is around full moon.  \r\nTo counter-attack the mediocre quality of the OIII data i downscaled the image using IntegerResample in PixInsight with a resample factor of 2.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that this was orginally planned as a true 2x2 panel mosaic but in the end i added data of two other images as well. So in total the following data went into this image:\r\n\r\nHa Panels:\r\n- 4x 100x180s; Darks: 100, Flats: 50, Flat Darks: 50\r\n- 1x 150x180s; Darks: 100, Flats: 50, Flat Darks: 50 (data from this <a href=\"https://astrob.in/wr1v9i/0/\">image</a>)\r\n- 1x 135x120s; Darks: 50, Flats: 40, Bias: 200 (data from this <a href=\"https://astrob.in/377449/D/\">image</a>)\r\n\r\nOIII Panels:\r\n- 4x 100x180s; Darks: 100, Flats: 50, Flat Darks: 50\r\n- 1x 135x180s; Darks: 100, Flats: 50, Flat Darks: 50 (data from this <a href=\"https://astrob.in/wr1v9i/0/\">image</a>)\r\n- 1x 121x120s; Darks: 50, Flats: 40, Bias: 200 (data from this <a href=\"https://astrob.in/377449/D/\">image</a>)\r\n\r\nTotal integration time: ~62 hours\r\n\r\nLooking at the final image and the huge amount of integration time that went into it i'm a bit disappointed. But i mainly blame the OIII data and my limited processing skills for that. :-)",
