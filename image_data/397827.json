    "description": "This image is a close-up from 26-MAR-2019.  The Earth is shown as a scale reference in the bottom right of the image.\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\r\nThe sun rotates slowly, about 24 days on average.  This is variable depending on where you look because there are no fixed features to reference.  This prominence has been rounding the corner and coming into view over the last few days.  I’m looking forward to seeing the surface underneath this thing.  It’s huge!!",
