    "description": "This image was made during an astrophotography trip in 2018 to Namibia. I was amazed by the magnificent southern sky. Miss it already. It was quite a challenge to dig out the dust clouds from the dense starfield, next time I'm heading for a mosaic. \r\n\r\nThe Rho Ophiuchi nebula complex and Antares region are beautiful, gigantic clouds of colorful cosmic dust and gas, in constellations Ophiuchi and Scorpio.",
