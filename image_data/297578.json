    "description": "It is my first picture with my A7s, taken in 2 nights.\r\nThis is one of my favorite place in the sky and I was in a hurry to shoot it now that my A7s with the Samyang 135 mm make the perfect field of view to integrate all these objects!\r\nThe target is very low in France, so it is covered by light pollution.\r\nI used an Astronomik CLS-CCD filter who does the job, but eats every single hue of yellow...\r\nSo I expected more color and I'm not very happy with this result.\r\nI'll try without the filter next time.\r\nA7s, 3200 ISO, Samyang 135 at f2.8, 213x30 sec.\r\n\r\nCS, David.",
