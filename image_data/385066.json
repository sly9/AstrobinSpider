    "description": "First time giving Astro-Modified Nikon D500 a \"decent\" treatment :) - this time, with FSQ-85EDP and riding a real astrophotography mount. Thought that I owe the D500 this experience with 2019's first shot. \r\n\r\nThis is the camera got me started on Astrophotography.\r\n\r\nIt's actually the \"First-Light\" event for the BabyQ. The flexible coupling to connect the AF motor had not arrived yet. So, back to the good old days with manual focus. I'd say with William Optics Bahtinov Mask and supported by Bahtinov Grabber, the focus was pretty accurate.\r\n\r\n<B>Pre-processing of Masters</B>\r\n\r\n<I>- Calibration / Integration, Astro Pixel Processor\r\n- HDR Composition, PixInsight\r\n- DynamicCrop, PixInsight\r\n- MultiscaleLinearTransformation (Denoise), PixInsight\r\n- ScreenTransferFunction / HistogramTransformation, PixInsight.</I>\r\n\r\n<B>Post-processing</B>\r\n\r\n<I>- Final Touch-up, Photoshop</I>",
