    "description": "Galaxy season is continuing! This beautiful  small group of galaxies in the constellation of Leo is one of the most known and bright one on the night sky. I kept the subs short at 120s because  it was windy so I did not want to lose to much data. 128 out of 150 shots were keepers. It's not bad considering the Avalon mount with its fully belt transmission is not the best for windy condition... Hope you like the result. CS",
