    "description": "This image reminds me of a fish (or a jellyfish) swimming among kelp fronds in the ocean. Can you see it?\r\n\r\nI used the RGB master as the foundation and then blended in the Ha and OIII data in PixInsight using PixelMath. One of my goals was to keep the stars natural looking. I used Ha at about 40% strength for the luminance channel. I found that this gave a three-dimensional look to the larger surrounding nebula.",
