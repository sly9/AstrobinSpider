    "description": "NGC 6769 6770 and 6771 are a trio of galaxies located between 190 and 200 million light years away in the constellation of Pavo.\r\nThe trio have been interacting and 6769 appears to have collided with 6770 as evidenced by the presence of many star forming regions.\r\nNGC 6771 has a very unusual boxy shape that is rarely seen in galaxies.\r\nImaged in LRGB on our CDK 1000 at El Sauce, Obstech, Chile.\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby in collaboration with Roberto Colombari\r\nSystem Control Software: Voyager by Leo Orazi.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/masterdarksastro/",
