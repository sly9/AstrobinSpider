    "description": "Sometimes I ask myself \"How far can I push an image before it completely falls apart?\"\r\n\r\nWell this was my attempt at pushing deconvolution as far as I could without too much falling apart. There are stars with some ringing artefacts but that was because of poor star masking. I was mostly just playing around, picked up the worst offenders (which for the most part took very good) but I was astonished by the increased level of detail.\r\n\r\nNow, by over the top what I mean is 150 iterations of deconvolution.\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/full/324394/B/\r\n\r\nAbove is a link to a full version I've done of this with virtually no processing. This region may be a crop but I didn't want to have to do 150 iterations of deconvolution on a 65mp drizzled Ha image.\r\n\r\nVersion A is just deconvolve.\r\nVersion B is an after thought where I figured I may as well go the whole hog and do some sharpening.",
