    "description": "I animated the 5 RGB runs I made on 2020-09-24. I love seeing the planet rotate like this and I always feel it makes the features that much more real to my brain. Note the bump to the right at the terminator/ limb, which is Olympus Mons. It can be seen, with the clouds around Arsia Mons further south, rotating out of view as the sun sets for them. Meanwhile, Syrtis Major is appearing on the other limb.",
