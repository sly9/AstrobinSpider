    "description": "After weeks of clouds I had a few hours of clear sky again. My goal was to test the dynamic range of my new camera, so I acquired a lot of 120sec exposures or Orion at unity gain. For safety I also did some 30sec exposures, but they are not added to this dataset.\r\nI find it extremely impressive what is possible from my bortle 8 city sky! The L-eNhance makes it possible.\r\nFor this image I first stacked everything in APP, but I extracted Luminance, OIII and Ha with the different debayer algorithms and I also used a 0.6 scale to fight the noise. Then I combined everything again in a painful fight of thousand sliders. Finalization was done in LR, PS and the mighty Topaz Denoise.",
