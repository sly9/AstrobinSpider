    "description": "I have been struck how different the Pacman looks in RGB compared to NB. To me it looks like a red dust ball in RGB while it looks like an opening into another brighter world in NB (at least in Hubble palette). So here I explored how it may look like in a mix of RGB and NB data.\r\n\r\nThis is 15 hours of HaOiiiSii data collected by Steve and Lis Milne merged with 3 hours of RGB data collected by me. After a lot fumbling with trying to mix different filters to different channels I ended up making a Hubble image of the NB data and mixed this 50:50 with the RGB image and the tweaked the colours so it resembles the RGB palette. Probably because there is so much data from different sources there was not much noise to deal with. There was more work in dealing with the stars since as usual these were considerably larger in RGB.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to the Milnes for allowing me to mess with their data.\r\n\r\nThe original versions with acquisition data are found here:\r\nNB: http://www.astrobin.com/320125/B/\r\nRGB: http://www.astrobin.com/274031/F/\r\n\r\nIn version B I brought out a bit more nebulosity and dust around the nebula and in C there is a bit more colour to the stars",
