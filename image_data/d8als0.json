    "description": "Hi everybody!\nToday's image is really nothing fancy but it's the only image I was able to get after this very long and restrictive pandemy...\nI was partecipating a small star party in Italy for just 2 days in the good sky of Umbria. During the first night we've had a very dark sky with good seeing but full of passing clouds so no long exposures where possible and I've spent the whole night taking \"just for fun\" 60\" RGB's of very bright an famous Messier objects to show to people. The second night was clear of clouds but with a very bad transparency and a lot of dust and sand in the lower atmosphere due to very high pressure, strong wind gusts also make long exposure impossible. The seeing was excellent (in some moments even below 1\") but really no dark object was really an option. At about 2.30 A.M. the sky was clear enough to try to make some shots but the night time was just about 2 hours at least... I decided to go for something near the zenith and try \"just\" RGB for personal fun and I've chosen the Sadr region containing IC1318 \"butterfly\" nebula. The end result is just 4x600\" exposures in each R, G and B filter and the last images laks of contrast due to the incoming down. I was surpised anyway from the results... The image is nice and pleasent to the eyes and the seeing helped a lot. Low contrasts and light scattering is present still due to dust and vapours but, a part from some halos on the stars, it helped the star colors. Anyway, this is my result on IC1318 with only 40' of datas for channel in straight RGB.\nThanks for watching!",
