    "description": "Vinicius Martins and I captured this image of Saturn from my home star party during daytime, just after sunrise. The post processing was made by Vinicius. It's slightly out of focus, but we think it turned out quite well considering the fact that we were on a rush.\n\n- Telescope: GSO 8\" f/5 Newtonian (mine)\n- Mount: Sky-Watcher EQ5 (from Vinicius)\n- PowerMate: TeleVue PM 4x (from Caetano)\n- Camera: ZWO ASI290MM (from Vinicius)\n- Filter wheel: ZWO EFW (from Caetano)\n- Filters: Optolong LRGB (from Caetano)\n- Software: FireCapture, AutoStakkert!3, Registax 6, WinJupos and PhotoShop.",
