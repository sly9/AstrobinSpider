    "description": "UPDATE 20/12/2018: Reprocessed with new workflow\r\nUPDATE 21/06/2018: Added OIII data for M8 and reworked completely as HOO with RGB stars.\r\n\r\nOriginal description 05/06/2017:\r\nThe Lagoon and Trifid nebulae are two very bright stellar nurseries, surrounded by gas and dust. I also included the open cluster M21 near the top of the frame.\r\n\r\nFrom my northern location, these hydrogen regions only reach a maximum altitude of 14-16 degrees. I captured this a couple months ago along with some RGB, unfortunately not enough for a good HaRGB image. I ended up reprocessing the Ha only. The DarkStructureEnhance script in PixInsight worked really well on this image!",
