    "description": "This picture started from a classic capture of the Chromosphere, in H-alpha frequency, of the active  AR12501, with his main spot, taken on  February 20, 2016.\r\n I insisted on keeping the deepness effect of the plasma shapes, by a specific processing, using the various shadow intensity on various levels.\r\nFinishing with using false colors as close to the H-alpha specific color but keeping the hot points which marks more active areas.\r\nAlso, I increased the hot area brightest, near to those very active area, underlining much more the 3-D effect.",
