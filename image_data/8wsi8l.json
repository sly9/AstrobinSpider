    "description": "This is a beautiful star forming region containing reflection, emission and dark nebulae and can be found just to the East of M8, The Lagoon Nebula in Sagittarius.  Approximately 5,000 light years distant, it is part of a fascinating system of star forming regions.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to learn more about and improve my work with longer focal length imaging during the galaxy season.  Since the season has for the most part passed, I though why not see if some skills I have been working to improve and with this telescope and camera combination translates well to other types of objects.  \r\n\r\nAlthough this is quite low at my location at 33deg N latitude, I was quite pleased with the outcome of this image.  Perhaps a little on the saturated side of the line but hey, what is wrong with a little eye candy on occasion?\r\n\r\nComments and criticism always welcome and clear skies, good health to everyone!",
