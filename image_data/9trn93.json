    "description": "Added some more data to a previous SHO narrowband M20. All shot in very moonlit conditions and some of the data was a first light for the new Moonlite focuser. I was also fiddling with back focus so the orientation of one set of subs severely limited the field of view. Was happy in the end to get what I got and be able to throw together an image :-)",
