    "description": "I decided to reprocess the Carina nebula, with a new Luminance and a slightly different palette. I was much more careful with the processing, trying to preserve the transparency of the nebulosity. Inspired by Diego's version, I find that this orientation gives a much more dynamic immersion. I think it has something to do with the way we interpret perspective and probably the vanishing point  (le point de fugue) is more favorably placed with this orientation.",
