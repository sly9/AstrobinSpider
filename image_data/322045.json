    "description": "I have perhaps stretched things a little too far and introduced some noise which would require a lot more exposure time to smooth out given the same degree of stretching. However, there is 4 hours of S2, 2 hours 40mins of Ha and 4 hours of O3 for a total integration time of 10 hours and 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nInterestingly the S2 signal was noticeably stronger than the O3, so for those wishing to Bi-Colour this one please note. Teamviewer12 performed well last night enabling me to enjoy the comfort of my lounge for much of the session.",
