    "description": "NGC55 is one of the great galaxies of the southern hemisphere, located in the constellation Sculptor next to the border to Phoenix. At a distance of 7 million lightyears, it is one of the nearest galaxies beyond the local group. Usually counted to belong to the Sculptor group of galaxies, it is the one next to us of these.  At a dimension of 32x6 minutes of arc, classified as an SB spiral seen edge on, its a streak of the full size of the moon. Resolved are knots of blue giant stars and some of the big HII emission nebulas. There is no clear band of absorbing material as senn in other edge on spirals, but patches of dust. The brightness distribution is highly asymmetric, the weak bulge being totally off center. That could well be a sign of disturbance, as the other big spiral NGC300 is only about 1 milion lightyears away from it and there may be interaction going on.\r\n\r\nHere presented is a crop serving as lead pic, a full field at100% resolution and an annotated version of the full field naming lots of background galaxies.\r\n\r\nThis picture was taken with a Boren-Simon carbon Newtonian at f/4 that unfortunately showed a lot of astigmatism. Together with its float glass primary that had the focus running with cooling temperatures, it led to distorted color frames in R and B channel, the distortion turning 90Â° in between. So the brighter stars got vividly colored red and blue \"ears\", which led me to call them the Clownstars. They are presented as a bonus, and how I did the retouche. Using borrowed equipment can certainly add an extra adventurous note to an astronomical expedition!\r\n\r\nSouth is up!",
