    "description": "At aout 500 light-years away the Rho Ophiuchi star clouds are well in front of the nearby globular star cluster M4. M4 is to the right of Antaries. \r\n\r\nIt is interesting the number of different nebula and object types concentrated in this patch of sky. The bluish colors are reflection nebula, the redish are emission nebula the darker are obscuring dust clouds, there are bright stars, VdB objects, a handfull of globular clusters, and dust permitting a couple of galaxies. Turely a spictacular patch of night sky.  There is EM-radiation and light emitted at every wavelength from radio waves to gamma-rays...\r\n\r\nThis is a  6-panel mosaic that was integrated most clear moonless nights over the past several months. A project I have started several times over the years with varous instruments and will continue to work with this one.\r\n\r\nThe astrograph is a home made catadioptric 8\" F/2.6.\r\n\r\nNorth is up",
