    "description": "My first attempt to image Andromeda :)\r\n\r\nAlso for the first time with the AP Quad 0,72 compressor on the TEC-160FL. The field is not 100% perfect yet and there is still a very small distance error to the image plane which I could not solve yet.\r\n\r\nStill on a huge learning curve with PixInsight. I tried several new procedures to keep the signal clean during the whole workflow and to get most out of the data which is easier said than done when you follow 5219 different tutorials :)\r\n\r\nThis is a LRGB workflow with the addition of continuum subtracted H-alpha. All frames are processed in PixInsight and a little color-grading in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nHope you like it!",
