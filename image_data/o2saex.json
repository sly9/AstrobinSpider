    "description": "From Wikipedia - NGC 1514 is a planetary nebula in the zodiac constellation of Taurus, Distance estimates for this nebula vary widely, with a range of 650–980 ly (200–300 pc) considered the most plausible.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered by William Herschel on November 13, 1790, describing it as \"a most singular phenomenon\" and forcing him to rethink his ideas on the construction of the heavens. Up until this point Herschel was convinced that all nebulae consisted of masses of stars too remote to resolve, but now here was a single star \"surrounded with a faintly luminous atmosphere.",
