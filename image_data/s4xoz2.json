    "description": "A while ago we had a great opportunity to photograph multiple celestial objects in conjunction. This time, Comet C/2020 M3 ATLAS would pass in front of the Flame and Tadpoles Nebula in Cepheus. Unfortunately we were totally clouded out (and still are) so I was forced to make a composite of some older data sitting on my harddrive of the two celestial objects.",
