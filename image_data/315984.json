    "description": "This object is a dark nebula in the constellation of Cygnus, framed with open star cluster NGC 6871 (5000 light years away) in the upper left.  The central dark nebula is B147, but a number of other dark nebula are also visible in this image.  In addition, there are a number of small faint emission fronts in the same proximity.  In fact, I believe this is the only dark nebula that I have imaged with full narrowband.  The image is supplemented with RGB star color.  I really like this area, with the numerous bright stars, dark nebulae, and emission regions.  I almost gave up on it during processing because the colors and details were very faint and difficult to extract, but somehow it came together and I am happy with the end result.",
