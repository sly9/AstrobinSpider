    "description": "Mars after midnight on Sunday 4 Oct 2020 AEST - annotated version.\r\n\r\nA total of 10,550 frames make up this view of Red Planet's volcano hemisphere. Lucky imaging during a period of good seeing between 12:31 and 12:51 am Canberra time.\r\n\r\nOlympus Mons, the largest mountain in the Solar System, rises over Amazonis Planitia in the north west. Central summit caldera spanning 80x60 km is resolved here, as is the square boundary of the shield volcano. Tharsis Ridge peaks of Ascraeus and Pavonis Mons appear cloud free while Arsia Mons sports a wispy white orographic feature to the south east.\r\n\r\nSolis Lacus or 'the Eye of Mars' approaches eastern limb in the south, Mare Sirenum stretches from the meridian towards the F limb. Remnant of South Polar Cap shows its central crack and a number of dark spots associated with southern craters can be distinguished, including Lowell Crater near Solis Lacus.",
