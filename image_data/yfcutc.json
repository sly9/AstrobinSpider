    "description": "The nickname given to this nebula is The Phantom of the Opera, although I have to admit that for me it does not have a defined shape, although this is normal with this type of object since our brain interprets the images differently in each case.\r\nWhat I like the most about this image is the large field of stars that can be observed, as Dave Bowman would say \"my God is full of stars\", without a doubt a gift for the eyes.",
