    "description": "Two glowing gas clouds NGC 2014 and NGC 2020 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, in the southern constellation of Dorado (The Swordfish). NGC 2014 is irregularly shaped and red, while its neighbour, NGC 2020, is round and blue. These odd and very different gas clouds were both sculpted by powerful stellar winds from extremely hot newborn stars that also radiate into the gas, causing it to glow brightly (extracted from ESO).",
