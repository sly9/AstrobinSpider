    "description": "Worked on the first WinJUPOS derotation set from Saturday morning paying particular attention to colour balance. Yet to arrive at an optimal workflow for a drizzle version in order to have a balanced side-by-side comparison. Levels and relative colour saturation are always a challenge.\r\n\r\nIndividual stacks here consist of 800 frames from consecutive 90 second AVIs. Seeing peaked shortly after 6am local time but was short lasting. Sunday morning was clouded over, may have a look at the GRS region few hours from now weather permitting.",
