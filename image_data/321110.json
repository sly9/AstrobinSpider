    "description": "weather forcasts and satellites had no good news for germany with several storm warnings this friday (11/10/17). I was really suprised to see some clear skies, so i decided to check my collimation infield. Was even more suprised as the weather conditions appeared to be stable for a while...so....no risk no fun ;)\r\n\r\nIt was stormy as hell, so i had to go with 30s subs here\r\n\r\n140*30 L\r\n40*30 R\r\n40*30 G\r\n40*30 B",
