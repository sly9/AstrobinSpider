    "description": "I made an extended series of runs on Jupiter, hoping to see how the large ring that entered the RSH from the SEB may have disrupted the GRS. The seeing was poor with Jupiter at a relatively low angle, when the GRS was central. However, as the planet climbed the seeing became dramatically better. \r\nThis view with the GRS near the limb shows that the SEB ring has caused a disruption and red material has flaked off around it and has spread into its complex wake.\r\nThe image Version B, as a mouseover, is from an earlier run and shows the GRS more centrally placed although the definition of the event is not as clear.\r\nVersion C is a Methane Band image and the subtle flaking can be readily seen. I acquired this with my new ASI 462MC camera which is hugely more sensitive in IR. That and its much smaller pixels compared to my 174MM means I am able to get much higher resolution in Methane Band as hopefully you can see here.",
