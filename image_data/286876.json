    "description": "Mutant goldfish, or head of a Cardinal? This was my last image from the Winter Star Party this year. It is NGC2467, also known as the Skull and Crossbones Nebula. It certainly does not look like a skull or crossbones to me, but maybe in an eyepiece. It's very southerly, and not often photographed. It is small, this is cropped way down from the original, which was pretty wide field on a Sky-Watcher USA Esprit 150 refractor and an Finger Lakes Instrumentation FLI Proline 16803 camera. Needs more focal length and/or smaller pixels I think to do it justice. There was quite a bit more blue than I see in most other images of this on-line, and I had a struggle to keep the Ha (red) from overpowering it, and I've reprocessed this from scratch about 3 times now. Time to give up. I wish now I'd shot some OIII too. Next year I'll spend more time on this fellow.",
