    "description": "I had to try to capture this image four times, in four different nights. This is the result I liked best, and happend on the third night. It was o big challenge to align the tree with Orion with a 85mm lens. \r\n\r\nBinocular, green lasers, (south) polar align itself, and only a breif moment to do it. Only few meters already made a difference in aligning the composition.\r\n\r\nThe final image is a vertical panorama. All four images taken in immediate sequence.\r\n\r\nHope you like it! :)\r\n\r\nAPOD: https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190930.html",
