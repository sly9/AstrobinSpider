    "description": "This is a composite of 10 images ranging in exposure time from 1/4000s to 1s at ISO-200, f/5.6. \r\n Combining exposures like this lets you see the different brightness levels of the corona that your eyes can see, but the camera is less good at picking up. Super cool!\r\n\r\nThe dot of light over on the right-hand side is the star Mebsuta, which is in the leg of one of the Gemini twins. It's an eruptive variable star that is 900 lightyears away, and is 7600 times brighter, 150 times wider, and 7-9 times the mass of our sun. It also has a dimmer companion star that wasn't formed with Mebsuta, but is just passing through the vicinity.",
