    "description": "There is a nice collection of objects in this region of the constellation Cepheus. On the lower left of this image is The Cave Nebula (Sh2-155, Caldwell 9) with a bright rim of glowing gases ionized by the hot blue-white stars in the vicinity. The crescent-shaped cave structure is 10 light years across and a fan of atomic oxygen stretches out from the ridge, perforated by channels and Bok globules. At the left center of the image is a blue reflection nebula, vdB 155, and the diffuse red object in the upper right is the emission nebula, Sh2-154. Finally, the kingdom is graced by a beautiful golden, pear-shaped open star cluster in the right center cataloged at NGC7419.\r\n\r\nThe data for this image were collected in a week-long stretch of clear night skies in October. The data quality was excellent and the light subs used in this image had HFR ranging from 1.5-1.9. The processing approach was an SHO build with Hubble standard color assignments, an Ha luminance mask, and RGB star color.",
