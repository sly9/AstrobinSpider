    "description": "\r\nTesting the new ASI 290 kindly borrowed by Israel from Tellescopio.com I got this image that surprised me pleasantly.\r\nI still do not have a definite opinion because it requires more tests to speak with property but some considerations can be made.\r\nDue to the smaller pixel (2.9 microns) output we have a larger image without needing to appeal to high magnification barlows. Another thing that seems to prove the theory that smaller pixel has higher resolution are the fine details captured in both the rings and the hexagon.\r\nBesides, it is quite similar to 224, but in planetary astrophotography, any small gain that is must be much celebrated.\r\n\r\nI'm posting the image again because I accidentally deleted the original!",
