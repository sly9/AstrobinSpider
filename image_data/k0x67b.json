    "description": "Lynds Dark Nebula 1251 Stars are forming in Lynds Dark Nebula (LDN) 1251. About 1,000 light-years away, the dusty molecular cloud is part of a complex of dark nebulae mapped toward the Cepheus flare region, drifting above the plane of our Milky Way galaxy. Across the spectrum, astronomical explorations of the obscuring interstellar clouds reveal energetic shocks and outflows associated with newborn stars, including the telltale reddish glow from scattered Herbig-Haro objects seen in this sharp image. Distant background galaxies (UGC12160 and LEDA166755) also lurk on the scene, visually buried behind the dusty expanse. Also LDN1247 is partially captured on the right side of this image.",
