    "description": "A fascinating region full of textural intracacies . . . I love the Fox Fur.\r\n\r\nUnfortunatley I lost some height to the frame after an SGP upgrade changed the 'synch' default and I neglected to re-set the function back to 'synch' and my frames lost a small amount of alignment after a meridian flip on my last night of capture; resulted in a larger crop on the bottom edge.  I'll process the Ha and post up another time, my eyes are fading now after a few hours of processing.\r\n\r\nI've taken 600s subs for the RGB frames and I've been pleased with the star saturation to their cores without any processing boost - a lesson learned there.  I think the image scale also helps as I have taken this at the scope's native FL for better resolution and framing.\r\n\r\nC&Cs always welcome.  CS! & thanks for looking.",
