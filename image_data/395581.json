    "description": "This wonderful barred spiral galaxy presents a fantastic face on orientation.  It was originally thought to be a member of the Dorada Group, but its membership has been rescinded.  Scanning across NGC 1672 it is possible to identify many starburst regions with red/pink hues.  Incredible dust lanes extend away from the nucleus following the inner edges of spiral arms.  Many clusters of hot young blue stars can be identified along the arms as well. \r\n\r\nThis galaxy is definitely an individual with its flamboyant broad arms and pale blue colouring.  As you look towards the core, many dark lines and features are visible.  It’s amazing that even a modest instrument of 250mm can resolve structures within a galaxy some 60 million years distant.  It has an apparent size of 6.6 X 5.5 arcmin, and a brightness of magnitude 10.3.  \r\nNGC 1672 is also classified as a Seyfert galaxy.  They are a subset of galaxies with active nuclei.  Accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes creates incredible energy outputs and can outshine their host galaxies at times.   \r\n\r\nThis image was created using Lum, Red, Green, Blue, and Ha filters.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstruments:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\n37 X 900 Bin 1X1 Lum\r\n16 X 450 Bin 2X2 Red\r\n16 X 450 Bin 2X2 Green\r\n16 X 450 Bin 2X2 Blue\r\n12 X 900 Bin 1X1 Ha\r\n\r\nTotal time: 18.25 hours\r\n\r\nLocation\r\nAustralia, Central Victoria",
