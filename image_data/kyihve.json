    "description": "Imaged on nights of 8/6/2020, 8/7/2020, 8/8/2020, 8/1`3/2020.\r\n\r\nA faint planetary nebula located in Cassiopeia.  It is 5000 light years from us with an actual diameter of 4 light years, and  fairly small at 2.7 arc-minutes.  This PN is very rarely imaged and there is almost no information turned up in my search.\r\nIt is, however, rather colorful, having good contributions of both Ha and Oiii, with a two sided Ha ring surrounding an Oiii central portion.  A faint blue central star is presumably energizing this PN.\r\n\r\nAlso known as PK 112-10.1,PN G112.9-10.2,IRAS 23452+5107, PN G112.9-10.2,IRAS 23452+5107.",
