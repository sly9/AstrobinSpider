    "description": "This object is a part of the Vela supernova remnant, located 800 light years away in the southern constellation of Vela.  It is estimated that the supernova exploded approximately 12,000 years ago.  The Vela supernova remnant overlaps the Gum supernova remnant, and the two are among the largest and brightest features in the X-ray sky.  The Vela SNR is one of the closest supernova remnants to earth. \r\n\r\nThe region captured in this image is the brightest section of the Vela SNR, aside from the Pencil Nebula which is also imaged on this site.  The bright star in the image is the magnitude 4 star e Velorum.   This part of the SNR is known as The Bridge, because the bright emission arc of the SNR looks to some like a highway in the broader view, and this small part of it has some perpendicular elements which look like a bridge for the highway.\r\n\r\nThis object is low in the southern sky from my location and I had to wait for a night with good seeing in order to obtain a reasonable image.",
