    "description": "This is one of my favorite targets and I've never had a chance to do it justice until now. Tried to bring out the cocoon of dust and gas around the \"pillars of creation\" that form the namesake Eagle in this Nebula and rotated to imply a sense of movement across the frame.\r\n\r\nImage itself is in the SHO palette and also have a version that includes RGB stars. I think I prefer the starless since the details are more apparent, especially the faint green that highlights the lower right of the image. I may try an all RGB version or HaRGB version next!",
