    "description": "NGC 7380 - Wizard Nebula\r\nCamera: Atik 314L+\r\nScope: Orion EON 80ED\r\nFilters: Astrodon 3nm Ha, OIII, SII\r\nExposure data: Ha: 20 x 1500s, 9 x 1200s (total: 11 hrs, 20 min), OIII: 12 x 1200s (3 hrs), SII: 12 x 1200s (3 hrs).\r\nTotal exposure time: 16 hrs 20 min\r\n\r\nFinal image I took from the Staunton River Star Party 2016, although this is a combination of data from 3 different star parties over the years. I had only ever taken Ha on this and finally shot the rest of the narrowband palette this trip.\r\nNotes: I decided to add some star spikes on the final image just 'cause I was in the mood for them today :) I also cropped it a little more than the original Ha just to highlight the main portion of the nebula. This was started in 2011/2012, more data taken in 2014, and finally finished up this year ... that's what I get for forgetting what images I start and need to get more data on.",
