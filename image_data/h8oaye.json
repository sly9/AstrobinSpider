    "description": "Hi ! Thanks for watching !\r\n\r\nFinal revision  is a crop on M8 at native resolution , original revision is full sensor. I prefer the close-up view :-)\r\n\r\nI found M8 really challenging to process. \r\n\r\nFirst challenge was M8 brightness/contrast : the core is so bright that if you do not use HDR functions, you can not get both the nebula and the background context with a good exposition. I had never use HDR and it was a hard learning curve.  Not sure I found the right spot on this M8.\r\n\r\nSecond challenge was color : I wanted to keep good stars and nebula colors. I looked at a lot of RGB M8 and did not really manage to find a reference color here on Astrobin. Found the Adam Block's version beautiful and useful to check stars and nebs colors. Mine a bit more blueish.\r\n\r\nThird challenge was \"No starless\", I tried and found it difficult to go starless processing in RGB. Also I did not manage to achieve a good  result using Ha as Lum so I finally created a synthetic Lum with RGB. This was used as luminance in the image. A starless Ha was used to increase core details (high pass).\r\n\r\nI really struggled to achieve this final version (Revision BD!) and still not sure about it...\r\n\r\nThanks for reading !",
