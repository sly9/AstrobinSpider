    "description": "My last attempt on the Horsehead Nebula was one year ago - with my astro-modified Nikon D500 on the SkyWatcher Star Adventurer. Still remember that night at Fort Griffin Historical Site, with so much trouble trying to aim the Nikkor 70-200mm lens, could only track for 60 seconds, cranking up all the way up to ISO 5000. Finally only saw the faint horsehead showing up on the view finder - Pure Joy at that moment. \r\n\r\nHere comes the revisit. The H-Alpha data was collected at home and RGB data was from TAS Atoka site this Monday. It was freezing cold (-4C). \r\n\r\nSomehow I still feel something is missing. I haven't figure it out yet. The resolving power of the GT-81 is not enough to bring up the most important details. I tried to order an Astrodon Sloan i' filter for this target for the infrared data. The order never delivered. It will happen later, I hope. \r\n \r\n \r\n<B>Pre-processing of Ha Master</B>\r\n\r\n<I>- Calibration / Integration, Astro Pixel Processor\r\n- Dynamic Background Extraction, PixInsight\r\n- Deconvolution, PixInsight\r\n- MultiscaleLinearTransformation (Denoise), PixInsight\r\n- ScreenTransferFunction / HistogramTransformation, PixInsight.</I>\r\n\r\n<B>Pre-processing of RGB Masters</B>\r\n\r\n<I>- Calibration / Integration, Astro Pixel Processor\r\n- Dynamic Background Extraction, PixInsight\r\n- MultiscaleLinearTransformation (Denoise), PixInsight\r\n- MorphologicalTransformation, PixInsight\r\n- ScreenTransferFunction / HistogramTransformation, PixInsight.</I>\r\n\r\n<B>HaRGB Combination & Post-processing</B>\r\n\r\n<I>- LRGBCombination (Ha master as the Lum), PixInsight\r\n- Final Touch-up, Photoshop</I>",
