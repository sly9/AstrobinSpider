    "description": "A super rich region within the LMC with tons of HA, along with a very unique bias towards young blue stars. When first processing this data I thought it sure must have been an artifacts, but it turns out this area doesn't have a yellow, white, and red bias like most regions (even though we also may not process them as such), it truly does just have countless blue stars within it. A strange area indeed, but a fascinating one regardless that is rarely imaged. Additionally, the above image is a 2x1 mosaic, capturing even more of these rarely imaged nebulae. My favorite part of the image though is the top right. The elliptical globular cluster. Thought this was an artifact from mosaic stitching, but nope, apparently these are rather common in the LMC as well.",
