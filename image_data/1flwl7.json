Discovered by Marcel Drechsler and Xavier Strottner in early 2020, the candidate has a diameter approximately the size of the full moon (if the outer parts of the structure are included) and is located at a distance of 1085 or 4740 light years from Earth - depending on which of the two possible central stars is used to calculate the distance.\r\n\r\nWhether this object is a real planetary nebula is not yet clear at the moment. A spectrum will hopefully soon bring certainty.\r\nThe potential central white dwarf is located east of the central H-alpha structure, but in the middle of a diffuse OIII cloud.\r\nThe OIII signal is extremely faint, but could be detected by continuum subtraction.\r\nThe central star is a hot subdwarf of class D sdB. It is known that this class of stars is not suitable for PN formation. \r\nHowever, there are indications that the classification of the star is not correct.\r\n\r\nAt the coordinates 04 06 7.440 +42 34 48.60 there is another white dwarf with a temperature of 27000 Kelvin, which could also be responsible for ionization.  The star's position is at the periphery of the candidate and its speed is high enough to be a central star. It is possible that the white dwarf was once part of a binary system, this could explain the appearance of the nebula.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting detail a possible ring-shaped structure, which appears as a southern arc around the nebula.\r\nRings of this kind are not uncommon around planetary nebulae.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite dwarf 1\r\n- KPD 0402+4232 (Hot subdwarf)\r\n- spectral class: sdB D\r\n- temperature: 9183.25K (These data seem doubtful)\r\n- magnitude: 15.4453\r\n- parallax: 0.8100\r\n- distance: 1453 parsecs\r\n- proper motion: RA -5,123 / -1,212\r\n\r\nWhite dwarf 2\r\n- WDJ040607.42+423448.67\r\n- Pwd: 99,9\r\n- temperature: 27222 Kelvin\r\n- pm: RA 23.297 / DEC -17.021\r\n- mass (sun): 0,62%\r\n- magnitude: 18.229490\r\n- parallax: 2.9852\r\n- distance: 333 Pc\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nExposure \r\nRGB each 36x5min\r\nHa 3nm 94x15min\r\nSII 3nm 20x15min\r\nHa 7nm 114x10min\r\nOIII 3nm 94x15min\r\nTotal exposure 80 hours\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n3x Takahashi Epsilon 130D, \r\n3x Atik one 9.0, \r\nAstrodon RGB filter, Astrodon 3nm narrowband. \r\nMounting: EQ8",
