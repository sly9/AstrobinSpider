    "description": "IC4628 - The Prawn nebula. Located in Scorpius about 6000 light years away, this is an emission nebula which glows because of young nearby hot suns which  irradiate the nebula with ultraviolet light. This strips electrons from atoms which recombine to produce a visible red glow due to the dominance of hydrogen. This image has been processed using the hubble palette to reveal the emission of hydrogen in more detail and to provide a more aesthetically pleasing image.",
