    "description": "First documented by our Chinese ancestors in 1054, when a giant star exploded creating what is known today as M1 - The Crab Nebula. The Crab Nebula is so named because, as seen through a telescope with the human eye, it appears vaguely like a crab.\r\n\r\nCharles Messier initially thought this to be Halleyâ€™s Comet and was cought by surprise by the discovery that it wasn't true. This inspired him to create a catalog of celestial objects that might be mistaken for comets and thus the first in his catalog, \"Messier 1\". The Crab nebula is home to a pulsar , a highly dense, rapidly rotating star, roughly 20 kilometers in diameter. The pulsar \"beams\" rotate once every 33 milliseconds, or 30 times each second and is one of the highest generators of most emission from a nebula throwing everything from radio waves through to gamma rays.",
