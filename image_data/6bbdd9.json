    "description": "Located 78 million light years from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius the infrequently imaged NGC 7727 (also known as ARP 222 classed as a peculiar galaxy) is likely the result of a collision and merger of two spiral galaxies. Of the two bright point objects seen in the center, one is likely to be the core of one of the merged galaxies.\r\nNGC 7727 has very little in the way of new star formation and is likely to transform into an Elliptical Galaxy in the future.\r\nImaged  in LRGB at Obstech, Chile\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\r\nSystem Control Software: Voyager by Leo Orazi",
