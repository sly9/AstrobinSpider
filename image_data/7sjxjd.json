    "description": "Edge formations in motion. Supplement to the recently posted photo.\r\n\r\nFor the vast Bailly crater it's not that exciting, but for the Hausen, Le Gentil, and Drygalski craters behind it, it's practically a visual \"to be or not to be\". They are so rarely visible that it is impossible to miss this lunation moment.\r\n\r\nThe weather conditions were good, the phase and the lighting associated with it as well, the progressive southwestern libration set the southern edge of the Silver Globe as if for a parade - with panache.\r\n\r\nThe accelerated movement of the edge formations shows the swaying of the Silver Globe in an unusual way. The impression of spatial structure of the structures is enhanced - the height becomes more important. Apart from the above-mentioned phenomena, I am impressed by the change in the shape of the very edge of the Moon - the appearance of hills and valleys, their shifting along a narrow coastal strip - revealing an additional geometric context that changes a flat image into a three-dimensional panorama of the coastline.\r\n\r\nSeptember 14 (W -6.8°; S -4.3°); 3d 8h to new moon\r\nSeptember 13 (W -7.2°; S -3°); 4d 9h to new moon\r\nSeptember 12 (W -7.1°; S -1.6°); 5d 10h to new moon",
