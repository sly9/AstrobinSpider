    "description": "Sh2- at Pi Scorpio and Sh2-7 at Delta Scorpio:\r\nI have worked on this a few times over the years and finally have something somewhat satisfying. \r\n\r\nThis image is an unusual combination of filters using subs of (6)Halpha at 1200\",(4)Hbeta at 900\", (4) Yellow at 360\", and (4)Red at 360\". I used Hbeta as the blue channel, generated the green channel with pixel math using yellow and red, and the red channel as Halpha. Then combined the Halpha and Hbeta as a luminance channel. This tends to highlight the Halpha and sort of represents the stars.\r\n\r\nSh2-1: Also known as Sharpless 1, is listed as a reflection nebula in the constellation of Scorpius, however it contains a significant amount of hyhrogen and images well with both Hbeta and Halpha each showing different nebula. The B-type star Pi Scorpio is in the center of the nebula.\r\n\r\nSh2-7:I a large and very faint nebula around the star Delta Scorpii a B-type star. There is some reflection nebula around the star.\r\n\r\nNorth is to the left...",
