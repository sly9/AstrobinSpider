    "description": "41 hours of integration time acquire from the 16 RCOS at Sierra Remote Observatory. The small spiral galaxy NGC2276 has a very high rate of star formation, with six supernovae in the last sixty years. Not much info about the other lenticular galaxy. There is also a nice bit of IFN all around. \n\nIf you want to learn some image processing, please check out my website https://astrofalls.com/, I am offering image processing lessons! \n\nHope you all enjoy!",
