    "description": "Another beauty of the Southern Sky  NGC1097 : 2 jets can clearly be seen and the last 2 jets are almost invible between the galaxy and the bright star to the right side.\r\n\r\nNGC 1097 is a barred spiral galaxy about 45 million light years away in the constellation Fornax. It was discovered by William Herschel on 9 October 1790. It is a severely interacting galaxy with obvious tidal debris and distortions caused by interaction with the companion galaxy NGC 1097A.\r\n\r\nNGC 1097 is also a Seyfert galaxy with 4 optical jets coming from the nucleus.\r\n\r\nRed 12 subs@120s -20°C bin 2 gain high\r\nBlue 12 subs@120s -20°C bin 2 gain high\r\nGreen 12 subs@120s -20°C bin 2 gain high\r\nLight 57subs@300s -20°C, gain high\r\nHalpha 8subs@300s -20°C, gain high",
