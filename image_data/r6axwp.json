    "description": "LBN 603 is a very faint dust cloud in the constellation Cassiopeia. \r\n\r\nThe object includes LDN 1296 and LDN 1295.\r\n\r\nIt's fun exploring the Lynds' Bright Nebulae catalog to find these obscure lurkers that don't get too much attention. This dusty object is obscured by a brilliant very dense star field, and the moon made the imaging challenging. \r\n\r\nI've elected to significantly reduce and desaturate most of the stars to bring the nebula forward in the image and reveal its wispy tendrils.",
