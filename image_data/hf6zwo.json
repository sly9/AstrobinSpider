    "description": "James Dunlop discovered this beautiful galaxy in 1828.  It is a Barred Spiral Galaxy located in the constellation Fornax, The Furnace.  NGC 986 presents itself almost face on,  highlighting two large (slightly warped ) extended arms that start at either end of the bar.   An interesting grouping of stars forming a line pointing outwards adds a bit of uniqueness to the galaxy.  It almost looks as if the galaxy is shooting stuff out into the cosmos, or a funky antenna.  \r\n\r\nStar-forming areas filled with young blue stars are spread along the prominent arms.  The resulting blues are always a nice treat in galaxy shots.  NGC 986 presents a fairly small target with an apparent size of 4.17 X 3.02 arcmin and distant at 56 million light-years away.  Given that, it’s still fairly bright at 11th-magnitude.   \r\n\r\nFornax is one of my favourite areas with so many galaxies.  The very rich Fornax Cluster of galaxies tends to be a favourite with many imagers.  I wasn’t sure how to present this attractive galaxy, small within a sea of stars, or cropped to focus on the galaxy itself.  In the end, I went with about a one-third crop of my field of view to retain a bit of perspective, showing the galaxy against a sea of stars.\r\n\r\nInstruments:\r\n10 Inch fl 9.1 RCOS\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\nRed 18 X 600 Bin 1X1\r\nGreen 18 X 600 Bin 1X1\r\nBlue 18 X 600 Bin 1X1\r\nLum 47 X 900 Bin 1X1   \r\n\r\nTotal Time:  20.75 Hours",
