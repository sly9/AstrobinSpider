    "description": "NGC 6188 is an emission nebula in the constellation of Ara at a distance of approximately 4,000 light years. This image also includes the bright open cluster NGC 6193, the light from which is stimulating additional reflection nebulosity.  The name Fighting Dragons comes from the shapes within the image that look like a pair of fighting dragons.  If you let your imagination run on,  you can see a fighting dragon, a dog trying to fend off the dragon and a cat trying to run away from the excitement. There is also a large bat hanging upside from the upper left hand corner watching all of the action from above.\r\n\r\nThis image is comprised of Ha, OIII and SII and has been assembled using the Hubble palette SHO technique and processing in Pixinsight.",
