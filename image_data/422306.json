    "description": "The Draco Group (or Triplet) consists of the face-on spiral NGC 5985 (leftmost of the group in this image), the elliptical galaxy NGC 5982 (central) and the edge-on spiral NGC 5981 (right).  According to the Webb Deep-Sky Society website, the approximate distances to these galaxies are as follows: NGC 5985 - 120 million light years; NGC 5982 - 130 million years; and NGC 5981 - 100 million light years. \r\n\r\nData for this image were collected on 31 March 2019 from a dual TEC 140 rig located at Les Granges, Olly Penrice's facility in the Haut Alpes, France.  \r\n\r\nThe image has been cropped to around 50% of the full-frame in order to focus on the triplet.\r\n\r\nCapture Details:\r\n\r\nTelescopes: TEC 140 x 2\r\nMount: Mesu 200\r\nCameras: Atik 460 (Lum); Moravian G2-8300 (RGB)\r\n\r\nLum: 20 x 900s\r\nRed: 12 x 600s\r\nGreen: 12 x 600s\r\nBlue: 12 x 600s\r\n\r\nTotal integration time: 11 hours\r\n\r\nData: Olly Penrice; Tom O'Donoghue; Elisabeth Milne; Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Elisabeth Milne",
