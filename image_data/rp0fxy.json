    "description": "Along the edge of a large molecular cloud in the constellation Cepheus, and nearby to the Veil nebula sits a large amount of galactic dust... the portion in the middle which makes up the reflection nebula often referred to as the Ghost Nebula. This concentration of dust is lit up by bright stars nearby, of which a few are sitting right in the middle of it causing interesting light cones to emerge through from our vantage point. There are two formations on the inner most dust cloud that many say look like cats, and others say tormented souls... either case I most enjoy the apparent rays of dust coming down on them from the bat-signal shaped region at the top of the frame, and the faint whisp of a spirit flying overhead. My favorite formation however is the lighter white whisp on the left side of the field above the bright white star in that area.\r\n\r\nEquipment:\r\n* 8in f4.9 Newtonian Reflector w/ Sesto Senso Auto Focuser\r\n* Skywatcher Quattro Coma Corrector\r\n* ZWO EFW and Astrodon LRGB Filters (First image taken and processed using LRGB filters!)\r\n* ZWO ASI 183mm Pro - Cooled to -15.0C\r\n* Celestron CGEM Mount\r\n* Dew Strips around the Primary mirror\r\n\r\nIntegration/Acquisition Time per Channel:\r\n* L: 248/269 x 120s (8.2hrs)\r\n* R:  82/ 86 x 120s (2.7hrs)\r\n* G:  86/ 88 x 120s (2.9hrs)\r\n* B:  87/ 89 x 120s (2.9hrs)\r\n\r\nTotal acquisition time: 17 hours 44 minutes\r\nTotal rejected frames:  00 hours 58 minutes\r\nTotal integration time: 16 hours 46 minutes\r\nData Taken across 3 nights: Aug 28th-Aug30th\r\nGuiding averaged ~0.8\"/px RMS across all nights; Image Scale: 0.5\"/px\r\n\r\nFlats: 20/filter Calibrated Dark Flats;\r\nDarks: 60/120s @ -15.0C\r\nBias: None\r\n\r\nEach color channel was stacked by\r\n* Integrating all images with\r\n    * Linear Fit Clipping\r\n    * Default rejection settings\r\n* Drizzle Integration with\r\n    * Scale: 1x\r\n    * Drop Shrink: 0.9\r\n    * Kernel Function Var k=1.5\r\n\r\nA superluminance was created by\r\n* Integrating all images with \r\n    * Linear Fit Clipping\r\n    * Sigma High=10\r\n    * Sigma Low=10 \r\n* Drizzle Integration with \r\n    * Scale: 1x\r\n    * Drop shrink: 0.7 \r\n    * Kernel Function: Var k=1.5\r\n\r\nLuminance Processing (with Super Luminance):\r\n* Crop edges\r\n* One gentle pass of DBE with a low Shadow Relaxation (A very dusty region causes for challenging gradient removal...
