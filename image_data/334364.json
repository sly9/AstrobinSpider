    "description": "Unfortunately my image of this little planetary nebula was one of the casualties of the recent data loss, so here it is again.\r\n\r\nThis is NGC 2242, to be found in the constellation of Auriga, 6500 light years away  and 1600 light years above the galactic plane. Until 1987 it was classified as a galaxy but its infrared emissions and lack of redshift got it reclassified as a planetary nebula.",
