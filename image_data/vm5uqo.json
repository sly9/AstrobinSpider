    "description": "After months of cloud & rain on the West Coast, I figured I may as well try my hand at processing Hubble image data. Full credit to Doug's Hubble processing tutorial:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.remote-astrophotography.com/ProcessHubbleImage/ProcessHubbleImage.html\r\n\r\nI used the same FITS files, but took the processing a bit further to see if I could balance the colours differently, reduce the noise and pull out more detail. I might have gone a bit too far on the noise reduction & sharpening, but it's a start!",
