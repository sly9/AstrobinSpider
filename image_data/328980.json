    "description": "Combination of data from RC Optical, RH-305 and AG Optical iDK.  This is what happens when you combine all that data.  Interesting.  The outer fringe has lots of faint noise that I at first thought was noise that I obliterated in earlier versions.  All frames registered to RC Optical data (0.55\" / pixel).  \r\n\r\nResults, especially luminance, were essentially noise free and did not require much if any NR.",
