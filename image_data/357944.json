    "description": "The Elephantâ€™s Trunk nebula (van den Bergh 142) is part the emission nebula IC 1396.  It is approximately 3,000 light years from Earth in the constellation of Cepheus.  IC 1396 is ionized by a massive, blue star - HD 206267 that would be slightly above the field of view shown in this image (East).  The trunk is a site of star formation, containing several stars that may be as young as 100,000 years.\r\n\r\nThis is narrowband data captured between 11 and 18 November 2017 from a remote imaging rig located in Spain jointly owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me. \r\nI have presented this previously, but always felt that the first version was a little anaemic.  This is a significant rework from scratch.  \r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nCamera: QSI 683 WSG\r\nFilters: Astrodon 5nm\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nSII: 20 x 1200s\r\nHa: 21 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 21 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 20.7 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData Capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
