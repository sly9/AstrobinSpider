    "description": "This image was an APOD on 05/05/2020;\r\n\r\nIn order to capture this precise alignment between tree and Eta Carinae Nebula I had to try it through three nights in a roll. Two of those nights without any success.\r\n\r\nThis capture was a big challenge for me. I've used a 85mm lens, so the polar alignment asked for sharpness (to do it in a middle of a field is not a easy task). Furthermore my plan was to do a panoramic of four. Two horizontal and two vertical. Any gaps between them would make me lose the final -integrated- picture.\r\n\r\nFor the fist night I was in the wrong spot. The nebula was way to the left. The second night, clouds formed exactly in that west position, making the nebula quickly disappear.\r\n\"Third time is a charm\", right? Barely. Seeing the image it´s possible to glimpse clouds forming in southwest, and suddenly after the shots they flooded the skyes. I was lucky. If I had waited more 60 seconds to start capturing all would have been lost.\r\n\r\nThis image was taken during the 2019 Brazilian Astrophotography Meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ Tech Specs ]\r\n\r\n85mm Lens | Canon 6D (Ha mod) | ISO 3200 | f4 | Portable Equatorial Mount | Exposure Time: 70\" seconds | Six images taken in immediate sequence, forming a vertical panorama; Two for the ground and four for the sky | Final image has been croped 70% from original frame.",
