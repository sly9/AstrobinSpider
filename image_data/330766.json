    "description": "Centaurus A is a beautiful galaxy of the southern hemisphere. On the island of La Palma it rises up to around 18°, very early in the morning in January. With a 10x50 bino it is quite good visible, I think I also saw the dustband a bit, but that could be also imagination. :)\r\n\r\nI gathered 26 subs, each 360 seconds. Shot with my Canon 600Da through a Pentax SDP 105 which I borrowed from ATHOS Centro Astronómico. It is of course not the best picture ever and lacks exposure time, but  I was happy to catch it. Now I am back in Switzerland where I will not see it at all. Who knows when I will get the chance to shoot southern objects again... :)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJan",
