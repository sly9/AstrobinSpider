    "description": "The Hand in the Desert (Mano del Desierto) was created in the early 1980’s by a Chilean Sculpture named Mario Irarrázabal. It is made out of iron and cement and sits in the middle of nowhere, the Atacama Desert (in Chile)  which is the driest desert in the world. The sculpture was created to signify the horrifying human rights issues that the Chileans have dealt with in the past. You can really see that by the hand coming out of the sand.",
