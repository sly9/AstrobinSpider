    "description": "Resembling a rugged ocean coastline, Cygnus Wall is a ridge of dust and glowing gases is more than 20 million light-years long. Where the ocean coast has been carved by the erosion of wind and water, this ridge is shaped by the energetic radiation of nearby stars.\r\n\r\nThis image of Cygnus Wall hangs in Gallery Sur, Carmel (www.gallerysur.com), and paragraph above is the wall tag that describes it. My goal in developing this image was to emphasize the range of light and to reveal the fine structure of the gas and dust that is often hidden in the inky darkness of the surrounding space. I also wanted to create a less dark and moody image that had more transparent color akin to a watercolor. I have found that this image (and others that I have created using the same approach) are best displayed when printed on a medium textured watercolor paper mounted on a floater frame to reveal the edge of the paper. This image is my most popular at Gallery Sur. Even people that are not fans of astrophotography find it compelling and display it in their homes.\r\n\r\nThis image is a contribution to the Fine-Art Astrophotography group. I  suspect that for some of the Astrobin audience, this approach to astrophotography is not appealing. For a more traditional approach to this object I invite you to see my earlier post of Cygnus Wall in NB Natural, https://www.astrobin.com/416258/?nc=user",
