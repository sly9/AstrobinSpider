    "description": "This delicate looking galaxy is located in the Sculptor constellation.  It is a very large barred spiral, almost 3 times larger than our own Milky Way.  The very faint bluish spiral arms are estimated to be 300,000 light-years across.  \r\n\r\nI performed a slight crop on the image as I wanted to retain the feeling of distance from this beautiful galaxy some +70 million light-years away.  At this distance, NGC 289 presents the angular dimensions of 5.10 X 3.6 arcmins, a visual magnitude of 11, with a surface brightness of 14.0 mag/arcmin2.  This certainly adds to the challenge as the galaxy core small, and its arms are incredibly dim requiring long exposures to reveal them against the background.  I really wanted to capture the faint arms and thought I would try 20 min exposures as an experiment in the Luminance channel.   I don’t have a data set of 15 min exposures, so I can’t really tell if there is or would be a difference in the end result.   \r\n\r\nInstruments:\r\n10 Inch fl 9.1 RCOS\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\nLum 41 X 1200          \t\r\nRed  21 X 500            \r\nGreen 11 X 500          \r\nBlue 26 X 500            \r\nHa 21 X 1800     \r\n       \r\nTotal Exposure:        32.21",
