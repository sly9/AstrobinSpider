    "description": "With the core nebula spanning just over a light year, Messier 27 is a stellar remnant that lies toward the constellation of Vulpecula.   Research indicates that the central star collapsed into a white dwarf about 15,000 years ago.   In its metamorphosis, the outer atmosphere was shed into space.   \r\n\r\nDeep exposure reveals how these complex layers of hydrogen and oxygen intertwine and spread through the local neighborhood.   \r\n\r\nStar stuff ...the building blocks of you and everything you know!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!!",
