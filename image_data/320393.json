    "description": "LDN1235 Shark Nebula 5.7hr LRGB\r\nA molecular cloud (LBN535) in Cepheus includes LDN1235, the eye of the shark, and two reflection nebula, VdB 150 (upper) and 149 (lower).  The Shark Nebula complex is composed of interstellar gas and dust illuminated by UV radiation.  It spans about 15 ly and is 650 ly away.  “Gravitationally recondensing massive stars may carve intricate [temporary] structures into their birth cloud using their high energy light and fast stellar winds as sculpting tools… Humans enjoy imagining these great clouds as common icons, like we do for water clouds on Earth.” (APOD 2015 Sept 7 write-up).\r\nTaken at D.A.R.C. Obs., Mercey Hot Springs, CA, 10/21/17.",
