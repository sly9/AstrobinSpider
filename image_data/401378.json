Dark nebulae are non-luminous cloudy objects formed by diffuse matter in the Milky Way. Like all bright nebulae, dark nebulae vary in size and shape. Large nebulae have tens to hundreds of solar masses, some even larger, and their internal density varies widely. Some dark nebulae are dense enough to shield large numbers of stars from the background, so these regions look black.The dark nebula near IC 2087 is an example\r\n    A reflection nebula,  IC2087, is shaped like a burning flame, and is particularly noticeable in the center of a large number of dark nebula.\r\n    Why is this IC 2087 red? That's because an infrared light source is found embedded in the dark nebula of Taurus, near the reflection nebula IC 2087. \r\nThis infrared star is likely to be the source of light for IC2087.",
