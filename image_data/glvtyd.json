    "description": "I hope everyone is staying safe and well over the Easter period. For me, I've rediscovered a couple of board games with the family, and dabbled a bit with image processing.\r\n\r\nMy previous attempts to image this target in 2018 were limited to OSC data, and turned out pretty bland despite my best efforts. Taking another swing after incorporating Ha data has been more rewarding and enjoyable. It's such an majestic shape!\r\n\r\nI also captured a few hours of OIII data for a HOO palette version, but there were some nasty halos on bright stars needing attention. So that'll be a job for another time. \r\n\r\nMaybe Santa will reward me with some Astrodon filters one day ... if he can source them!",
