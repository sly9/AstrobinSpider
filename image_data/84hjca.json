    "description": "IC443, the Jellyshih Nebula is a supernova remnant in the constellation Gemini.  It is believed to be from 3000 to 30,000 years old may be associated with the nuetron star  CXOU J061705.3+222127.  As with many SNRs, the SII band is quite strong and dominates over both the Ha and OIII bands.",
