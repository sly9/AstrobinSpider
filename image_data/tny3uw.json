    "description": "This is the first image with my new telescope! I battled poor seeing and strong winds to acquire the data, and so many frames were excluded from processing. Fortunately this is a bright galaxy. I hope you will enjoy my effort.\r\n\r\nNGC4565, the so-called Needle Galaxy, is one of the most iconic edge-on spiral galaxies in the northern sky. It is located about 40 million light years away in the constellation Coma Berenices and is a favorite spring target for both imagers and visual observers. The galaxy was discovered by William Herschel in 1785; it would easily have made Charles Messier's list, but somehow he missed it during his searches.\r\n\r\nNGC4565 is likely a barred spiral and our own Milky Way galaxy may have a similar appearance if viewed from outside along the galactic plane at a similar distance. Assuming the 40 million light years distance is accurate, NGC4565 would have a diameter of about 100,000 lights years, which is similar to diameter estimates for the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThe field surrounding NGC4565 contains many faint galaxies; the brightest, which appears at the top of my image, is NGC4562. There is a very faint cluster of galaxies located just off the right tip of NGC4565 in my image.",
