    "description": "Suddenly, several clear nights now and this is a mix of various data from last night and two weeks ago. It is a two frame mosaic with the Ha collected with my ES 5\" refractor and a Canon 60Da with Baader 7nm Ha filter (mostly 25 min subs at ISO1600). The colour is from my Canon 300mm f/4 and a Canon 60D without any filter. It has been around -12Â°C so not much noise (but a lot of stiff hurting hands).\r\n\r\nI have to admit I mainly used the Ha for Lum but I think I did a rather good job at controlling the stars, which is usually a problem, by an elaborate use of masking.\r\n\r\nStacked in PI and processed in PS.\r\nIn version H some deconcolution in PI has been selectively added\r\n\r\nThanks for looking and please comment/suggest. Maybe I should pull back a bit on the colour saturation?",
