    "description": "Fornax A is a lenticular galaxy about 60 million light-years away in the constellation Fornax. It is a radio galaxy and at 1400 MHz is the fourth-brightest radio source in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe total integration time of this image is 27.3 hours. With a fast focal ratio, some very deep structures in this ripping galaxy are revealed. For example, you can see a loop clearly on the right side of the galaxy. There are also many dwarf galaxies in this image.\r\n\r\nIt seems like nobody in astrobin captured the loop structure on the right clearly before!",
