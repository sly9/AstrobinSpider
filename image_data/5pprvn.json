    "description": "My attempt to capture a RARE \"perfect\" lunar transit of the International Space Station .... I'm  so glad I managed to capture it, but I regret to not have a most suitable equipment!\r\n\r\nImaged with my 8\" Dobson , without any GOTO or EQ platform, and Sony a7s + 2X Barlow lens\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1/21/2020\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU all for the unexpected POD nomination! Further details about this shoot: I made it @ 4:51 AM, I woke up 2hrs before and drove (oh, well... Actuallu my car drove me, I was a little asleep) for about 40' to the pre-defined location. I set up my Meade Lightbridge Dobson and my Sony a7s at prime focus (with a 2x barlow) and made a few test shoots.... 60fps FullHD video, 1/6400\" (based on my pixel size and transit duration to avoid blurred frames) and 3200 ISO.\r\n\r\nHere's the original clip:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/mBRzQMHS_9k",
