    "description": "A 5 panel mosaic taken with the Samyang 50mm Prime Lens using ZWO ASI294MC Pro. Each panel was only a 1hr exposure from the Maleny Golf Club in the hinterland of the Sunshine Coast. The skies are a beautiful Bortle 4. Had a magnificent night catching up with the crew after a pretty ordinary summer of cloudy stormy skies and following the disruptions of Covid 19! Just scored a new Samsung 28\" 4K HD monitor. Tell you what, makes a big difference to processing. Enjoy.",
