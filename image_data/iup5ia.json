    "description": "Experimenting with narrow band imaging and assigning to color palette.  Nothing scientific, just experimenting with data.  Remote imaging setups afford the ability to experiment with gear and acquisition approaches that may not be possible for you at the present time.  This experiment has led me to explore narrow band imaging with my RASA 8.  Just waiting for the monochrome camera and filter set.  Excited to begin a new portfolio on the website.  Clear skies!\r\n\r\nThis is a custom color palette.  Here is the pixel math.  \r\nR(integration_Ha * 0.8) + (integration_SII * 0.2)\r\nG(integration_Ha * 0.6) +(integration_OIII * 0.4)\r\nB(integration_OIII)",
