    "description": "The Blue Horsehead Nebula (IC 4592) is a reflection nebula in the Scorpius constellation about 400 light years away.  The fine dust reflects blue from the light of the Nu Scorpii star system near the eye of the horse.  In the upper part near the horse's ear, two stars make up reflection nebula IC 4601.  This beautiful area is in the upper part of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex.\r\n\r\nI have wanted to image this area but last year was not very productive when it's position was favorable.  I took this image over 2 nights at the end of this May while on vacation in the mountains.  There were intermittent clouds on one of the nights but I was still able to get enough time for this image.  Here is my version of the Blue Horsehead Nebula:\r\n\r\nCanon T3i ISO 1600\r\n135mm @ f4\r\n162 x 120 \r\niOptron Skytracker",
