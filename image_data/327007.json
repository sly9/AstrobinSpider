    "description": "This object is a faint dwarf elliptical galaxy located 2 million light years away in the constellation of Cassiopeia.  It is a small satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31).  The stars of the galaxy are not able to be resolved.  This galaxy, with a diameter of 12,000 light years, is about the same size as nearby NGC 185 and likely revolves around it as a binary system.  M31 and its four brightest companions (NGC 147, NGC 185, M32, and M110) are all members of the Coma-Sculptor Galaxy Cloud.",
