    "description": "I started this project in july with my 250/1000 newton and finished it with the 300/1200 . \r\nI was not satisfied with the Halpha made in july because of the noise due to high temperature during this month and the difficulty to get the peltier working below -15째C. So I redo all the Halpha subs with the new 300/1200 and a cooler period . It gave much better result !\r\n\r\n12 nights : 9/10, 10/11, 13, 14 , 16, 26, 30  July  and 1, 2/3, 7/8, 8/9 17 August\r\n\r\n70 SII Subs @180s (gain 139, -20째C)  with newton 250/1000\r\n89 OIII Subs @180s (gain 139, -20째C) with newton 250/1000\r\n102 HalphaSubs @300s (gain 139, -20째C) with newton 300/1200\r\n=> 318 subs @300s about 26.3 hours of exposure",
