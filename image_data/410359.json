    "description": "Been getting a bit chummy with operators over at the DCT. Luckily that means new friends and new data. I've been sitting on some of these sets for a while and just used them for my personal use, however, we finally got the okay to start sharing some of the results so I figured I'd post some over here! Huge thank you to my friend Andrew who was the telescope operator who captured this data set.  \r\n\r\nThese results made use of the Lowell Observatoryâ€™s Discovery Channel Telescope",
