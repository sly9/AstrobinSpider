    "description": "Interacting Galaxies NGC 3190, 3185, 3187, 3193 are part of the Hickson 44 compact group in the constellation, Leo. Astronomer Paul Hickson published a list of 100 such groups in 1982. These groups often have gravitationally interacting galaxies. While many interacting galaxies are distant, appear small and are hard to resolve with amateur telescopes, I am fascinated by them. This field of view provides spiral, barred spiral and elliptical galaxies. In the background, shapes of much fainter galaxies, such as PGC 86788 at mag 17.30, PGC 2806871 at mag 16.34 and PGC 4563677 at mag 20.95 can be discerned. It is interesting to consider that while the light from all of these galaxies arrives at our telescope at the same time, the light from the fainter galaxies represent conditions tens of millions of years earlier than the light from the foreground galaxies.\r\n\r\nThis data was captured using a rented telescope that I've since stopped using because better data is available from Deep Sky West. I'd given up on this data years ago due to column defects, internal reflections and strong gradients, but decided to give it one more try. While the image is still a bit soft and fuzzy by my standards, I thought that it was worth sharing this interesting bit of the cosmos.",
