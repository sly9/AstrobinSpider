    "description": "This is an image I worked on for a while this winter.  SH2-308 never rises above 40 degrees in the sky from our location in Florida.  But it is such a cool looking object I couldn't resist trying to capture it.  I ended up with just over 32 hours of data in Ha and OIII.  I combined the filters into a HOO image.  (Hydrogen, Oxygen, Oxygen in place of Red, Green and Blue).  The object itself is a bubble created as a massive (20+ solar masses) Wolf-Rayet star blows off material.  The star has a 3.8 million mph stellar wind that has blown the material outwards so that the bubble is 60 light years in diameter.  This phase is relatively brief in the life of a massive star as they are generally thought to explode after a brief period of blowing these sorts of bubbles.  The bubble itself will eventually be wiped out by the supernova.",
