    "description": "I was definitely a little late on processing this one. Whoops! But better late than never I think. \r\n\r\nThis is the Statue of Liberty Nebula, located right near the core of the Milky Way, but below the horizon for most of in the Northern Hemisphere. An awesome target I loved since seeing it. My favorite part was always the \"Statue of Liberty\", until I edited. Now I am in love with the \"base\" and below portion of the statue. Just so intricate, something I never even noticed before. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
