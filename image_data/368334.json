    "description": "Image of NGC 6914 captured during August and September from my backyard using my 10\"f3.8 astrograph.  Imaging season has just now started along the US Gulf Coast so I decided to go back to this target I imaged 2 yrs ago with a 130mm refractor in the hopes of getting a bit more resolution. With Cygnus already near the meridian at dark I luckily had a period of excellent weather which usually doesn't arrive until mid September or early October.",
