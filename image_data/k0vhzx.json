    "description": "When a supernova was discovered in NGC 1637 in 1999, it immediately became the focus of very large telescopes...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/usa/images/eso1315a/\">NGC 1637 from ESO's Very Large Telescope</a>\r\n\r\nToday NGC 1637 is rarely imaged. Here's one from the Liverpool Telescope on Astrobin...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/108959/\">NGC 1637 from the Liverpool Telescope</a>\r\n\r\nAnd from Adam Block in a 16\" RC...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.caelumobservatory.com/obs/n1637.html\">NGC 1637 from Adam Block 16\" RC</a>\r\n\r\nI was hoping to get somewhere between ESO's VLT and Adam Block. (-; FWHM on 15 minute subs was around 2.5\" these nights, so not the best resolution. But I'm pleased to be able to extract the very faint spiral arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"NGC 1637 is a barred spiral galaxy that lies about 38 million light-years away in the southern constellation of Eridanus (the River). The galaxy is lit by the glow of about fifty billion stars. In its center lurks a supermassive black hole.\r\n\r\nIn 1999 scientists discovered a Type II supernova in this galaxy and followed its slow fading over the following years. Because of its relative proximity, SN 1999em got bright enough to be seen even with small telescopes, and it became one of the best observed supernovae of its day.\"\r\n\r\nMore info...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.kopernik.org/images/archive/n1637.htm?fbclid=IwAR2gLKMvu8RwT_BHSNrGx_IV04yKkZIjiRs5cbbjh6QcasVfV3kBsCh7bNA\">More NGC 1637 info</a>",
