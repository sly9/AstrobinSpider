    "description": "A few pictures from the 12-days old Moon with primary focus on the Aristarchus Plateau.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is forecasted to be unstable for another while, yet this should not be a fun brake. Tried it even with a 3x barlow with a yield of 50%. Good to have a small telescope.\r\n\r\nThe blurred stacks seduced strong sharpening but I resisted as someday when I grow big, I'll catch Aristarchus at zero turbulences, ha. \r\n\r\nSadly, Jupiter and Saturn were beyond the scope of my scope. The icon of the 22.37\"large Mars (RGB+IR850nm) is inserted to scale. All images are stacks of 600 frames at 138fps, under 6ms exposures at gain 200, in raw-8, 1.5x drizzled.",
