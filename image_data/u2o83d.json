    "description": "I tend to stick a long time with the same subject..From september on I spent most clear nights on IC342, the Hidden Galaxy.\r\nWhen I initially processed the first batch off +/- 15 hours, I was pleasantly surprised to see some color in the galaxy and in the very faint nebulosity areas….So I kept on adding more and more mainly RGB data..\r\nI reprocessed the data many times, but was not really able to pull out the nebulosity together with the color , lets say due to ‘inexperienced user errors’….\r\nI started again from scratch, ditched a lot off the original lesser quality data and added a few more ‘good’ RGB hours. \r\nI think the better data and the fact that I processed the ‘same’ stuff over and over again, trying not to redo all my previous mistakes (not to say that there are no flaws anymore in this image….), finally gave me more or less the image that I had in my mind…..\r\nData from september and november 2020.",
