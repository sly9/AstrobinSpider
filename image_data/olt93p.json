    "description": "My goal with this image was to show both the high resolution ring structure, and the two faint outer H-alpha shells. The small barred spiral galaxy IC 1296 was a nice bonus, I initially thought it would be too faint for my skies.\r\n\r\nI'm really pleased with the resolution of the core, I think seeing was fairly good. However the outer halos were again difficult to blend, as with my previous imaging project of a planetary nebula <a href=\"https://astrob.in/b92n4v/0/\">Cat&#39;s Eye Nebula: Halo - Rings - Core</a>",
