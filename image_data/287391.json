    "description": "This is an image of M82 with a significant amount of H-alpha added to the image.  I used my RCOS  14.5\" f/8 classical cassegrain and a Starlight Xpress 694 with Astrodon filters.  It was taken from my backyard observatory in Foresthill, CA.  The image is a standard LRGB with lum binned 1 X 1 and RGB binned 2 X 2.  H-alpha was binned 2 X 2.   To create the illusion that the image was made with a much larger telescope I reduced the stars using Russ Croman's superb StarShrink software.\r\nAdditional data:\r\n  LUM  12 X 900  1 X 1\r\n  RGB  12 X 900   2 X 2\r\n  H-alpha  12 X 1200  2 X 2\r\nProcessed with CCDStack, Deconvolution with AIP4WIN original version, the rest with PS CS 6 and various attending softwares like Noise Ninja.",
