    "description": "I first noticed this object as a faint blue streak near the crescent nebula in my wide-field image of Cygnus.  After some research I found it was a bubble nebula surrounding a variable star. \n\nSeeing as how I picked it up so easily at 50mm I figured it should be no problem at 700. Well after several attempts at processing I'm not sure this was an appropriate target for my gear,  an OSC camera with Duo-Narrowband filter makes it difficult to pull out faint Oiii.  Perhaps when I make the jump to Mono I'll revisit this target and really pour on the Oxygen data.",
