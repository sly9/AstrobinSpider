    "description": "I was fortunate enough to spend an entire night camping with my daughter Ayen, sitting atop Blackrock Summit in Shenandoah National Park in July, 2020. To make the experience even more amazing... it was the rare perfectly clear Virginia night. I honestly lost count of the number of shooting stars and satellites we saw. There's just something cool and special about laying on your back on the literal top of a mountain watching the universe in a dark sky location.\r\n\r\nTargets captured were wide angle milky way @24mm, Rho Ophuichi / Sagittarius @50mm, Sagittarius at 135mm, Andromeda @135mm, and Comet NEOWISE at 135mm to cap things off before sunrise, not to mention some sunrise and sunset shots.\r\n\r\nSpecs: Canon 6D, Rokinon 24mm @F2.8, 12x90\" second tracked sky shots on iOptron Skyguider, merged with non-tracked 160 second foreground shot (both ISO 800). stacked in Sequator, processed in Photoshop and Lightroom CC.",
