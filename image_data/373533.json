    "description": "Sharpless 2-170 (sometimes referred to as the Little Rosette Nebula) is an emission nebula that is around 7,500 light years away in the constellation of Cassiopeia.\r\n\r\nSh 2-170 was imaged between 5 and 9 October 2018 from two remote imaging rigs in Spain that are owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me.  In addition to gathering SHO data for a 'Hubble Palette' image, RG & B data were collected.  This is a HaOIII_RGB image with Ha mapped to the Red channel and OIII mapped to the Green and Blue channels.  \r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescopes: Takahashi FSQ 106 x2\r\nCamera: QSI 683 WSG x2\r\nFilters: Astrodon & Astronomik 5nm & 6nm NB\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS & 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 17 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 18 x 1200s\r\nRed: 12 x 600s\r\nGreen: 12 x 600s\r\nBlue: 12 x 600s\r\n\r\nA total of 17 hours 40 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData Capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
