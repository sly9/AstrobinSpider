I am indeed limited by the field of my scope to get the enrire chain ... but nonetheless , this part can be considred as the center of the chain  with beautiful galaxies. \r\n\r\nRed 25 subs@180s -20째C gain zero\r\nBlue 27 subs@180s -20째C gain zero\r\nGreen 23 subs@180s -20째C gain zero\r\nLight 67 subs@180s -20째C, gain zero\r\n\r\n 4 nights were necessary to get the subs: 07/08  of April 01/02,  02/03 and 09 of May\r\n\r\nWIKI :\r\nMarkarian's Chain is a stretch of galaxies that forms part of the Virgo Cluster. When viewed from Earth, the galaxies lie along a smoothly curved line. Charles Messier first discovered two of the galaxies, M84 and M86, in 1781. The other galaxies seen in the chain were discovered by William Herschel[1] and are now known primarily by their catalog numbers in John Louis Emil Dreyer's New General Catalogue, published in 1888.[2] It was ultimately named after the Armenian astrophysicist, Benjamin Markarian, who discovered their common motion in the early 1960s.[3] Member galaxies include M84 (NGC 4374), M86 (NGC 4406), NGC 4477, NGC 4473, NGC 4461, NGC 4458, NGC 4438 and NGC 4435.",
