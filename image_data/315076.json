    "description": "There's a lot of activity going on in this picture. One of the very youngest molecular clouds in the constellation of Perseus is NGC 1333. This beautiful nebula contains hundreds of stars that are as young as a million years old, and is one of the nearest star forming regions to us, at a distance of 1000 ly. Some of these protostars create outflows that collide with the surrounding medium to create Herbig-Haro objects. Many of them can be seen in the bright red emission regions within NGC1333. The blue nebulae in this image are areas of dust that are reflecting the light from the hot blue stars in front of the dust. Additionally, this image shows several dark nebulae where the dust obscures the light behind it, giving the stars their distinctive orange-brown color.",
