    "description": "Documentary film makers know that the pictures tells the audience the story, narration tells them what it means, and music tell them what to feel. The same footage and words can be ominous or inviting depending on the musical score.\r\n\r\nFor me, astrophotography evokes feelings of wonder, mystery, and drama. Pairing astrophotography with music can intensify and heighten those feelings. For example, here is a link to a 2 Â½ minute video that I recently produced. It combines my astrophotography, camera movement, and the music of Johann Johannsson. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.garylopezphotography.com/videos\r\n\r\nI have started a new topic in the Fine Art Astrophotography group, Astrophotography, Motion, and Music,  to share ideas and efforts.
