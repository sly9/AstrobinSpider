    "description": "The Cygnus Wall is a ridge of star-forming gas and dust about 20 million light-years long in the North America Nebula, NGC 7000. Like a mountain range carved by the erosion of water and wind, the Cygnus Wall is shaped by the energetic radiation of the young, hot stars nearby. The dark shapes that snake through the ridge are cooled gases and dust, the birth place of new stars.\r\n\r\nThe data for this image were collected in the summer of 2019. In this rendition I reprocessing and recompose the image to better present of the Wall.  This is one of my favorite DSO's with its craggy spine and the dusty veil sweeping across the middle of the ridge. I really like the pronounced three-dimensionality of this object created by the juxtaposition of shadow and color caused by the layers of gases.\r\n\r\nI want to thank Alan Pham for working with me to develop and refine processes to better retain structure and control noise. This image benefited from that work.",
