    "description": "Mouth of the beast or Devil's tongue with this menacing allure but certainly not God's hand ;-) !\r\n\r\nHere is one another great dark nebula with a bright red radiant outline due to the presence of hydrogen gas excited by the surrounding stars and is located about 1300 light years from Earth.\r\n\r\nThe head of the beast is 1.5 light years in diameter. The tail of the globule that extends to the right is about eight light years. By astronomical standards, this makes it a relatively small cloud.\r\nThe relatively small size is a general characteristic of these cometary globules. All of the cometary globules found so far are isolated, relatively small clouds of neutral gas and dust in the Milky Way, which are surrounded by hot ionized matter.\r\n\r\nThe head part of CG4 is a thick cloud of gas and dust, which is only visible because it is illuminated by light from nearby stars. The radiation emitted by these stars gradually destroys the head of the globule and erodes the tiny particles that scatter starlight. However, CG4's dusty cloud still contains enough gas to make several Sun-sized stars and indeed, CG4 is actively forming new stars. This may have been triggered when the radiation from the stars feeding the huge Gum Nebula nearby reached CG4.\r\n\r\nTwo beautiful small galaxies are also present in the image. First PGC21338, about to be swallowed by the beast, and NGC2427 in the lower left corner.",
