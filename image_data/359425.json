    "description": "Yet another M27 LRGB, NB version, why?\r\nWell, because it's a summer astro photography target up here/in Denmark, and it's an relatively \"easy target\" to catch :-)\r\nThe M27 nebula picture is composed as a MasterLUM, RHa,GOIII,BOIII picture.\r\nExposures were:\r\nLum=52x30sec, R=20x30sec, G=20x30sec, B=22x30sec. Ha=6x300sec, OIII=7x300sec.\r\nThe Master Lum consist of Luminance and narrow band info. blended together.\r\n\r\nIn DK CPH it's summer time, 25->30 degrees centigrade during daytime and the nights are bright.\r\n\r\nMy home build observatory is placed in my front yard/in the \"red light\" polution zone, have a look here,\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/lnr3elrgm81uj0i/Light-polution-mapDK.jpg?raw=1\"; target=\"_new\">Red Zone</a>\r\n\r\nKind regards Niels",
