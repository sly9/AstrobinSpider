    "description": "Thinking that IC1396 offers more than just the\"trunk\", I decided for the darkclouds you see in the pic here. It was a session already in september, when I imaged this data. This time I decided for a\r\n h alpha RGB. Processing this data was not on the top of my list, because I knew that the blue data was unfortunately a bit out of the frame of the rest. But now with a lot of time for processing because of cloudy weather, I startet to process a crop version, which is better than nothing. So it goes, when you detect a mistake too late. Hope you like it nevertheless.\r\n\r\nCS,Christoph",
