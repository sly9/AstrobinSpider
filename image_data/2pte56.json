    "description": "The Fighting Dragons in Ara are really tough to process, and my first attempts were really frustrating. Back in March I didn't have a clue how to deal with her, Pixinsight was still a foreign language to me.  \r\nSo after all the lessons learned while processing M42, I decided to give her a go, from complete scratch, and now she's finally starting to look more as I envisioned it  back then .\r\n(..too bad guiding wasn't that good either. )\r\n\r\nHope you guys like it too , clear skies!",
