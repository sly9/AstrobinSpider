    "description": "Reprocessed old data from 2016.\r\n\r\nI have been storing my data in my local NAS (DLink DNS345) and Backblaze.Even though I (probably) have all the data in the cloud service, , I prefer having the data in local NAS for the ease of accessing from multiple computers (about 5 TB of data ). The NAS's shares became inaccessible and  no matter what I did, I couldnt get it to work and it looked like the NAS was failing. I pulled the disks out and installed ext filesystem in windows and was able to access it (Phew). \r\n\r\nAs I was reviewing data, I figured it might be interesting to reprocess some old data. I have run out of new data in any case (And the weather is not looking good for imaging and I am working on a new rig setup as well).\r\n\r\nI picked up IC443 from 2016 .  This was shot from my backyard with the FSQ106 and ASI1600. The last time I processed it, I was not happy with the salmon pink color (HaOIII has been tough to process for me). I figured I will give it a go with Starnet and try to control the noise. The data is not deep enough for the stretch I wanted . OIII stack looked bad with lot of gradients. I wish I had shot some S2 for better mapping.  I couldnt do anything with the microlens artifacts of ASI1600. I did tweak the colors a bit more to be not-salmon-pink.. but there is not enough differentiation between the channels unfortunately.",
