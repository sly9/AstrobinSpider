    "description": "I hope everyone is enjoying the Holiday Season!\r\n\r\nHere we have my crack at M44, The Beehive Cluster or, with appropriate seasonality, Praesepe.\r\n\r\nThis open cluster lies about 580 light years away in Cancer and contains several hundreds of stars.  It is thought that since both M44 and The Hyades share similar morphology and proper motion, they may have a common origin.  (Credit Wikipedia and Messier-objects.com)\r\n\r\nThis was an enjoyable project to do over the course of a few weeks.  When I was processing, I thought I was seeing some faint nebulosity or dust in the field and I wanted to try to let that come through.  Most images I've seen of this show some halo effects around the bright stars which makes me think that there may be something to that.\r\n\r\nI wish everyone enjoyment in the season and best wishes for the coming year.  As always, any comments/criticism encouraged!",
