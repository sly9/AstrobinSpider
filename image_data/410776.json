    "description": "This object is a weakly barred 10th magnitude spiral galaxy located 50 million light years away in the constellation of Ursa Major.  The galaxy is large at a diameter of 140,000 light years.  It is 10 arc-minutes long in our apparent view.\r\n\r\nThe core of the galaxy is very small and the bar is hard to see.  Star clusters and Ha regions are visible in the arms.  I like the mottled dust areas seen to the right of the core, as well as the arms which wispfully extend out from the center.  For being such a pretty galaxy, it has not been studied much in the literature.\r\n\r\nNote the many tiny galaxies in this field of view, as well as the double star just to the lower left of NGC 3198.",
