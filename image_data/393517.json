    "description": "FSQ 106 with .6x reducer and ASI 1600 with 3nm Astrodon filters\r\nHa: 63 300 sec\r\nOIII: 47 300 sec\r\nSII: 54 300 sec\r\n\r\nI reprocessed this data and felt the improvements warranted the deletion of my previous attempts.  The toughest thing for me with this image was tiny star control without making it look artificial under full resolution viewing.  For processing, I am really beginning to appreciate just how fine the balance point is between the right settings and settings that are too much.\r\nVersion D was processed using the Light Vortex tutorial that indicates the stacks should be linear fitted to the brightest stack (Ha in this case) prior to channel combination.  It made the OIII and SII stacks very bright, and as a result the SHO image was very bright--I really had to struggle to tame it--and that led to a propensity for clipping--as this version is a bit clipped.  Not sure I have taken to the method, though details were preserved better I think\r\n\r\nVersion BK and beyond includes longer focal length data inserted into the image.  It really helps with increasing the resolution of higher detail areas.",
