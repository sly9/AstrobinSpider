    "description": "My attempt at a higher resolution image of the Jellyfish, compared to my numerous previous images of it with shorter focal length optics.  I'm pleased to see detail that I didn't know even existed.  I especially enjoy the swirls and intricate threads festooning the center of the image, reminiscent of those in the Crab Nebula, best viewed by clicking on the image to enlarge it a little to see them.  Data collection and processing in Maxim, with a log stretch and unsharp mask applied.  Stellar FWHM in the final image is a little over 2 arc-sec, no deconvolution applied.",
