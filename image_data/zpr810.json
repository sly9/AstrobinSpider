    "description": "Colorful stars, integrated flux nebulae, and a galaxy, what more can you ask for.  The centerpiece of this image is spiral galaxy  NGC 7497 located approximately 60 million light-years towards Pegasus.  This almost edge-on galaxy stands out well and does show some detail much to my surprise given the size of my scope.  This region also has faint clouds of interstellar dust which ride above the galactic plane and dimly reflect the Milky Way's combined starlight.  These clouds are known has integrated flux nebulae and are commonly associated with molecular clouds.  This region in home to the diffuse molecular cloud MBM 54, less than 1000 light-years years away.  There appears to be other small galaxies scattered throughout this region as well. \r\n\r\nDates: 9-18-20, 9-19-20, 10-7-20, 10-8-20, 10-9-20, 10-14-20\r\n\r\nhttps://kurtzeppetello.smugmug.com/\r\nhttp://astroquest1.blogspot.com/\r\nhttp://youtube.com/c/AstroQuest1",
