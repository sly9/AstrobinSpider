    "description": "Lynds Bright Nebula 406 is a molecular cloud in the constellation of Draco.  For reasons unknown to me, the nebula is sometimes referred to as the Laughing Skull Nebula.  \r\n\r\nJust below the nebula in this picture is a barred spiral galaxy that bears a mild resemblance to Saturn.  This is the catchily-named UGC 10548.\r\n\r\nLBN 406 was photographed between 16 and 25 June 2020 from an imaging rig in Spain that is privately owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me.  \r\n\r\nCapture Details:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM 1000 HPS \r\nCamera: QSI 683\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\n\r\nLum: 42 x 600s\r\nRed: 24 x 600s\r\nGreen: 24 x 600s\r\nBlue: 24 x 600s\r\n\r\nTotal exposure is 19 hours.\r\n\r\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Steve Milne",
