    "description": "This was a test, whether it makes sense trying to image this wonderful nebula directly from my backyard. During the shortest nights of the year I could spend three of them to collect some LRGB data and additional some H-Alpha data for the emission part and Ha-regions beside the nebula. With a max. height of 16 degrees over horizon I think it was worth the effort. :-)\r\n\r\nI found some interesting backgroud informations regarding the name of M20: Its name means 'divided into three lobes'. The object is an unusual combination of an open cluster of stars; an emission nebula (the lower, red portion), a reflection nebula (the upper, blue portion) and a dark nebula (the apparent 'gaps' within the emission nebula that cause the trifurcated appearance; these are also designated Barnard 85).",
