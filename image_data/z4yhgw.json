These are known as “Thackeray’s Globules” in this nebula, but as “Bok’s Globules” more generally. A study of these features suggests that they are evaporating rapidly, the what we observe are the remaining fragments of what was once one or more larger dark clouds. A close-up of one of the more structured globules appears Here: https://www.astrobin.com/1hecsf/?nc=user",
