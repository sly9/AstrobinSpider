    "description": "Last year in November we moved to a house in the same area but with the Southern view much better than the one we used to live before that. \r\n\r\nKnowing that I now have the chance to shoot some targets that I could never think of from the old house, I decided to push my limits and try a target that I wanted for a very long time. \r\n\r\nNGC2359 is passing the meridian above London at 25 degrees in altitude so this is a difficult target considering the circumstances.  \r\n\r\n I think it would've been much better with a 4.5nm Oiii filter but I'm still waiting for it as it seems that no one has it in stock. \r\n\r\nI hope you like it. \r\n\r\nEmil",
