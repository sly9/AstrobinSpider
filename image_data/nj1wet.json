    "description": "Funny how I never had an image of this object by itself until now. I had some data of it in wider field images, along with some that included M8, but this is the first time it is by its lonesome. \r\n\r\nI love M20 though, I feel like it is often overshadowed by its big brother M8. Hopefully this image does it justice when it is on its own! \r\n\r\nThanks for looking, and as always, clear skies!",
