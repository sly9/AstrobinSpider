    "description": "The Grus Quartet consists of four large spiral galaxies - NGC 7552 (not shown), 7582, 7590, and 7599 - situated at declination -42Â° in the southern constellation Grus, the Crane.\r\n\r\nThree of them (NGC 7582, 7590, and 7599, shown) are close together; the fourth (NGC 7552) is approximately 30' to the northwest, out of the scope of this image to the lower left corner. Will try to capture it later and combine them.\r\n\r\nThe quartet lies about 60 million light years beyond the foreground stars. The four galaxies are believed physically very close and strongly interacting.",
