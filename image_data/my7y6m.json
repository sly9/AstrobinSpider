    "description": "Reminds me on a big Mantis with its triangular head, sitting on the M87 blossom :-)\r\n\r\nThe exposures went deep enough to show traces of the tidal streams, to the north of \"the Eyes\", and to the west of NGC4388, the galaxy at the mandibles of the Mantis. Further, there is a stream of weak light north of M87, connecting it to NGC4461 and 4458, the galaxy pair east of the Eyes. South of the Eyes and NGC4425, there is another weak stream, and on other places in the picture too. It is not clear whether these are traces of IFN from our galaxy, or actually distributed there in the core of the Virgo galaxy cluster.  Especially around M87, you see a lot of weak dots that are just the brightest of its estimated 15.000 globular clusters.",
