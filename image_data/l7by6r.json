    "description": "During my October trip to Casitas de Gila, Gila NM, I worked on better automation of an imaging session using two targets in a night.  The early target was the Wizard nebula.  When Orion was high enough in the sky, I switched to Barnard 33, the Horsehead Nebula.  I also experimented with increased gain for imaging with the Hydrogen-alpha (Ha) filter.  Since B33 is rather faint, I sacrificed dynamic range for increased signal to noise ratio.  This worked quite well for the Ha data.  B33 is a Ha emission nebula in the constellation Orion, located near the bright star Alnitak in Orion’s belt.  With my Celestron 9.25” SCT fitted with a 0.7x focal reducer, I included the reflection nebula NGC 2023.  This made processing of Ha and Luminance data a real challenge.  The three brightest, bloated stars remain as a processing issue.",
