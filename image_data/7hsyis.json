    "description": "Sorry, I'm a little late to the M101 party. (-:\r\n\r\nI wasn't planning on shooting M101 this year. But I changed my plans while working on <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/3lr1yz/\">NGC6340 and neighbors in Draco (Deep)</a>. The seeing was just too good to pass it up.\r\n\r\nI could only get good results from 9:15 PM to around 11:30 PM. So it took over a week to collect what you see here.\r\n\r\nThe 32 15-minute luminance subs were between 1.42\" and 2.32\". Average was 2.03\" before deconvolution. Given seeing is usually measured as described <a href=\"https://www.sbscientific.com/products/new-seeing-monitor/seeing-monitor-2/\">here</a>, we suspect this is seeing under 1\".\r\n\r\nSo here's my late 2020 M101 contribution to Astrobin â€“ with a little touch of Ha to finish it off.
