    "description": "Messier 35 and its companion NGC 2158 are a popular motif in the winter sky. The two simply form a pretty pair, as unlike as they are. Messier 35 is about 6 times closer to us than NGC 2158, and it is also the much younger star cluster of both.\r\nMessier 35 has been on my wish list for a long time, but so far it was never intended that a useful picture would come out. Therefore I invested quite a lot of time this winter - in three nights about 10 hours came together. Luminance 68x4 min, RGB 32x4 min per filter.",
