    "description": "Beta Andromedae, also known as Mirach, is the central figure of this image.  Mirach is a red giant close to the end of it’s stellar life.  It is about 100 times larger than the sun, and about 2000 times brighter.  Mirach is often used as a pointer star to the Andromeda Galaxy.  Above and to the left of Mirach is what appears to be an apparition or ghost of the star.  Hence it’s name, Mirach’s Ghost.  This is actually NGC 404, a dwarf lenticular galaxy discovered in 1784 by the British astronomer, William Herschel.  NGC 404 is thought to have once been a spiral galaxy, but has since become a lenticular through a galactic collision about 1 billion years ago.  The light creating this image left Mirach some 200 years ago.  As for it’s ghost, NGC 404, those photons have been traveling for 10 million years. \r\n\r\nEven though the title of this image may elicit a few scary thoughts appropriate for the Halloween season, I find my exploration of the cosmos peaceful and reassuring.  I relate to this expression by Sarah Williams...\r\n\r\n“I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night”\r\n\r\nThis image represents a few firsts for me.  It is my first deep sky post here on Astrobin, since I had set imaging aside for a few years.  It is my first image taken with a new scope and my first processed with PI (although I must confess, I did pull it in to photoshop at the end :-).  I am pretty rusty, but sure love the feeling I have missed of taking in the grandeur and wonder of the cosmos.\r\n\r\nChosen as NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day on October 17, 2017\r\nPublished in Sept 2018 issue of Sky and Telescope",
