    "description": "MWP1 (Match-Werner-Pakull), PNG 80.8-10.6, is an unusual planetary nebula in Cygnus. In addition to being one of the larger planetary nebulas, it is perhaps the oldest visible with an estimated age of 150,000 years.  Additional, the progenitor star is one of the hottest known.  Distance estimates for MWP1 vary from 1500-4500 light years away.",
