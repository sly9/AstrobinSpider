    "description": "Well...my QHY600M camera is still down, so I decided to connect my ASI1600MMPro to the TOA-130.  Honestly, this image came out much better than I was expecting.  I brought the gain down a bit and increased my exposure time.  When I saw the first frames I thought the glow along the right side was going to totally obscure the faint nebulosity there, but I was surprised that the cal frames were able to bring it all back.\r\n\r\nMuch happier with this version than my previous attempt using my SCT.",
