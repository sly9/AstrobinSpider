    "description": "After new collimation of my edge 11, I tested my new Chroma OIII 3nm filter on M 97. Even that filter was extremely expensive, I can say that I am happy with it. Through my light polluted backyard sky, I could catch up the faint halo of the owl, which was my hope. In addition to new OIII data I also captured new luminance and h alpha subs, which payed out. Hope you like the new version.\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
