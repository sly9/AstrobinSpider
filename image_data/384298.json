    "description": "IC 2944, also known as the Running Chicken Nebula. This is my second attempt at this beautiful nebula. This is also my forth target in the last three weeks while on holiday. I have been very lucky to have clear skies in a Bortle 1-2 environment. The moon was the only visitor who added to my post processing times. \r\n\r\nSome https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_2944 information :- IC 2944, also known as the Running Chicken Nebula or the 位 Centauri Nebula, is an open cluster with an associated emission nebula found in the constellation Centaurus, near the star 位 Centauri. It features Bok globules, which are frequently a site of active star formation. However, no evidence for star formation has been found in any of the globules in IC 2944.\r\n\r\nThe ESO Very Large Telescope image on the right is a close up of a set of Bok globules discovered in IC 2944 by South African astronomer A. David Thackeray in 1950. These globules are now known as Thackeray's Globules. In 2MASS images, 6 stars are visible within the largest globule.\r\n\r\nThe region of nebulosity visible in modern images includes both IC 2944 and IC 2948, as well as the fainter IC 2872 nearby. IC 2948 is the brightest emission and reflection nebulae towards the southeast, while IC 2944 is the cluster of stars and surrounding nebulosity stretching towards 位 Centauri.",
