    "description": "NGC 7771 together with NGC 7770 (the small Sa-spiral) and NGC 7769 are rougly 196MLy away and form an interacting triplet. The tidal streams from NGC 7771 reach up to 20000Ly into intergalactic space. The SA(rs)-type NGC 7769 has tital streams, that mimics far reaching galaxy arms. However, this is only due to the symmetry of the filaments. \r\nOn the right there is some galactic nebulosity from our own galaxy just barely visible.\r\n\r\nShot during heavy fogging in the first nights during fall. Had to drop many frames ...",
