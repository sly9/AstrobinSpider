    "description": "At this point itâ€™s fairly well known that this comet has fractured into several pieces on approach to the Sun. As such, the hopes that it will ever reach the predicted brightness are dashed. A month ago, this was forecast to be visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nIt is currently diving to the Sun, making a closest approach at the end of May. Based on its unstable nature, it will likely disperse after that event, never to be seen again.\r\n\r\nThis particular shot was from April 14. It shows the bright green nucleus with an elongated, lumpy core along the direction of travel.",
