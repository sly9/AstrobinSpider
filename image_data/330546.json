    "description": "Here we have the Pleiades aka Messier 45, bathing amongst the very faint golden galactic cirrus which spans across the constellation of Taurus.  The dust that you see here is actually not emitting light but rather reflecting.  It is partially illuminated by the bright 7 stars within the Pleiades and additionally illuminated by our milky way galaxy.  \r\n\r\nI am unclear of the distinction between IFN and galactic cirrus, Galactic cirrus seems to be closer to the core of the milky way.  IFN and Galactic cirrus both actually appear in IRAS and Planck thermal dust surveys. Regarding molecular structure, I have read that IFN is comprised of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons which are essentially leftover burned up carbon remains.  The IFN reflects light predominantly at 540nm up through 950nm according to Mandel Wilson. \r\n\r\nCapturing Galactic cirrus and the bluish gray dust surrounding the pleiades requires very dark skies and deep integrations of data which must be carfeully processed.  I am not 1005 happy with this image yet and there may be a few more renditions, but I hope you enjoy what I have presented.  \r\n\r\n\r\nEquipment and image capture:\r\n\r\nCameras: Tandem Canon DSLR\r\nFull Spectrum modded T2i\r\nUnmodded T3i\r\n\r\nLenses: Samyang 135mm F2 on each camera\r\n\r\nFilter: T2i only, Astronomik Clip Luminance L3\r\n\r\nLight frames: 468\r\nExposures:30s\r\nIso: 1600\r\nDarks: 70\r\nFlats:200\r\nBias: pre established master\r\n\r\nSeeing was 4/5\r\nTransparency 5/5\r\nTemp 25f\r\nSQM 21.6\r\n\r\nData was Fully Claibrated, stacked and registered in Pixinsight. \r\nThen partially processed between Pixinisght and Photoshop CC 2018",
