    "description": "The week was a busy one and I was tired and I realized pretty late that we had actually a crystal clear sky. The weather app was checked but fog was nowcasted and I was kind of reluctant to go out into the cold and setup. But I sad to myself: it is Friday night without moon and you have a clear sky. Prime Time! So I was setting up late, started at 11pm and had my first sub recorded at midnight and finally I was able to collect 36 subs in the end before the fog arrived finally! \r\n\r\nCS & Enjoy\r\n\r\nHere the Ha version can be found:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/dhmb9d/B/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/dhmb9d/B/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
