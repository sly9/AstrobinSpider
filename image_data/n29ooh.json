    "description": "The OIII data for this nice planetary nebula is quite strong, so I decided to re-process my data and show more of the blue colors which are normally represented by the OIII wavelength. \r\n\r\nFor Luminace I tried to combine the signal from H-Alpha and OIII which worked really good in this case. This leads to the fact that the PN shows a smooth structure over the whole surface and not only in the very strong areas.",
