    "description": "The neighborhood of the Iris Nebula in Cepheus holds more secrets. This arrow-shaped complex is LBN 468 with lots of swirling bright and dark nebulosity.\r\n\r\nA very interesting and small structure, resembling a tiny comet, can be found at the tip of the arrow. This is the Herbig-Haro object known as HH 215 or Gyulbudaghian's Nebula. It consists of a jet of gas streaming from the variable protostar, PV Cephei, and it varies in brightness and shape as the progenitor star brightens and darkens.\r\n\r\nThis is an LRGB composite of 24 L and 16 R, G and B exposure of 900sec each, taken at the Deep Sky West Observatory.",
