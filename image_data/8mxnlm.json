    "description": "A mysterious blue eye hidden inside red flame is quite striking.  A 10-day window in July gave me time to capture enough frames both two subjects.  This is the one after NGC7380.  There isn't much s2 signal on this target.  The photo is constructed by ha and o3 data. Stars were captured separately through RGB.\r\n\r\nDates:\r\n7/12/20, 7/13/20, 7/14/20, 7/16/20, 7/17/20, 7/18/20, 7/20/20, 7/21/20, 7/23/20, 7/24/20\r\n\r\nFrames:\r\nha: 57x600s\r\no3: 60x600s\r\nRGB: 30x120s each",
