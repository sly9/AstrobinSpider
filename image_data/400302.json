    "description": "These past nights in BsAs were dreamed for astrophotography : no wind, no moon and no clouds. For the last 3 nights I imaged the Prawn Nebula, IC4628, my main obstacle was my guiding which unfortunatley got worse night by night, but in the end I managed to capture some good data and I'm very pleased with the results.\r\nHere's to celebrate our first image of a Black Hole\r\nclear skies everyone!",
