    "description": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nthis is a pretty large scale mosaic of the region around the star Sadr in Cygnus. I really love this region I have to say. But I only published an image once in a really really wide field (135mm focal length). So I wanted to give this another go in higher resolution. Since there is so much beauty in this area I opted to create a 3x2 mosaic stretching out to the Crescent nebula and trying to include the soap bubble. This is the biggest mosaic I have ever done so far.\r\n\r\nIn this image I also experimented more with my editing process to create a more balanced variation of colors. Obviously OIII is very much accentuated here. Additionally red is a combination of Ha and SII. I feel this gives more structure in the image. It's hard to summarize everything to get to this as it's basically a sum of different techniques I've learned from different \r\npeople over the years.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the look of the region :)",
