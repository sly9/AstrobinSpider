    "description": "An elusive Phantom Galaxy (M 74/NGC 628), a grand-design spiral galaxy in the constellation Pisces. This image is a combination of LHaRGB exposures obtained with the 250 mm f/4 Lacerta PhotoNewton and ASI183MM Pro camera over several nights in September-November 2020.  \r\n\r\nThe luminance image is a combination of series of 30s, 90s and 180s exposures to expand the dynamic range and reduce the effects of atmospheric turbulence. The L exposures were captured with camera gain of  53, 110 and 200, while RGB and H-alpha exposures were taken at gain 110 and 200:\r\n\r\nL:   45x180s (Gain 53, bin 1x1), 69x90s (Gain 110, bin 1x1), 185x30s (Gain 200, bin 1x1)\r\nR:   42x180s (Gain 110, bin 1x1)\r\nG:   45x180s (Gain 110, bin 1x1)\r\nB:   43x180s (Gain 110, bin 1x1)\r\nHa: 12x600s(Gain 200, bin 1x1)\r\n\r\nTotal exposure: 14.0 hours",
