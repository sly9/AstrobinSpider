    "description": "2.3miljion lightyears away lies our closest neighbour which we call Andromeda. It contains, just like our own Milkyway galaxy, triljons of stars and who knows, alien civilisation.\r\nThis image was taken from my backyard under bortle class 7 skies due to severe light pollution in our little country The Netherlands. I used a dedicated astrocam and several hours of combined exposures through Luminance, Red, Green, Blue and Hydrogen alpha filters.\r\n\r\nEverytime I'm just stunned with what we can capture just from our backyards.",
