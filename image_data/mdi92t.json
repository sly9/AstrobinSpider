    "description": "The Ring Nebula \"Au Naturale\" ?\r\n\r\nOk, maybe not with the Ha and OIII, but that was my goal. (-:\r\n\r\nI wasn't planning on shooting the Ring this month because it's only positioned well for two hours each evening. But Boris' version really resonated with me...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/ymyc23/\">50 hours of Ring Nebula by Boris Emchenko</a>\r\n\r\nSome of you may remember my first Ring Nebula in my 8\" in 2017...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/296369/\">8 hours of Ring by KG in 8\"</a>\r\n\r\nSo here's what I could gather at 2 hours/evening in a 24\" before the moon became too bright.\r\n\r\nI started with the \"Au Naturale\" LRGB and subtly overlayed Ha and OIII for the \"ring fingers\". Only 2 hours of Ha and OIII, but just enough I think to show the structure without overpowering the LRGB.",
