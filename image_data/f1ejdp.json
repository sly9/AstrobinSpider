    "description": "A spectacular nearby spiral galaxy, M 106 (NGC 4258), harboring a Seyfert 2 type active nucleus. The image is a combination of LHaRGB exposures obtained with the 250 mm f/4 Lacerta PhotoNewton and ASI183MM Pro camera over several nights in February-April 2020. Also seen in the wider field image is a small interacting companion NGC 4248, presumably responsible for the tidal distortion of the M 106 outer disk. \r\n\r\nThe luminance data was captured with camera gain 0, while the RGB and H-alpha exposures were taken at gain 53 and 200:\r\n\r\nL: 52x300s (Gain 0, bin 1x1)\r\nR: 30x300s (Gain 53, bin 1x1)\r\nG: 29x300s (Gain 53, bin 1x1)\r\nB: 25x300s (Gain 53, bin 1x1)\r\nHa: 26x600s (Gain 200, bin 1x1)\r\n\r\nTotal exposure: 15.7 hours",
