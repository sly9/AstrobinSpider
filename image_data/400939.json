    "description": "This galaxy likes somewhere around 50 million light years away in the constellation of Canes Venatici (Hunting Dogs).    This delicate spiral shows some warpage if the outer arms and that hints at a merger or interaction with another galaxy at some point.\r\n\r\nThis galaxy is also known to be a Seyfert-type which means it harbors a very active supermassive black hole at the core.   Remember that pic you couldnâ€™t get enough of this this week!!?!   Just like that.   In fact, science has revealed it to be offset from the rotational center of the galaxy which is further supporting evidence of a past interaction.   Being offset, the black hole remains well-fed and is one of the reasons it is so active (and massive).\r\n\r\nThis image ended up being presented at about half the capture scale and with a significant crop due to an offensive star.  The color data just needed a bit more time.  Perhaps a revision will come to address that and expand the FOV a bit.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy!!",
