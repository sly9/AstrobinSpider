    "description": "*** Was able to add data from 2017-07-29 to bring out the Oiii in the region as well as bring more definition and color to the Oiii envelope***\r\n\r\nI finally had some clear nights and of course they were during an almost full moon.  Despite the moon I just had to get out, so this was imaged over two nights with an average of 90% moon.   I captured 1.75 hours of SII as well, but the signal is weak and with this limited integration all I could seem to do was neutralize color and add noise.  I ended up settling on HOO as the signal was really good for both of these channels despite a short integration.  I'm going to spend some more time on this if I get the chance.  Dark skies would really make this target stand out.",
