    "description": "Sky conditions were significantly better than two weeks ago. Saturn is now reaching 30 degrees high while it is dark enough to image. It will transit 42 degrees from my location, just a few degrees higher than last apparition.\n\nThe southern hemisphere has a blue hue while the north has a green tint near the pole.",
