    "description": "NGC 1532 was a galaxy I did not really know existed for a very long time. However, once I finally saw 1 image of it that I loved, it seemed like it began to pop up everywhere. Apparently, it is known as the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, almost like the filters :) \r\n\r\nOne thing I did find interesting about this target though is that it does not have an ARP designation. For how funky it is, I find that a bit peculiar.",
