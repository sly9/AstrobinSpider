    "description": "This was supposed to be a 2 panel mosaic showing a cluster of galaxies in this region... and I got 2 panel worth of data. However, the sky conditions were quite bad apparently, even though I shot both panel on same days , both Panels ended up with very different SNR after DBE and after trying to see if I can clean it up, I just stopped doing  it and processed panel 1 itself containing M58.\r\n\r\nI really should try this target with the Edge11 (hoping to get it back on the mount soon) but it still looks nice with the other interacting pair in the field.",
