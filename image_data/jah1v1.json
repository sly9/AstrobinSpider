    "description": "Finding my steps slowly in the photo editing I think this is my first photo that I am really happy with the result.\r\nWith my very small telescope (WO 61) but with many hours of exposure I was able to capture a lot of details of the Rosette Nebula and with the processing of the material I was able to enhance them even more. \r\nThanks for visiting",
