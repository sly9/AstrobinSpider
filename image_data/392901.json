    "description": "Messier 81 (Bode’s Galaxy, NGC 3031) is approximately 12 million light years away in the constellation of Ursa Major.  It was first observed by Johann Elert Bode in 1774, and observed by Charles Messier on 9 February 1781 (from O’Meara, ‘Messier Objects 2nd Edition; 2014).  The relatively young (200 million light year) dwarf, irregular galaxy, Holmberg IX) can also be seen.\r\n\r\nData for this object were collected between 14 January and 13 February 2019 from a remote imaging rig in Spain that is owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC 140 \r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon \r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 24 x 1200s\r\nLum: 48 x 600s\r\nRed: 24 x 600s\r\nGreen: 24 x 600s\r\nBlue: 24 x 600s\r\n\r\nA total of 28 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData Capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
