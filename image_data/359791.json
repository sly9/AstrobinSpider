    "description": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nphew that was a tough one. M27 really has a lot of dynamic range and getting it all in a single type of exposure was a challenge. My goal for this image was to figure out whether I could image the faint halo of it with my little APO with enough patience and I can officially report success :) \r\n\r\nThis is also the first time I have replaced my narrowband stars with RGB ones. Something I plan to do more often from now on.\r\n\r\nAfter doing extensive research into optimal exposures and a lot of math I figured out, that 10m exposures were way too long. I should have used ~3.4m for my total of 5 hours per channel. For 10m exposures to make sense I would have had to shoot a whooping 38h per channel. Well, that's something to know for next time :)",
