    "description": "The Draco Group (or Triplet) consists (from left to right) NGC 5985, NGC 5982 and NGC 5981.  According to the Webb Deep-Sky Society website, the approximate distances to these galaxies are: NGC 5985 - 120 million light years; NGC 5982 - 130 million light years; and NGC 5981 - 100 million light years.  A number of other galaxies are visible in this cropped view of the triplet.\r\n\r\nThe Draco Group was photographed between 10 and 15 June 2021 from our imaging rig in Spain.  Capture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC 140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nLum: 63 x 600s\r\nRed: 48 x 300s\r\nGreen 48 x 300s\r\nBlue: 48 x 300s\r\n\r\nA total of 22 hours and 30 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Steve Milne",
