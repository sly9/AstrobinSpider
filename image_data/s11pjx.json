    "description": "The first image I posted to Astrobin 4 years ago was the California Nebula--and I have not imaged it again until this image.  I reprocessed the old data a few weeks ago to better effect, but there is only so many times one can whittle the same stick as it were.  So, the Moon was up, suggesting narrow band would be most appropriate.  NGC 1499 was in prime position.  I have looked forward to imaging this target again with the larger FOV--I almost got it all. but it is a LONG nebula.  It seems that the primary goal for me when processing this target is to avoid over-processing.  Its a fuzzy line though that has a frustrating tendency to jump around.  There is a lot of structure to this nebula--but not all of it is able to be revealed with high dynamic range, or high color range for that matter.   Maintaining a gaseous appearance while highlighting the ridgelines and dark structures of the internal landscape is a challenge.  I grew tired of looking at the nebula in its normal orientation--it was getting burned into my retina.  So I decided to try an alternate orientation.  I have included the original orientation for those who like it better--its the same image, just turned.  I think the target's position in the FOV is better in the original orientation and that is how it was framed for imaging.  For the \"upside down\" orientation That I have labeled \"final\", I think the target could have been pushed a bit upward in the FOV.  But I like the alternate view, at least for now.  Seeing was good for most of the shoot. I almost forgot what it was like to look up at the night sky and see too many stars to count!\r\n\r\nFor the pixel peepers--I am in discussion with TAK regarding the star issue, to rule out optical alignment causes.",
