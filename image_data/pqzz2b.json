    "description": "Barnard 150 is a dark nebula that has long inspired me and I've always wanted to photograph. However I wanted to try to a bit of context to where it is located so I've included a small part of the much larger SH2-129. This one was started in early August but the weather was not very co-operative so only just completed last night.",
