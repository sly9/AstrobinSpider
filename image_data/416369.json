    "description": "I decided to try a bit of lunar imaging with my DSO setup. This was done with an RC8 telescope, a QHY163M mono cooled CMOS camera and a Baader red filter. I definitely can improve on the image since I later realized I used a high-resolution/low frame rate configuration for capture. RCs are not the best telescopes for planetary imaging, but I think its a lot of fun to challenge these established truths...",
