    "description": "Since there are hardly any distinct shadows right after full moon, I tried to add some \"depth\" with moderate processing. This session centers on the eastern limb with crater Humboldt being most prominent. The larger craters in the middle of the two-panel mosaic are from left to right, Langrenus, Petavius (with Rimae) and Fumerius. All images are in 8-bit mono captured with an IR742nm pass filter because of unsteady air. Clouds ended the session without time for a mosaic of the entire 99.4% illuminated, 15.4 days old moon at a distance of about 352700 kilometers.",
