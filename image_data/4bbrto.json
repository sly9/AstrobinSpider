    "description": "Really beautiful object catalogued as 881 on the  Lynds' Catalogue of Dark Nebulae.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the jewels that you could find on gamma Cygni nebula, on SADR region of Cygnus, one of my favorites regions of the sky.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://astro.carballada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hdFZpI8l.jpg\"/>\r\n(credits Aladin)\r\n\r\n\"A dark nebula or absorption nebula is a type of interstellar cloud that is so dense that it obscures the visible wavelengths of light from objects behind it, such as background stars and emission or reflection nebulae. The extinction of the light is caused by interstellar dust grains located in the coldest, densest parts of larger molecular clouds.\" (wiki)\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to integrate more than 70 hours to show all faint and nice details on the estructure.\r\n\r\nHere was captured using the HSO palette, please also check my natural palette on this link:\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/lj25m9/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/lj25m9/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
