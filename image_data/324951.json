    "description": "This is from more than two years old data when I just started astrophotography, which I now revisited and reprocessed. It is only five 5 min exposures so I must have been quite lucky with the sky since there is not much noise and quite a lot of detail. I post it as a new image as it is now significantly improved with the processing skills I have gain over two years. And, in any case it is cloudy so I have no new data to work on.",
