    "description": "I had a chance for the first time to capture subs outside of my red zone. I was about one mile from a dark site in northern Michigan. I decided to capture something very faint; something almost impossible here in my red zone. I did Luminance first just in case the rest of the weekend was a bust. Sure enough, it was and had to do all my RGBs in my red zone here unfortunately. Spent 2 nights doing RGB all night both nights. I have a feeling given how faint this dark nebula is, two more nights would yield little more in my red zone.",
