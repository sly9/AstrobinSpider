    "description": "Hi all.\r\nThe new RH 200 MKII is nearly ready to roll - a few tweaks yet to be done to improve a few aspects but nothing major.  The test data was very nice, hopefully, the image demonstrates that.\r\n\r\nAt just 10.5 hours including Ha the benefits of such a fast scope are clear to see.\r\n\r\nAs well as the nice blue reflection around the Christmas Tree Cluster area which structurally seems to be lifted out from the red emissions, I was also interested to see the nice yellow tones appearing just below the cone.\r\n\r\nHope yu enjoy.",
