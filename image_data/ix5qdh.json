    "description": "This is one-half of the data set with 2600 MC pro and Space cat 51. This was planned to be 21 panel mosaic, but due to other rotational issues and other systems not being perfectly aligned had to shoot another 10 to fill in the missing hole. \r\nMost parts of the data were shot from Bortle 9 skies with L-extreme and STC duo band filter.\r\n\r\nMosaic was assembled in APP and  EZ-processing suite in Pixinsight to stretch.\r\n\r\nFar from done, next onto Merging Ha & OIII data and some cleanup.",
