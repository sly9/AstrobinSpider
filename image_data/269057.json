    "description": "This is older data from August and has less exposure time than usual and really bad star shapes in the bottom right corner so for a long time I had just discarded this dataset. But now that it has been cloudy for a long time straight I guess I'm desperate and willing to accept worse data than usual :p So as a result I decided to process this thing. Up close it's somewhat ugly due to the require noise reduction and star shapes but as a smaller image it's fine. ",
