    "description": "I've been reluctant to do LRGB from the backyard as I'm so close to the city but I'm becoming more convinced good results are possible, at least when the moon is below the horizon. Spent a few nights gathering data with a view to doing an HDR luminance to capture the central stars. Not sure that it was needed at all but they are there. Framing of the wider field image emulates Andy Campbell's image which includes M21. I've also added a close up where some of the detail is more obvious.",
