    "description": "A photogenic Draco Trio (NGC 5981, NGC 5982 and NGC 5985) imaged over several nights in April-May 2020 with the 250 mm f4.0 Lacerta PhotoNewton and ZWO ASI183MM Pro camera. The elliptical galaxy NGC 5982 (center) is exhibiting a well-defined shell structure presumed to be a result of multiple mergers with smaller galaxies. The spiral galaxy NGC 5985 (left) is located at the distance close to that of NGC 5982 (135~137 Mly). The recessional velocity of the third member of the \"trio\", the edge-on spiral NGC 5981 (right) puts it at a much closer distance of ~86 Mly.\r\n\r\nThe luminance exposures were taken at camera gain 0 and RGB at gain 53:\r\n\r\nL: 76x300s (Gain 0, bin 1x1)\r\nR: 44x300s (Gain 53, bin 1x1)\r\nG: 23x300s (Gain 53, bin 1x1)\r\nB: 26x300s (Gain 53, bin 1x1)\r\n\r\nTotal exposure: 14.1 hours",
