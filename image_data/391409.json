    "description": "Esta imagem (original) foi processada no Workshop de Processamento de Imagem de Céu Profundo em Astronomia Amadora, em 16 de fevereiro, no Centro de Ciência Viva - Planetário do Porto.\r\n\r\n*************************************\r\n\r\n* Image acquisition by: <a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/users/IrvingPieters/\">Irving Pieters</a>.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n\r\nThe Rosette Nebula is one of the most wonderful clouds of gas that we can contemplate and its location is propitious to observations from the two hemispheres, being enough binoculars or telescope of small size; as such, is one of the most appreciated by astrophotographers.\r\n\r\nThis object is also known as Caldwell 49, and is an HII region located near the edge of a giant molecular cloud in the constellation of Monoceros.\r\n\r\nThe nebula is about 5,200 light-years away from Earth, measuring about 130 light-years across, and its mass has been estimated at 10,000 solar masses. The radiance of the young and warm stars excites the atoms in the nebula, causing the brightness that we observe.\r\n\r\nHere we can highlight the following areas:\r\n• NGC 2244 corresponding to the agglomerate open in the darkest central zone and\r\n• Long dark clouds of gas and dust.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/396368/C/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/396368/C/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
