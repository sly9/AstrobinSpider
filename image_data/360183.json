    "description": "This is my \"second\" target after Veil moves past zenith.\r\n\r\nMy system has a tilt that I am working on fixing it. So the stars suffered (The edges were getting bloaty stars)\r\n\r\nAgain, the OIII filter's underwhelming performance (coupled with KAF8300's low sensitivity there) can be seen. There is quite a bit more OIII in there .\r\n\r\nThis is the second image with Baader 8.5nm OIII and I am not very impressed with it and I also see reflection with OIII in bright stars.. sigh",
