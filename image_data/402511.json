    "description": "Earlier in the week the sun was producing some serious solar flares (Proms)  In between clouds I took a 2000 frame AVI file of the Proms and an equal number of frames for the surface..... using an ASI174MM-C camera on a Vixen ED81s refractor.  I used the Quark Chromosphere by Daystar along with an IR/UV Cut filter.   I kept the best 5 percent of the images from both videos. I used Autostakkert to align and cull the best 5 percent of both videos - then RegiStax for a very modest adjustment of the wavelets - finally I composited (blended) both images in PSCC.   I have a lot to learn about both solar acquisition and post processing....but the fun is in the learning!",
