    "description": "What started off as a quick hour and a half acquisition of data turned into a 7 hour project. Initially collected the RGB as binned 2x2, with 300sec exposures but changed my mind part way through and only collected binned 1x1 (600sec exposures). Luminance was also captured using 600sec exposures. I’m still learning the ins and outs of astrophotography made a few mistakes along the way but I’m pretty happy with the result.\r\n\r\nThanks for viewing and clear skies everyone!\r\n\r\nIntegration Times, Filters, and Software:\r\nLuminance: 3.2 hrs total \r\nRed:  1.4 hrs total\r\nGreen: 1.4 hrs total \r\nBlue: 1.2 hrs total\r\n\r\nTotal integration: 7.2 hrs\r\n\r\nSoftware: AstroPixel Processor, Pixinsight Photoshop,",
