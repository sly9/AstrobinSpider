    "description": "Roztoki Górne is a few house settle in a large valley in Bieszczady Mountains. It's also one of the darkest places in Poland you can photograph the sky, however very often foggy - especially in autumn. But if you are looking for a really good exposures it's worth visiting even if it's 6 hour car driving away from my home. This year I had a luck to have a really good weather which let me take this mosaic. \r\nIt's combined from 4 pannels of 32-36 exposures per 2 minutes each and supplemented by some frames of the middle - summary 176x2min exposures taken with modded Nikon 610 and Samyang 135/2 + 20 x 10s images for M42 core recovery.\r\nImages combined using Pix and APP and postprocessed with PS.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it.",
