    "description": "NGC1491  is an emission nebula in Perseus, also designated SH2-206 and LBN 704.  This nebula has a very low surface brightness but an extremely bright core resulting in a very broad dynamic range - and a tough one to process.  A young, blue O4 star (BD +50 Â° 886) is illuminating the nebula, although intervening gas and dust give the star a reddish appearance when photographed or viewed visually (Coe, SR 2007).  \r\n\r\nI wanted to push this to get as much of the nebula structure as possible but given the low signal strength of the HII regions, especially in the periphery of the target, I had to tolerate some serious noise.  In the end, I chose to leave the noise in favor of brighter outer regions.",
