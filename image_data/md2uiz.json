    "description": "This  super moon I took the chance to try out something new. I have seen a lot of very nice moon pics in internet in 3D technique......and to be honest, I loved them. Even they appear  somehow a little artificial, I was fascinated by the 3D look in which they appear. I read a little about how to produce them and this here is my first try.  When artificial, then with full range I thought by myself and decided for an lightly oversaturated color pic. The main idea of this 3D moon  imaging is to combine a full moon shot with partial moon shot to produce this effect. This was the most difficult part, because of course they will not fit together correctly and a lot of retouche is necessary. For this pic I took:\r\none partial moon shot\r\none full moon shot\r\nthree color full moon shots in RGB\r\none full holiday to fiddle this nonsens together.\r\nI really don't like pink very much, so my color version looks more greenish.\r\nHope you like that and of course a big excuse to the real moon photographers in this forum here\r\nCS, Christoph",
