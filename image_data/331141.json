    "description": "This object is a beautiful emission nebula, 30 light years in diameter, located 12,000 light years away in the southern constellation of Canis Major.  The object has an appropriate nickname, being a helmet-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages.  It is the result of a Wolf-Rayet star, the bright star seen near the center of the helmet, expelling its outer layers as it reaches the end of its life. The unique shape is the result of the expanding gas bubble impacting the surrounding giant molecular clouds.  The nebula is primarily a blue-green color from strong emission due to oxygen atoms in the glowing gas.  The surrounding background is reddish due to the dominant presence of hydrogen. \r\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite deep sky objects.",
