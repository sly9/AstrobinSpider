    "description": "Reworking some old data to see how much resolution can be recovered. The integrated stack has been hitting around the 1.6-1.7\" mark but in previous attempts I haven't felt that I've been able to deconvolve back enough resolution. I think I've extracted every last bit out of it now.\r\n\r\nTaken from my bortle 7 backyard so it's not an overly deep image but I'm enjoying the resolution that comes with a longer focal length telescope.",
