    "description": "NGC 6231 is an open cluster around 7 million years old. One thing that really surprised me about this, was how much Ha was hiding in the background. While I knew it was relatively close to other emission nebulae like the Prawn Nebula, to see it extend this far out was fascinating. \r\n\r\nThanks to Scott Stirling for his amazing image of it though, really inspired me to finally edit this, even though I tend to shy away from clusters. Just find this some boring. His image really showed the dynamicness of the area, and I knew I had to give it a go myself!",
