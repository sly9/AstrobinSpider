    "description": "NGC3372, also known as the Carina Nebula, is a bright, large emission nebula surrounding the star Eta Carinae, located in the southern constellation Carina.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the largest diffuse nebulae known, one that contains several open star clusters.\r\nThe Carina Nebula lies in the Carina-Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way, at a distance of between 6,500 and 10,000 light-years from Earth. \r\n\r\nNGC3372 is exceptionally large, about four times the size of the Orion Nebula (Messier 42) and spans about 460 light-years in diameter.\r\n\r\nCaptured via a remote telescope in the Rio Hurtado Valley in Chile, South America this image consists of 1hr 30 minutes of total integration using a combination of Sulphur, Hydrogen and Oxygen filters.\r\n\r\nThis was my first time processing data from a remote telescope and a fantastic opportunity to capture data using observatory grade equipment.\r\n\r\nIt might be another month or so before I get can back to imaging from the backyard but, in the meantime, having access to a remote telescope gives me the opportunity to keep capturing data and to keep sharing images.",
