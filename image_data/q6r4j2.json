    "description": "Messier 109 (also known as the Vacuum Cleaner Galaxy) is a barred spiral galaxy in Ursa Major not far from the bright star Phecda (whose reflections made it into my uncropped image). At roughly 83.5 million light years away, it is the most distant object in the Messier catalogue (beating out the second most distant object by over 20 million light years).",
