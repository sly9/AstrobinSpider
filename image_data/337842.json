    "description": "Some beautiful objects nearby the famous Seagull Nebula are often missed, here you can see the right wing of the seagull and so much more...\r\n\r\nPlease look at this link which I've used as a reference which I think you will like\r\n\r\nhttp://www.robgendlerastropics.com/IC2177-DSS-Subaru-Labels.html\r\n\r\nMy favorite feature in this image is the gas bubbles showing at center left, almost like 3D clear water bubbles. I didn't find any online references to it.\r\n\r\nSome other prominent objects to focus on;\r\n\r\n- SH2-297: A lovely red nebulosity resembling a bird (I clearly see a Hawk) at center right \r\n- SH2-295: Nice round, red nebula at the top left of the image \r\n- vdb 90: very nice blue reflection under SH2-295\r\n- LDN 1657A: Dark nebulosity above the bird (SH2-297)\r\n\r\nThanks for watching",
