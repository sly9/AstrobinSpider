    "description": "Part of the Taurus Molecular Cloud, Barnard's 7 dark nebula,\r\nImaged with a 105 f1.4 Sigma lens and ASI2600MC. I was very selective (probably too selective) only using very few of the original data set removing some of the frames with high cloud.....  So in the end the integration time was a very short 20x 300s. Just over 1,6hrs total.\r\nTo be honest I was very surprised as to how much I was able to pull out of this data set. I might even get a T-shirt printed with \"I Love Cmos\".\r\nThanks for looking\r\nPeter",
