    "description": "Waiting for some other targets to rise higher I got a nice hint from <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/JanD/\">Jan D</a> to image NGC 7129. It is nicely located within Cepheus but somehow rarely imaged so I thought I give it a \"shot\" (no pun intended) ;)\r\n\r\nIt is quite small and needed a lot of light in order to fight noise. Also seeing was not optimal the last couple of days. Anyway, I hope you like it. Let me know what you think!",
