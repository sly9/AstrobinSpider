    "description": "I have long wanted to shoot a night landscape on a telephoto lens. So much so that space is felt, and not just a night landscape against the backdrop of stars! In May, I missed this opportunity because of the weather, it is already approaching the end of June and there is still no good night. But yesterday there was good transparency, almost perfect, that made this shot possible! Yes, Scorpio gave a slight roll, but still, I liked the result.\r\n   Dust clouds of the constellation Sagittarius and Scorpio, the pearl of the night sky, unfortunatelye it is low in our latitudes. In the tail of Scorpio, reflective nebulae are visible around bright stars, Antares, Alniyat, etc. Sony A7, 135 mm, 180 s, iso 3200, 6 frames in panorama",
