    "description": "I was not interested in imaging this target really. Just did it, because of waiting to have NGC 5033 in a good position. But while the live stacking process in sharpcap I found it a very adorable object to capture. The core is really bright and even the dim halo appeared after 5 subs quite nicely.  Again I am happy about the lot of nice background galaxies all over the pic.I really love this. For this image again a cloud gap hopping was necessary to get the data in every night I captured the data and moon already began to disturb. Even I am happy with the pic, I think that there could be more\r\n H alpha signal. Maybe I will ad some, when the weather is better again. Hope you like it as it is.\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
