    "description": "This is my first attempt at processing an image in PI in over 2 years. When I first started I didn't really understand curves, the histogram, etc., so the learning curve hit me rather hard. I have pretty much used photoshop exclusively, but have felt like I have hit a wall in terms of the image quality I can extract using PS. I tried PixInsight 2 or 3 years ago, and never really had any luck, and gave up on it due to the learning curve (it seemed pretty steep and the time). Now 3 years later, I have a better fundamental knowledge of processing an astro related image, so I thought I would give PixinSight another go, and this was the result. It took me a whopping 1 hr to make a better image in PixInsight than I have in over 3 years of playing with PS. I am excited to learn more about it! I want to give a big shout out to Rogelio Bernal Andreo's new book/e-book on PI, it inspired me to give it another go and gave me a great place to start from. If you want to learn PI for the first time, I highly recommend it, it is a great way to enter the world of PixInsight. \r\nEXIF: \r\nHA Modded D750 \r\nSigma 35mm f1.4 Art @ f3.2\r\n159s ISO 1600\r\n17 images stacked in PI\r\nProcessed in PI",
