    "description": "Hi all!\r\nThis one is a further step forward in terms of data integration on my previous M27 image.\r\nI've managed and reviewed the old dataset adding new integrations acquired at the Astrocampania \"Salvetore Di Giacomo\" observatory By Antonio Catapano that gave me the raw data to edit. The new image is just a crop of the central area using all my previous dataset + this new one + some more integrations made by me under a suburban sky. Total integration time is now about 18 hours of LRGB+Ha+OIII.\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by...",
