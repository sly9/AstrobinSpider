    "description": "The IC 1396 emission nebula, also known as The Elephant's Trunk Nebula, is a concentration of bright gas and dark interstellar dust clouds. It is located in the constellation Cepheus about 2,400 light-years away from Earth. The surface of the dense cloud of interstellar dust is illuminated and ionized by a massive, bright star. The intense ultraviolet radiation it emits could still form stars through gravitational collapse. The stellar wind produced is strong enough to remove the protoplanetary disks from nearby stars.",
