    "description": "NGC 5371 (also called NGC 5390) is an 11th magnitude galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici near the Hickson 68 group.  With apparent dimensions of 4.0' x 2.5', it is appropriate for imaging at larger focal lengths.  NGC 5371 is a type SBc barred spiral, meaning it has loosely bound arms.  \r\n\r\nThis image captures the fading Supernova 2020bio, which was initially discovered in late January 2020 and reached magnitude 16 shortly thereafter.  The data for this image were acquired on  May 13, 20, and 21 of 2020, and the supernova had faded considerably.  The location of the supernova is identified in the \"B\" revision.  \r\n\r\nPart of the luminance data for this image and all of the RGB data were obtained from my back yard (Bortle 5), while the rest of the luminance subs were obtained from a good dark site (Bortle 3).",
