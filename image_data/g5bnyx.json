    "description": "Because of personal reasons and the COVID lockdown I have not been able to image as much as I would have liked it.\r\n\r\nLast 3rd April, I had a window of reasonably good seeing and enjoyed taking several craters. Here I like to share with you the best Plato area that I got from that night. Besides, processing and finding information on the features captured in the images its a not so bad way to be locked down. \r\n\r\nGood skies! Guillermo.",
