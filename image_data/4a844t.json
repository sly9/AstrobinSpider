    "description": "Crab Nebula(Messier 1)\r\nWith an apparent magnitude of 8.4 and located 6,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Taurus, the Crab Nebula is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula which was discovered and recorded by Chinese astronomer of the Song Dynasty who described it like 6 times brighter than Venus and about as brilliant as the full Moon in July of 1054. According to Song Dynasty Astronomic records, the bright source was visible during the daytime for 23 days, shining six times as brightly as Venus, and had been able to see it for 653 days with the naked eye. The crab Nebula is expanding at a rate of about 1,500 Km/s or 0.5% of the speed of light. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, an Anglo-Irish astronomer who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. \r\n\r\nResolution ............... 0.199 arcsec/px\r\nRotation ................. -68.243 deg\r\nObservation start time ... 2020-11-24 07:14:15 UTC\r\nObservation end time ..... 2020-12-11 12:09:56 UTC\r\nFocal distance ........... 1967.85 mm\r\nPixel size ............... 1.90 um\r\nField of view ............ 21' 19.8\" x 17' 59.0\"\r\nImage center .............
