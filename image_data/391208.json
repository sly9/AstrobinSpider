    "description": "TOA-150 test data before she gets migrates to the south. Personally, I am in love with this scope, but I am a total sucker for big refractors.\r\n\r\nGot inspired after seeing Ken Crawford's NGC 2023 HA filaments and did my best to bring them out in this set. While we had a few HA frames lying around, there were literally only a few and seemed to do more harm than good trying to implement them so I just had to rely on LRGB data to make them stand out. A bit tough, but nothing a little masking can't help with.",
