    "description": "This image is a combination of 15 hours of H-alpha and OIII data from last year (using a Apogee 8300 camera), plus 10 more hours of H-alpha acquired these days using a QHY600 camera. I am still collecting more data to complete a SHO image with a total of 70-80 hours. But for the time being I present this image, where I focused on the eye of the nebula, trying to bring out the cometary knots.",
