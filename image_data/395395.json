    "description": "NGC 6164 is a bipolar emission nebula spanning about 4 light years approximately 4,200 light years away and can be seen in the constellation of Norma. Although initially believed to be a planetary nebula, the shell-like nebula is now thought to have been ejected by the winds of the central supermassive O-type star (HD 148937). The central star is approximately 40 times the mass of our own sun and is expected to eventually explode as a supernova. \r\n\r\nThe picture was formed by combining individual images taken with two different filters that allow imaging of ionised Hydrogen (Ha) and Oxygen (OIII).  It was processed in PixInsight using a two-colour palette (Red = Ha, Green and Blue = OIII). It has been cropped, and drizzle integrated to a resolution of approx. 0.6 arcsec/pixel.",
