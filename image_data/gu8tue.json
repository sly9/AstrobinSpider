B = Tonemapped version\r\n\r\nData was 2x downsampled because I wasn't too happy with the star shape and sharpness at 1x1 bin.  \r\n\r\nUser <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/Arvid78/\">@Arvid Emtegren</a>Â imaged the same region 2 days after I shot these frames and he found minor planets 52 Europa and 150 Nuwa cruising past this DSO. I confirmed their position in Stellarium, they corresponded to 2 streaks in my data that were not fully removed by sigma clipping. \r\n\r\nRev. C shows the minor planets moving down in the H-alpha frames, hot pixels are moving up (due to dithering).",
