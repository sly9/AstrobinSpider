    "description": "To shoot a dark nebula during full moon and shortly after? Use an OSC camera for this? Actually not a good idea. But as so often the sky was cloudless at that time and I used it for a little experiment. According to the motto: Exposure time is everything!\r\n\r\n So I gathered a total of 30.9 hours of photons in six nights. For the single subs I chose 180 seconds each, so that the moonlight did not lead to an overexposure. Altogether the experiment was worthwhile! :-) My summary: Despite all the obstacles, the final result was surprisingly good and very deep. Exposure time pays off after all. We simply need more clear nights. :-)",
