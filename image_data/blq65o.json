    "description": "NGC 3169, NGC 3166 and NGC 3165 is interacting galaxies in Sextans.\r\nNGC 3169 (left) and NGC 3166 (right) are two spiral galaxies trapped in a death spiral. As these two galaxies begin to merge, they are starting to be pulled apart. The faint wisps surrounding NGC 3169 are its outer spiral arms being pulled off. Eventually these two galaxies will merge to form a single galaxy. NGC 3165, the small galaxy below and to the right of NGC 3166, is also a member of this group.\r\n\r\nImage captured in April 2019 from my balcony.",
