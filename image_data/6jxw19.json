    "description": "Data Credit : “Image Acquisition by the staff at Deep Sky West Remote Observatory (www.DeepSkyWest.com)”\r\n\r\nI downloaded free data on DSW website : https://www.deepskywest.com/free-downloads-v2\r\nA big thumb up to DSW for letting people get hands on top class data!\r\n\r\nMy last pit stop @ DSW data and this time it is all about an epic battle of dragons. \r\n\r\nFrom NASA : Dark shapes with bright edges winging their way through dusty NGC 6188 are tens of light-years long. The emission nebula is found near the edge of an otherwise dark and large molecular cloud in the southern constellation Ara, about 4,000 light-years away. Born in that region only a few million years ago, the massive young stars of the embedded Ara OB1 association sculpt the fantastic shapes and power the nebular glow with stellar winds and intense ultraviolet radiation. The recent star formation itself was likely triggered by winds and supernova explosions, from previous generations of massive stars, that swept up and compressed the molecular gas.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to process LRGB for this object whereas it is mainly displayed in SHO when you look for reference images. But I find that natural colors don't make a happy wedding at all\r\n\r\nUsual processing ; L on one side and RGB on the other side before LRGB combination.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll like it and don't hesitate to post a comment.",
