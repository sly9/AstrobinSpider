    "description": "On the 24th of January 2017, some user of the Liverpool Telescope decided to spend a few frames on Thor's Helmet. This is the only data on this object in the LT database and it consists of seven 120 s exposures, 3 with a Ha filter and two exposures of each of Bessell V (green) and Bessell B (blue). That is not much data but also not much work to stack, so I had a go at it. So this is a 14 min HaGB image. Thus, I put the Ha data in the red channel (since there were no red filter data), which probably explains the slightly unusual colours. All done in PS CS5.\r\n\r\nThis is of course a rather noisy image (pixel peepers should stay away) compared to the Little Dumbbell that I recently posted with 3.6 h of LT data. Still, I am slightly amazed what a big scope can collect in 14 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe scope is a 2 m RC f/10 (so 20 m focal length!) equipped with a 6 x 6 cm (15 µm pixels) 18 Mpix CCD camera (normally run at 2x2 bin) of the brand e2v, which I think is chilled to -100°C.",
