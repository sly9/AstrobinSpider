    "description": "This fascinating area of the sky is an active star forming region and part of the Perseus OB2 Molecular cloud complex.  It contains IC 348 (VdB19), the blue reflection nebula below 38 Persei (ATIK), the dark clouds Barnard 3 and 4, and the emission nebula area LBN 749 behind the dust.  Several Herbig-Haro objects are below IC 348 and several other reflection  and dark nebula along with a few small galaxies.   Dust fills this area and only a small portion near the upper right is dust free.  The image was taken from November 2020 into early January 2021 from my Bortle 5 backyard.  It consists of 23.85hrs of exposure time through LRGB and Ha filters.",
