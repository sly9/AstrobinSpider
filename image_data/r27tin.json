    "description": "I was never satisfied with my Bubble Nebula, even after an untold number of processing attempts.  For this version, I decided this orientation evokes a \"bubble\" more characteristically than a side orientation.  Not much else to say, except I used less noise control (almost none), I more tightly controlled sharpening, and brought down the saturation a bit.  This is a center crop to showcase the bubble, while keeping much of the background nebula visible, though toned down a bit.  I feel like I just removed an aggravating pebble from my shoe that I could not find.  Ahhhhh...nice.  Probably room for improvement, but  for now, I will be content.  That didn't last long...I would like to improve the surrounding nebula.  In the Ha stack, even the dark regions have faint nebulosity--I always loose signal upon channel combination.  But that is a project for some future date.....I'll clear my schedule for tomorrow! The next time I image this beauty, it will be with a longer focal length, bigger aperture scope.",
