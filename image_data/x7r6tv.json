    "description": "Head for Deneb, the tail of the Swan. You may be tempted to turn slightly to the East and stop at the beatiful North America and Pelican nebulas. But if you turn West instead, you may be surprised by a huge, lurking deep red dragon. \r\n\r\nA number of HII regions shape this nebulosity, many of them listed in the Lynds Bright Nebula catalog, with some omissions, notably the \"Propeller Nebula\" (Simeis 57, DWB 111), located near the center of the image. \r\n\r\nFinal version has been processed with drizzle algorithm (2x) to improve spatial resolution. \r\n\r\nThis image has been featured as <a href=\"https://www.aapod2.com/blog/vfgspmhjz4wx79aucux6ifexs56fwr\">Amateur Astronomy Picture of the Day (AAPOD) on Nov 27th, 2020</a>. \r\n\r\n200mm, f/4\r\nHa: 24x 600s (15-16/08/2020, from Sevilla city)\r\nL: 14x 300s (19-20/08/2020, from Hornachos)\r\nR: 10x 300s (19/08/2020, from Hornachos)\r\nG: 10x 300s (19/08/2020, from Hornachos)\r\nB: 10x 300s (19/08/2020, from Hornachos)",
