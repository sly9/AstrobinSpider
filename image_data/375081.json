    "description": "After seeing the amazing NGC 474 published by Lorenzo Siciliano, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. So I decided to alter my November schedule to focus on this one object.\r\n\r\nSo far, every night has had high wispy clouds. I planned to gather 12 hours of L and 2 hours of each RGB with no clouds. What you see here is only 4.5 hours of L and 2 hours of each RGB all through wispy clouds. I plan to image this object for another week to see if I can get better data. Until then, I hope you enjoy this work in progress.\r\n\r\nWhat a surprise to see another similar \"shell\" object, NGC 467, in this wider field!\r\n\r\n***Reprocessed from additional data captured in clear 21.4 SQM skies on 11/5, 11/6 and 11/7. 10 hours L and approximately 4 hours of each RGB.***\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Scientists have demonstrated through computer modelling that interacting or merging galaxies can produce multiple shells in concentric layers. NGC 474 is a distant elliptical galaxy exhibiting just such an pattern. By chance, a second shell-type galaxy is present in the upper left corner of this field (NGC 467).\"",
