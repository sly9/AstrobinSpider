    "description": "Being in the northern hemisphere I can only dream about shooting the Vela supernova remnant but I thought of trying something similar so SH2-240 (Spaghetti supernova remnant) is the closest I could find during this time of the year. The target is getting quite low and I was hoping to add more Oiii to it but it looks like this will be it for this year.\r\nI hope you like it.",
