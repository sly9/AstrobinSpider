    "description": "A wonderfully complex star forming region located in the constellation of Corona Australis (the 'Southern Crown') approximately 500 light years distant. There is a lot going in in this image with a prominent globular cluster (NGC6723), blue reflection nebulae, red/pink emission nebulae, Herbig-Haro objects, dark clouds of red/brown dust and a nice variation of star colours from red (cool) stars to blue/white (very hot) stars. There are two Herbig-Haro objects in the centre of the image, one is the small red semi circular shaped object and the other is the small area of red nebulosity just above it. Scrolling around the image also reveals a number of background galaxies.",
