    "description": "Interesting fact: the variable nebula next to PV Cephei (seen on the upper left of the frame, also known as known as GM 1-29 or Gyulbudaghianâ€™s Nebula) is very dim as of October of this year. \r\n\r\nIts shape and brightness is changing with the time period of just a few months. The best image of the nebula can probably be seen in the Hubble shot here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/pv-cep.html\r\n\r\nI added a zoom into the region of interest. The bigger red circle is highlighting what now is the dim nebulosity. It is marked HH215 which is the name of the associated Harbig-Haro object. There are multiple additional Harbig-Haro objects in the field. I marked them with red circles as well but did not bother to put labels.",
