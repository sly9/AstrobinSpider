    "description": "The Moon Center Trio\r\nMost people believe that the moon is, well, a simple moon, but some people say that in reality, the satellite should be classified as a planet. The main reason for this is the size of the celestial body, which although it is about a quarter of the Earth's diameter, is by far the largest natural satellite compared to its planet in our Solar System.\r\nBecause of its large size, the Moon does not orbit Earth itself. In fact, both bodies rotate around each other, concentrating on a point between the two (called the barycenter). As this region is located in the earth's crust, we have the illusion that the \"satellite\" surrounds us. The fact that the barycentre is inside our planet is the only element that prevents the classification of both as twin planets.\r\nSource: Megacurioso",
