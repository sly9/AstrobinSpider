    "description": "Processing this one was absolutely brutal. I’ve been sitting on these data for over a month because my first two attempts looked absolutely terrible. I just couldn’t get the colors to work at all. I finally gave it another shot last Friday and I’ve been working on it ever since. For the purists: You should know I masked and pasted the crap out of this because once I finally got the stars, background and M82 to look nice, M81 looked downright ugly. So I tried just processing M81 and once I got it looking how I wanted, M82 had been completely destroyed. I definitely feel like this is my most ‘overprocessed’ image, and I still managed to blow out the core of M81. Special thanks to Jeremy Scheere, Cameron Jack, Samara Nagle, Brian Fulda, Jarrett Trezzo and Elie Kheirallah for input on this one!\r\n\r\nFYI: Despite the integration time, there was no trace of IFN even in my superlum stack. Bortle 7-8 skies are apparently just too bright to capture it.",
