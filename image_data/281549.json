    "description": "Because of worsening seeing conditions I stopped my main target session and switched to comet Johnson. The main Johnson season is still to come, but a few test shots are always a good idea.\r\nAfter a few subs, I recognized another, smaller object moving in the background. Here you see 2h of data. I don't know what this object may be. It looks fuzzy and dim, so it probably isn't a minor planet. Maybe an comet ?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe feedback from the AB community motivated me to add another revision. \r\nRevision C  contains a stabilized image and 3 additional frames.  Saddly, no more frames are available.\r\n",
