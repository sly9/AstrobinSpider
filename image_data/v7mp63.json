    "description": "NGC 2261 (also called Hubbleâ€™s Variable Nebula) is a reflection nebula located in the constellation Monoceros. The nebula is illuminated by the giant B0 star R Monocerotis (R Mon). This star cannot be seen directly but is hidden in the nebula.\r\n\r\nThe nebula presents rapid changes to its shape and internal structures. Hence, pictures from different years will deviate from each other. The reason for this is most likely not a substantial change to the nebula itself but rather small variations of the matter close to the light source R Mon, which cast shadows onto the more distant areas of reflection matter.\r\n\r\nRight above NGC 2261, a faint but clearly red object can be glimpsed. This is the Herbig-Haro object HH 39. The dark starless area in the upper left corner of the image is LBN 922.",
