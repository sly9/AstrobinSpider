    "description": "IC1311 is an open cluster visible in the northern part of Cygnus constellation, near the nebular complex of IC1318. \r\nIt has a diameter of 5 ', magnitude 13 and contains about sixty stars. \r\nThe cluster seems to be enclosed by a group of bright stars and is immersed in an area rich in nebulosity. \r\nI started with the idea of doing only RGB, but seeing then the background nebulosity I opted to do also some poses in Ha which I then added to channel R. \r\nNear the upper edge of the image, towards the left, it is visible a small round planetary nebula, Patchick 6, discovered by Dana Patchick of the Deep Sky Hunter team, a group of researchers who seeks to find \"unidentified\" objects in the archives of the Digital Sky Survey.\r\n\r\nwww.robertomarinoni.com",
