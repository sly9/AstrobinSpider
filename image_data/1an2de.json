    "description": "Hot, young stars and cosmic pillars of gas and dust seem to crowd into NGC 7822. At the edge of a giant molecular cloud toward the northern constellation Cepheus, the glowing star forming region lies about 3,000 light-years away.  The image includes data from Narrowband filters, mapping emission from atomic oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur into blue, green, and red hues. . This field spans around 40 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 7822.",
