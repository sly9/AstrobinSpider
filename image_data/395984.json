    "description": "Gum 1 is the smaller companion to IC 2177, the Seagull Nebula. This is the first target test for my 8RC and an ASI ZWO 1600MM; the scope is reduced ~.74x with the CCDT67 by Astro=Physics.  I am reasonably happy with both the FOV and the image quality; needs some additional noise reduction. At this FOV you can begin to see details of the nebula, especially its wispy nature. And the lightning strike dark lane is quite prominent.",
