    "description": "My first version of this galaxy pair was taken during a short 4 hour clearing with 5-min luminance subs at -20C...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/407327/B/\">First version, 3.4 hours integration</a>\r\n\r\nNow with skies clearing and a marine layer yielding 21.7+ SQM skies, I had a chance to revisit with longer 15-min subs at -30C. I was hoping to expose the very faint tidal stream that Mark Hanson found using a CDK24 at the Stellar Winds Observatory in Animas, New Mexico. His inverted image (inset) is LRGB at 5.75. 3.25, 3.25 and 3.5 hours respectively.\r\n\r\nOn a good quality monitor with the brightess turned up, you can see this very faint tidal stream in my slightly shorter exposure. I suspect Mark has an even darker sky with greater transparency. I'm shooting at 4,200' with 80% humidity. He's at 4,406'with likely much lower humidity.\r\n\r\nThe glow on the left side is from a very bright star that didn't quite make it into the frame.\r\n\r\nAs always, I look forward to your comments!",
