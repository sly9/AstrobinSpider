    "description": "This target makes for a very interesting challenge in LRGB. I had difficulties getting decent contrast between the dark dust and the massive amounts of Ha. In the end after beating on it a few times I finally got something that I was happy with. It is hard to believe that there is no Ha data in this image with all the red gas around. I am a big fan of reflection nebulas and there are a few in here. Overall I am happy with how this one turned out. I would have liked to bring out some more details in the dark dust but I think it is just the limits of my skies and gear. When I upgrade to a bigger scope I might come back to this on a few nights of good seeing and try to get more out of it.",
