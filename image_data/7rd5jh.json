    "description": "NGC 2392, also known as the Eskimo Planetary Nebula, was rather hard to process for me being as small as it is at 48″ × 48″. Also being as bright as it is, I had to combine three different histogram stretches and layer them in together to make it appealing and uniform. I then added in an hour each of RGB for the stars. \r\n\r\nThe Eskimo Nebula is a bipolar planetary nebula located in Gemini constellation. It is sometimes also known as the Clown Face Nebula. It got the nickname Eskimo because its shape resembles a head wearing a fur-lined parka hood.\r\n\r\nWith an apparent magnitude of 10.1, the nebula is invisible to the naked eye, but can be seen in a small telescope. It is, however, best viewed with a larger telescope, which reveals some of the nebula’s details.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo Nebula lies at a distance of over 2,870 light years from Earth. It was created roughly 10,000 years ago, when a Sun-like star used up all the hydrogen at its core, started to cool and expand, growing by tens to hundreds of times its original size, and eventually expelled its outer layers to form the planetary nebula. The central star will eventually collapse and become a white dwarf.",
