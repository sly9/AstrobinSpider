    "description": "We have lived to see an important event in the field of astrophotography. For the first time in over a good few years we can see a wonderful comet with our own eyes. Therefore, the current week is very hot for all astrophotographers, it is worth emphasizing that it is also visible to the naked eye all night. I recommend spending a bit of the night to see her beautiful braid. Kometa is located to the north at the height of the bright Kapella Star in the constellation Woźnica. Its phenomenon is two visible braids - dust and gas.\r\n\r\nPicture taken on Sunday evening on the Bug in Kuligów, Mazovia, POLAND 12.07.2020 \r\nCanon 6D plus Sigma 105mm f1.4 ART @ f1.8 2s",
