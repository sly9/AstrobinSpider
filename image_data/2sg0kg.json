    "description": "Hi friends.\r\n\r\nWow, what spring, it seemed like it would never come. But at last the sun shines and the clouds begin to disappear, a month and a half ago.\r\nThese data are from April / May of last year.\r\nI admit that I did not like the result too much for such a huge work, the data was good but the mosaic was poorly planned and joining the areas was very difficult, aligning them was even worse, in my first attempt I could not completely match the different areas. \r\nhttps://astrob.in/3rhg7l/E/\r\n\r\nSince then I wanted to solve this, I recognize that I was very lazy, so these weeks of rain gave me the opportunity to do this with the necessary tranquility, I wanted to expand the field with respect to my previous attempt to include the NGC-6881 nebula, I resigned to RGB data forcing me to crop.\r\nI did a first version without stars, this deteriorated some areas and as Uwe says, \"something is missing\".\r\nFinally I added the stars, better without a doubt.\r\nI hope you like it and let me know your impressions, good and bad.\r\n\r\nGreetings friends, take care and enjoy.",
