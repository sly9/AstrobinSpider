    "description": "I have previously posted a version of the Heart Nebula taken at Les Granges that involved data we collected added to previous data that Olly Penrice had http://www.astrobin.com/272267/?nc=user.  I thought I would have a go, however, at processing just the data we collected over two nights there.  That meant less to crop and so I could retain my original framing.  I was able to retain a little more of the Soul nebula, for example.  It also meant less data, of course.   ",
