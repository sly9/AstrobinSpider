    "description": "This is M16 captured from ICAstronomy in Oria, Spain. \r\nThe image was captured using a narrowband Hydrogen-alpha filter (Ha) as the moon was at about 70% this was a test of my new Ha filter.\r\n\r\nAlso in the image is the famous Pillars of Creation.\r\n\r\nHa 10x1800 Secs\r\n\r\n5 Hours in total.\r\n\r\nThe Eagle Nebula is part of a diffuse emission nebula, or H II region, which is catalogued as IC 4703. This region of active current star formation is about 7000 light-years distant. A spire of gas that can be seen coming off the nebula in the northeastern part is approximately 9.5 light-years or about 90 trillion kilometers long.\r\n\r\nEquipment used:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Tec 140 F7\r\n\r\nCamera: Xpress Trius SX-694 Mono Cooled to -15C\r\n\r\nImage Scale: 0.95 \r\n\r\nGuiding: OAG\r\n\r\nFilters: Astronomik Ha 6nm\r\n\r\nMount: iOptron CEM60 \"Standard\" GOTO Centre Balanced Equatorial Mount\r\n\r\nImage Acquisition: Sequence Generator Pro\r\n\r\nStacking and Calibrating: Pixinsight\r\n\r\nProcessing: Pixinsight 1.8, Photoshop CC",
