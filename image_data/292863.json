    "description": "This target is challenging from my location as it transits at an elevation of only 31° and doesn't stay above the horizon very long, but I decided to give it a shot because I thought I could probably do better than last year's effort and it's a lot of fun to try and image the tidal tails. Everything was working about as well as could be expected, but I did miscalculate what time the target would set so I got only 6 R subs, many fewer than I was aiming for, and in general I struggled from not having quite enough data. The L data were noisier than expected. I may want to try either using a bit longer subs or going back to unity gain. But I do think this is better than I got last year. \r\n\r\nDate: 21 Apr 2017\r\nSubject: NGC 4038/4039, Antennae Galaxies\r\nScope: AT8IN + High Point Scientific coma corrector\r\nFilters: ZWO 31 mm diameter unmounted L, R, G, B\r\nMount: EQ-6 (EQMOD 2.000j)+PEC\r\nGuiding: Orion Thin Off-axis Guider + DSI +PHD 2.6.3.2 (Win 10 ASCOM) using predictive PEC algorithm\r\nCamera: ASI1600MM-Cool, -20 °C, Gain 0 Offset 10 \r\nAcquisition: Sequence Generator Pro 2.6.0.21\r\nExposure: 50x180 L, 6x180 R, 15x180 G, 15x180 B\r\nStacking: Neb 4.1.5, flats & darks, trans+rot align, Nebulosity 1.5σ stack and align.\r\nProcessing: StarTools 1.4.327. Stretched and deconvoluted the luminance. Combined RGB in Neb 4 and stretched,  color balanced, and sharpened in StarTools. Layered luminance over RGB in Photoshop CC 2014, used Carboni’s Astronomy Tools deep space noise reduction several times, boosted the vibrance a lot and saturation almost as much, used fairly aggressive unsharp mask to make up for less aggressive deconvolution in StarTools, topped off with AstroFrame.",
