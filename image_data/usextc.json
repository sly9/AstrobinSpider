    "description": "NGC 1365 is a barred spiral galaxy in Fornax. It is the most prominent galaxy in Fornax, and arguably the most prominent barred spiral in the sky.\r\n\r\nAt the core of NGC 1365 lies a supermassive black hole. Astronomers think NGC 1365's prominent bar plays a crucial role in the galaxy's evolution, drawing gas and dust into a star-forming maelstrom, and ultimately feeding material into the central black hole. Our own Milky Way Galaxy is thought to have a bar, but perhaps not so prominent as the one in NGC 1365.\r\n\r\nSupernovae 2001du, 1983V, and 1957C were observed in NGC 1365 (not shown).",
