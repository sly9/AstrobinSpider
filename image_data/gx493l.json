    "description": "Just a short hop from the well-known and frequently imaged Heart and Soul Nebulae (IC 1805 and IC 1848 respectively), is a third lesser known large emission nebulae, known as Sh2-202. Most of it occupies the right half of this image, but it does extend slightly beyond the framing. Bordering it on the left are the reflection nebulae vdB 14 and vdB 15. These objects create a lovely contrasting field with scattered dark nebulae and the open star cluster Stock 23 in the upper right corner. vdB 14 is purely a reflection nebula on the top left quadrant of the image, illuminated by the star HD 21291. vdB 15 is below it and is a reflection nebula illuminated by the star HD 21389 but it also contains some red emission nebulae, which give the pinkish hues to certain areas.",
