    "description": "This faint tiny object is a pair of disturbed interacting galaxies located 300 million light years away in the constellation of Hydra.\r\n\r\nThe image looks like a peaceful image of a penguin guarding its egg, but is really a violent collision and merger between two galaxies. The larger galaxy on the right (NGC 2936, the Penguin) is a disturbed and severely distorted spiral galaxy.  The core of the galaxy is yellow, while the distorted arms contain bluish star clusters and at least one faintly reddish region indicating star formation.  It is appropriate that the brightest blue star cluster is at the end of the Penguin's beak.\r\n\r\nThe elliptical galaxy companion (NGC 2937, the Egg) is at lower left. The stars of this companion galaxy have not been affected as much by the interaction because it was originally in a spherically shape.  The entire galaxy contains yellow stars, which is typical of these older elliptical galaxies. \r\n\r\nStudying the image closely, I like the faint tidal star streams which flow from and to each of the galaxies.  The two most evident ones are up from the top of the elliptical galaxy, and down to the lower right from the spiral galaxy.\r\n\r\nSlightly above and to the right of the pair, an unrelated bluish galaxy (PGC 1237172) appears to be an elongated edge-on spiral. This galaxy is only 70% of the distance of the pair from us and is not physically related to them. It just happens to lie along the same line of sight in the foreground.  Several other distant faint galaxies are also visible in the image.",
