    "description": "You don't hear this complaint often, Eight mornings in a row of \"as good as it gets\" (for here) seeing to the horizon.  This is my first processed image of the comet.  I have days upon days of data yet to be processed on a slow computer.  \r\n\r\nThe complaint? Sleep and unfinished work.   Tomorrow morning looks good also!\r\n\r\nNEOWISE never gets higher than 10 degrees here.  The moon has been ever present.\r\n\r\nBut this comet has been breath taking every morning!  Spectacular! A moment to cherish! A true sky splendor!  But you already know this.\r\n\r\nGreat shooting to everyone!",
