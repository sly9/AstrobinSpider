    "description": "Can you see him? The Smoking man form the x-Files!\r\nThere he is in profile lurking at bottom left of frame. Heâ€™s surrounded by thin whisps of smoke & mist in this remote corner of NGC 3372. \r\n\r\nFeeling relieved that I've finally got the Tak 130 & 6162 camera just about aligned 100% after dealing with a nightmare of tilt & eccentricity errors in manufacturing, mainly in the focuser. \r\n\r\nPixel peepers will notice a tiny bit of distortion on the stars at the very bottom right of the frame - man these full frame camera sensors are demanding! \r\nThe big Feathertouch focuser is very nice, but sadly this one was out of square on almost every surface by up to 100 microns in all different directions. Anyway, it's all re-machined now thanks to a colleague astrophotographer with a precise lathe, to within 10 microns and the difference is huge! \r\n\r\nHa, O3, S2, RGB\r\nChroma Filters\r\nFrom my Backyard in Melbourne, Australia.",
