    "description": "Sharpless Sh2-15\r\n\r\nI spotted this region on Galaxy map & not having seen images of this nebula, I thought it might make an interesting target. (Post production research unearthed two published images, one here on AB by by Gary Imm & another on the Sharpless catalogue site by Dean Salman.)\r\n\r\nThe region is ionised by the star HD 161853, the brightest white star at the top of the image. In the centre is an interesting band of dust silhouetted against the Ha region. \r\nThe object is a Ha region located 5000 light years away in Scorpius, it's also known as RCW 134 and Gum 69.\r\n\r\nTwo star clusters are visible in the image. NGC 6425, a bright colourful open cluster of 25 stars located 2500 light years away, in the top left corner. Pixel peepers and 'Where’s Wally' fans should try to spot Terzan 6 - visible as a tiny faint orange smudge on the right hand side of the image around 3 o'clock. (Look just below right of the small dust cloud.)  This globular cluster is 25,000 light years away!\r\n\r\n10x180 sec R,G&B\r\n24x 300 sec LUM\r\n12x 1200 sec 5nm Ha\r\n\r\nTaken from my light polluted suburban backyard in 'Lockdown Central’ - Melbourne, Australia.",
