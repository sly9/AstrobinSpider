    "description": "The subframes were captured over 18 nights from April 28th to June 4th. \r\nThe data set consists of the following:\r\n\r\nL = 15 x 600s\r\nR = 15 x 600s\r\nG = 10 x 600s\r\nB = 10 x 600s\r\nHa = 40 x 1800s\r\nOIII = 40 x 1800s\r\n\r\nThe data was combined as LRGB and HOO\r\n\r\nI don't think I really needed all that Ha data. There doesn't appear to be that much Ha present in the nebula. The OIII on the other hand revealed a nice outer band beyond the core of the nebula.\r\n I tried a couple of new pixinsight tools this time that I hadn't used before, notably the NormalizeScaleGradient script and GradientHDRCompression. Both tools proved to be an improvement over my usual processing flow.",
