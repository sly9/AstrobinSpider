    "description": "A widefield image of NGC 7822, a star-forming region in the constellation Cepheus.  Shot in narrowband SHO, with a palette where RGB = 0.60Sii + 0.40Ha : .30sii + 0.30Ha + 0.40Oiii : 100Oiii. Acquired with an AT80EDT reduced by 0.8x, unguided, on a Paramount MyT using Voyager.  It took six nights with 430 180s subs kept for the final integration of 21.5 hours. The camera was the ZWO ASI 1600MM Pro cooled to -10C with Astronomik filters. My SQM reading was 18.5-18.6.  September 28 - October 4, 2020.",
