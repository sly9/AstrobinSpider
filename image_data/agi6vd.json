The bright core is is full of clouds of gas and dust, and there are numerous H Alpha star forming regions, and young blue star clusters. \nImaged in LRGB and H Alpha on our  RiDK 400 at El Sauce, Obstech, Chile.\n\nSystem Control Software:  Voyager  by Leonardo Orazi\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\nChile Team: Mike Selby , Stefan Schmidt, Leo Orazi, John Kasianowicz, Scott Johnson, Josh Balsam, Rick Stevenson",
