    "description": "Comet C/2020 M3 Atlas in emerald green color passes by the main colorful nebula of the Constellation Auriga in this image captured and processed from Grand Mesa Observatory on 12/8/2020 by Terry Hancock and Tom Masterson. This image was captured using QHYCCD’s latest offering the QHY410C Back Illuminated Full Frame one shot color CMOS camera that we have the honor of testing. \r\n\r\nThe main nebulae in this image are the Flaming Star Nebula (IC 405) the comma shaped red and white/purple nebula to the top and right along with the Tadpole Nebula (NGC 1893) located to the center left. Comet C/2020 M3 Atlas is seen almost ‘touching’ the Tadpole Nebula in this image. Distance-wise Comet C/2020 M3 Atlas was a mere 3.74 light-minutes from Earth when this image was captured while the Flaming Star Nebula is about 1,400 light-years distant and further still is the Tadpole Nebula which is roughly 12,400 light-years away. \r\n\r\nTechnical Info:\r\nTotal Integration time 3.3 hours\r\nLocation: GrandMesaObservatory.com Purdy Mesa, Colorado\r\nDate of capture: December 9th, 2020\r\nColor RGGB 200 min, 100 x 120 sec\r\nCamera: QHY410C Back Illuminated Full Frame Color CMOS\r\nGain 0, Offset 76\r\nRead Mode: High Gain Mode\r\nCalibrated with Dark, Bias and Flat Frames\r\nOptics: Takahashi E-180 Astrograph\r\nImage Acquisition software Maxim DL6\r\nPre-Processed in Pixinsight\r\nPost Processed in Photoshop",
