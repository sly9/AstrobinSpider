    "description": "This is a closer field, re-processed, view of the Wizard Nebula I previously posted. Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nHA,OIII,RGB - 8.5 Hours Integration.\r\n\r\nLocated 7200 light years away, the Wizard nebula, surrounds developing open star cluster NGC 7380. Visually, the interplay of stars, gas, and dust has created a shape that appears to some like a fictional medieval sorcerer. The active star forming region spans 100 about light years, making it appear larger than the angular extent of the Moon. The Wizard Nebula can be located with a small telescope toward the constellation of the King of Aethiopia (Cepheus). Although the nebula may last only a few million years, some of the stars being formed may outlive our Sun.",
