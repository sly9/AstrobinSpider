    "description": "Since I started with astrophotography a year ago I didn't have a chance to shoot a proper RGB image, (living under Bortle 9 skies in BsAs city I am limited to mostly narrowband).  \r\nYesterday my astro-friend <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/cappellettiariel/\">Ariel Cappelletti</a> asked me to process his NGC6744 data; acquired recently  with an almost exact same setup as mine, under darker rural skies. I love the result!\r\n\r\nThis is my second attempt at processing a galaxy. \r\nThanks Ari for sharing the beautiful data!\r\n\r\nClear skies everyone!",
