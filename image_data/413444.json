    "description": "I could not resit a try to shoot this huge galaxy cluster after seeing an image from a 16'' dosbon with luckystrike processing of my friend Olivier B.\r\n\r\nThe Hercules Cluster (Abell 2151) is a cluster of about 200 galaxies some 500 million light-years distant in the constellation Hercules. It is rich in spiral galaxies and shows many interacting galaxies. The cluster is part of the larger Hercules Supercluster, which is itself part of the much larger Great Wall super-structur (wiki)\r\n\r\nThe cluster's brightest member is the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 6041.\r\n\r\n115 Light subs @180s gain zero and -20째C and\r\n\r\n15 Blue subs @180s gain zero and -20째C\r\n15 Green subs @180s gain zero and -20째C\r\n15 Red subs @180s gain zero and -20째C\r\n\r\n5 nights were necessary to get the subs: 18 , 23 , 25/26 , 27/28 , 26/27 of June",
