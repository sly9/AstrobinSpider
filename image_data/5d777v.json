    "description": "IC 4603 is part of the Rho Ophiuchus Nebula Complex. \r\nDense dust clouds to the upper left are opaque to visible light and completely hide background stars.This image was framed to show that affect, as stars peer out through less dense nebula along the top edge of the image.\r\n\r\nThe bright star is 7.9 magnitude SAO184376 which is the main source of light for this cool blue reflection nebula. The contrasting warmer-redish areas towards left are due in part to light reflected from the nearby Antares, a red giant. Antares lies to the left-south and outside the field of view.\r\n\r\nThis image was taken over 7 nights starting April 4, 2021",
