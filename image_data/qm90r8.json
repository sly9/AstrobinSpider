    "description": "This image is a 2 panel mosaic, however I cropped the left side significantly because the image was so wide and there really wasn't much going on over there.  I am in love with the structures in the central part of the nebula.  I tried to bring out the details in the core of the nebula and in Thackeray's Globules.  Since we had both RGB and Narrow Band data, I decided to mix in a bit of the color from the RGB, as well as put in the RGB stars.  \r\n\r\nAnd...for the record.  I have never seen a \"running chicken\" in any of the images of this beautiful nebula that I have seen.\r\n\r\nI hope you like the results...",
