    "description": "I processed this a couple months back in the traditional Hubble Palette. I am often on the fence whether I like the traditional Hubble Palette or something more natural. Sense I live in a Red Zone, narrowband often levels the playing field for me, but often gives me limited options. A few months ago I did some experimenting and discovered a way to create a more natural look out of Ha and OIII in Photoshop. I combine the two first, then create a synthetic green channel and finally mask in additional OIII data. There are several other steps of course, but that is pretty much the simplified process.\r\n\r\nSharpless 132 is a faint emission nebula at the Cepheus/Lacerta border, it measures 42 x 30 arcminutes. It lies about a degree southeast of Îµ Cep. It can be glimpsed visually, but that takes a rich-field refractor and very dark skies. Sh2-132 lies in the field of the Cepheus OB1 association. It is related to Cep OB1, whose distance is given as 10,000 to 12,000 light-years, thus it is located in the Perseus arm of our Galaxy, and measures more than 250 light years in extent. Some photographers call it \"The Lion Nebula\" due to its shape (head upper left, tail to the right, four legs below). It features a conspicuous dark lane in the \"head\" section.",
