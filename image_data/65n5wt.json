    "description": "I did an experiment with this target, accidentally.\r\n\r\nA mistake in my ending time for this caused by rig to continue taking images until this target got down to 0 degrees.  For the main image I only used subs down to 20 degrees.  Version C is the set of 34 images at elevations between 12 and 16, averaging 14 degrees.  Lowest target I have ever imaged.  Just curious what might result.  Actually a lot better than I expected.  Clearly not nearly as good as the main image, but part of that is it only had 34 frames versus 238.\r\n\r\nWikipedia:\r\nIC 2177 is a region of nebulosity that lies along the border between the constellations Monoceros and Canis Major. It is a roughly circular H II region centered on the Be star HD 53367. This nebula was discovered by Welsh amateur astronomer Isaac Roberts and was described by him as \"pretty bright, extremely large, irregularly round, very diffuse.\"\r\n\r\nThe name Seagull Nebula is sometimes applied by amateur astronomers to this emission region, although it more properly includes the neighboring regions of star clusters, dust clouds and reflection nebulae. This latter region includes the open clusters NGC 2335 and NGC 2343.\r\n\r\nNGC 2327 is located in IC2177. It is also known as the Seagull's Head, due to its larger presence in the Seagull nebula.\r\n\r\nMy Collections:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae (70 of 79)</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2627/\" target=\"_new\">Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2626/\" target=\"_new\">Galaxies</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2625/\" target=\"_new\">Sharpless 2 Objects</a>",
