    "description": "On the same evening as I captured Venus in IR and UV, I was also pleased to see the considerable detail coming across in the Blue-Violet part of the spectrum. This false colour image is then \"spectrum shifted\" to the shorter wavelength end of the spectrum with Blue mapped to Red, Violet to Green and UV to Blue. This false colour approach is less contrived than the IR_UV false colour convention, in that it just moves a part of the spectrum (Blue, Violet, Ultraviolet) across to the visible spectrum. \r\nI use a Luminance filter in line with the Wratten #47 Violet filter to block the IR leakage. It would be better to use an IR block filter in series as I am probably losing some of the shorter wavelength end of the Violet filter. Any recommendations most welcome.\r\nIt is interesting that the Violet image is more like the Blue image than the UV one, whereas in the past I have seen the Violet and UV images being more similar. I don't know why.\r\nThe mouse over shows a contrast enhanced visible light image, where subtle banding can be seen.",
