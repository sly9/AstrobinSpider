    "description": "This is the first light with a new camera, a QHY600. Will add details of the acquisition later on, but in a nutshell, it's a 14.5 hr integration. Had an issue with roughly half the series, as somehow the parameters of the camera changed (gain, offset, mode) without me noticing (maybe the ASCOM driver did it in a reconnect), and since such parameters are not save in the FITS header, I could not properly calibrate that batch. It will take a few session to know this camera well, but I like very much what I have seen so far (regardless of the parameters mishap).",
