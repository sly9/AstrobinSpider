    "description": "The Elephant Trunk Nebula is a sinuous pillar of glowing gas and dust within a larger, circular region of nebulosity. The overall structure reminds me a little of the Rosette Nebula (NGC 2238). It can be found just north of Herschel's famous Garnet Star, a luminous red supergiant, in the constellation Cepheus. HR 8281â€”the hot, massive star near the center of the imageâ€”is ionizing the gas in the entire region and is responsible for sculpting the elephant trunk itself. \r\n\r\nWhile collecting data for this image, my area was experiencing a heat wave and the sky was filled with the smoke of numerous fires burning in Southern California. Transparency was terrible. That's not an excuse, butâ€¦okay, it's an excuse. ðŸ˜‰",
