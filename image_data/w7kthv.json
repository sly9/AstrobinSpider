    "description": "NEW DISCOVERY: Strottner-Drechsler 98 - The Opal Nebula\r\nStDr98 is a potential planetary nebula in the constellation of Cassiopeia at a distance of approximately 965 light years from Earth. StDr98 was discovered by Xavier Strottner and Marcel Drechsler in early 2020.\r\nEverything is double at StDr98, thats no exaggeration, because in this photo another PN candidate is hidden in the photo! On the right above StDr98 there is - surprise - StDr97, another discovery by Xavier and Marcel.\r\nOne of the most interesting aspects of StDr98 is probably not its magnificent appearance with the two huge arcs and the blue centre that reminds of a gemstone. Almost even more exciting is its centre, which is not (as usual) formed by a white dwarf star, but by two white dwarfs. A binary system of two white dwarfs in the centre of a planetary nebula is extremely rare.\r\n* * *\r\nStDr 98 / PN-G: 110.0-04.6\r\nCoordinates: 23:17:57.63 +55:50:27.03\r\nDiameter: approx. 20 minutes of arc\r\nStDr 97 / PN-G: 109.5-04.3\r\nCoordinates: 23:14:18.82 +55:59:33.90\r\nDiameter: approx. 1.1 minutes of arc\r\n* * * \r\n\r\nAndreas Zirke\r\n\r\nExposure \r\nHa3nm 106x15min, Ha7nm 75x15min, SII3nm 59x15min, OIII 167x10min, R 56x5min, G 52x5min, B 52x5min\r\n\r\n102h!!!\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n3x Takahashi Epsilon 130D, 3x Atik one 9.0, Astrodon RGB filter, Astrodon 3nm narrowband.
