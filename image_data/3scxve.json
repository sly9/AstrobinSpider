    "description": "A combination of the image with the Vixen R200SS and the Takahashi Sky90. Only 2x seven lights were used. The different filters give interesting differences in the blue stars. The IDAS D2 filters more blue light. The two images can be found here\r\nSky90: https://astrob.in/v340vi/0/\r\nR200SS: https://astrob.in/kjpw87/0/\r\n\r\nThe two series of frames were calibrated and debayered with flats and bias images of each series. Then all 14 frames were drizzle integrated with a distortion correction, which was necessary at the corners. Drizzle integration brought better resolution than the two separet images. It was necessary to take care of the different orientations of the two series of images.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it. Let me know what you think.\r\nCS\r\nUlli",
