    "description": "Mars was well placed this morning to allow me make 3 RGB runs of 4 minutes duration per colour channel. It is still only 6 arc seconds n apparent diameter which limits the resolution, but being higher in the morning sky benefits the seeing and therefore what can be discerned on the planet's surface.\r\nThis view shows the 89% illuminated planet, with Syrtis Major of course the major feature visible at the central meridian. On its p side there is an interesting bright area. The resolution is not quite good enough to work out what is going on with the Hellas Basin, but there seems to be a ‘V’ shaped light coloured band extended up from it towards Syrtis Major. This may be an indication of some dust activity. There is also a white feature extended up from the South Polar Cap, towards the Hellas Basin. It is a slightly darker colour compared to the ice cap and may be water ice cloud or dust.",
