    "description": "A beautiful ISS Lunar transit occurred right over my home on 12-04-2017, and I was fortunate enough to have dodged clouds for the capture!\r\n\r\nThanks to transit-finder.com for the awesome calculator.  The ISS was about 61\" across and the transit lasted 0.64 second.  My 60D recorded HD video at 30 frames per second, and I extracted each frame and stacked them to obtain this composite photo.\r\n\r\nThe Moon itself was processed using about 200 frames of a 2-minute video during the transit using PIPP and AS!2.",
