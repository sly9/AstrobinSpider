    "description": "This area of the sky is unique in that it captures two planetary nebula in one relatively narrow field of view. Both nebula are dominated by light in the OIII band, resulting in the bluish tint from my HOO palette. Both nebula are extremely faint and not visible in my subs. The larger PN, HFG 1, was discovered in 1982. It has an apparent diameter of about half of our full moon. Its central star is the 14.5 binary, V664 Cas. It is seen as the brightest, small point of light in the exact center of the nebula. \r\n\r\nThere are many interesting aspects of this nebula to me. The first is the bright rim to the lower left, which is separated by a large gap from the central nebula. Three bright bluish lobes lie between the rim and the center. The center area itself is relatively clear of nebulosity. A long, faint reddish trail of hydrogen extends from the center up to the right. Most interesting is the small reddish nebulous blob to the left of center. I have not seen this interesting blob explained in any of the literature. \r\n\r\nAbell 6 is more of a traditional planetary nebula. It has a diameter of 3 arc minutes. The outer edge of the nebula is brighter and shows traces of hydrogen. The central star is very faint and I am not sure if I am seeing it in the image, or just an artifact.",
