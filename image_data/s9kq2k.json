    "description": "Hello, this time we present a well-known galaxy in the ERIDAN: \r\n\r\nNGC 1532 is a barred spiral galaxy (morphological type SB(s)b ), located in the constellation of Eridan about 47 million light-years from the Milky Way.  \r\nNGC 1532 is the largest and brightest galaxy in a group that bears his name. \r\n\r\nThe group of NGC 1532 includes at least 9 other galaxies according to A.M. Garcia: IC 2040, IC 2041, NGC 1531, NGC 1537, ESO 2359-29, ESO 359-31, ESO 420-5, ESO 420-6 and ESO 420-9. \r\n\r\nThe image clearly shows his interaction with NGC 1531,engaged in a spirited waltz the deformed foreground spiral galaxy laced with dust lanes NGC 1532 is so close to its companion — the background galaxy with a bright core just above the centre of NGC 1532 — that it gets distorted: one of its spiral arms is warped and plumes of dust and gas are visible above its disc. The cosmic dance leads to another dramatic effect: a whole new generation of massive stars were born in NGC 1532 because of the interaction. They are visible as the purple objects in the spiral arms",
