    "description": "Update 09/05/17\r\n\r\nI have improved the color balance using HLVG and applied a minor additional curves stretch.\r\n\r\n \r\nI  spent twelve nights imaging this amazing nebula, some nights I managed to capture only one image and other nights I was more successful. The editing process this time also involved adjusting the colors using Photoshop 'Selective color' feature based on Bob Franke's tutorial to produce more goldish colors and to remove magenta stars . \r\n\r\nThis image is best to view full resolution to notice features e.g; keyhole nebula, the famous Mystic mountain (Herbig Haro) and dark globules.",
