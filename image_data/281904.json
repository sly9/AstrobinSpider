    "description": "Jupiter IR Pass\r\nStarting the processing of the photos in IR. In that first edition capture made in the length of 685 nanometers.\r\nMany details are always visible in this waveband because Jupiter emits much in the IR.\r\nI think colleagues know that each wavelength captures clouds and details at different altitudes on the planet, so it's interesting to use the various IR filters as well as methane.",
