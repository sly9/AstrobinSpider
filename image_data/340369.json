    "description": "This is the last post of images from the Eta Carina Nebula. It is just the H-alpha/Luminosity layer used to make the Hubble Palette image. The colored Hubble Palette image shows detail that is unique. But the grey-scale H-alpha image really brings out the detail of this emission cloud of hydrogen gas without the distraction of color. Zoom in to the full resolution image. Even at that scale the image does not break down. If we had an even longer FL scope there would be even greater detail in this target.",
