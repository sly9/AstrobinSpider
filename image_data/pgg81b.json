    "description": "The Sculptor Galaxy (also known as the Silver Coin, Silver Dollar Galaxy, NGC 253, or Caldwell 65) is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Sculptor. The Sculptor Galaxy is a starburst galaxy, which means that it is currently undergoing a period of intense star formation.\r\n\r\nThe galaxy was discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1783 during one of her systematic comet searches. About half a century later, John Herschel observed it using his 18-inch metallic mirror reflector at the Cape of Good Hope. He wrote: \"very bright and large (24′ in length); a superb object.... Its light is somewhat streaky, but I see no stars in it except 4 large and one very small one, and these seem not to belong to it, there being many near...\"\r\n\r\nSource: Wikipedia\r\nAs one of the brightest galaxies in the sky, the Sculptor Galaxy can be seen through binoculars.\r\nesearch suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole in the center of this galaxy with a mass estimated to be 5 million times that of our Sun, which is slightly heavier than Sagittarius A.\r\n\r\nA weighted average of the most reliable distance estimates gives a distance of 11.4 ± 0.7 Mly (3.5 ± 0.2 Mpc).\r\n\r\nIt was registered in 2020, May using my Remotely Controlled Observatory, located in Campos do Jordão, a beaultiful and small city in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.",
