    "description": "This was a massive processing project for me, using a 8\" f3 RC scope, at the remote site in Spain through ITU [Image The Universe]. I have never done a 4 pane mosaic before, and I found this tough to manage and hard to stitch together. \r\n\r\nMakarian's Chain is a vast area of multiple galaxies, with most of us being more familiar with the chain found in the bottom right part of the picture. All subs were at 10 minutes in length. So... Pane 1 consists of 29 luminances, and 13 of each of RGB, Pane 2 had 19 luminances, and 12 of each in RG, but 18 of B, Pane 3 consists of 25 luminances, 10 R, 8 B and 11 G and Pane 4 consists of 27 luminances and 12 in each of RGB. Total integration time was: 41 hours -  a record for me!\r\n\r\nI counted about 80 galaxies in there, and some faint ones have no designation through astrobin - so there could be about 100. Amazing!",
