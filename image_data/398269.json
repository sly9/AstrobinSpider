    "description": "Lately, I've been aiming my Newtonian at a few of my favorite targets that I had done shortly after getting my monochrome camera. This was definitely one of my favorite early narrowband targets (and probably my favorite planetary of all time), but I didn't do such a good job of it my first time around (which also had a lot to do with not being very experienced as an imager). I think I accomplished most of what I wanted to do this time around aside from a little detail within the nebula. I might try adding some more data to it next year with the RC to see if I can't tease out more detail.",
