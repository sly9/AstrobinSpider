    "description": "A few day ago I posted a rather noisy version of this object as the first light of my second RASA 8. Stars were also suffering as I have not got the sensor distance and alignment tuned in yet. Now I managed to catch an additional 4.7 hours using the better tuned first RASA 8, and it made so much difference that I post it separately. More dust and deeper colours.\r\n\r\nEarlier in March I imaged the central part of the Volcano Nebula near M81 and M82. After that I also imaged and posted a southernmost part of this area of Integrated Flux Nebulosity (IFN). The part shown here is to the north and it contains plenty of both reddish and gray IFN, similar to the IFN in the southernmost part of the Volcano Nebula.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, also like in the previous image the reddish IFN does not show as much structure as the grayish IFN, which is quite filamentous. Obviously they are two different things.\r\n\r\nI get the impression that some kind of interstellar wind is blowing from left to right in the image and the left side of the nebula looks to be hitting against some wave of pressure.",
