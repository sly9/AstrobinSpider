    "description": "NGC 1808 barred spiral galaxy in the constellation of Columba.  It is actually a complex object, with a weak bar around the nucleus, an outer ring, and tightly wound spiral arms. This galaxy has a high level of star formation, which suggests that it may have had an interaction with NGC 1792 in the past. NGC 1808 has 11 companion galaxies.\r\n\r\nNGC 1808 is a “peculiar” galaxy, appearing in the Catalog of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and Associations, by Halton Arp and Barry Madore. It meets the criteria for two different categories of peculiar galaxies:\r\n\r\nCategory 8—Galaxies with Apparent Companions\r\nCategory 10—Galaxies with Prominent or Unusual Dust Absorption\r\n\r\nTech Notes for ASA 500/3.6:\r\nASA Newtonian, 500 mm aperture, 1900mm focal length, F3.6\r\nFLI Proline 16803, 9 mm pixel, 4096 X 4096\r\nASA DDM85 equatorial mount\r\nProcessing with PixInsight, StarTools, and Affinity Photo",
