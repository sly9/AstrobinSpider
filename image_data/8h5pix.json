    "description": "(Please, if you enjoy seeing these kinds of images become a follower. Thank you.)\r\n\r\nNGC 3310 is a starburst, grand design spiral galaxy that has collided with another galaxy recently:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.adamblockphotos.com/ngc-3310.html\r\n\r\nThe collision has caused NGC 3310 to light up with prodigious star formation (pink) and hot bluish, massive, stars. You might wonder where the other galaxy is? Likely the faint loops, plumes and tidal tails that surround this galaxy are all that remain. Scroll down to the  bottom of the page to see the outer structure. This image was more than 10 years in the making. The data comes from 2011, 2017, and some recent color images.  I have been chasing this galaxy having visited it each epoch of my imaging career. I think it should be more well known! \r\n\r\nThe dynamic range of NGC 3310 and the glare of fifth magnitude star HD 92095 make this a real challenge. I used to be known as a \"galaxy guy\" and I hope you agree I used every ounce of those powers to show you a galaxy unlike any other in the local Universe. NGC 3310 is around 40 million light years away. A supernova recently exploded in this galaxy- however the image here is from data prior to the event. \r\n \r\nI *love* the weird linear spokes in the disk that are testament to the great forces at work. In addition, the faintest outer loops of this galaxy are not known in the literature (that I am aware of)- so you are the first to see them well.",
