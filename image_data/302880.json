    "description": "The shortest nights of the year were clear and blessed with good seeing. Good resolution into the core and countless faint galaxies in the field were the happy harvest, in NGC6207 even some HII knots can be seen.\r\n\r\n53+20+14+16 x 3min subframes LRGB with Asi1600 at zero gain and Lacerta 10\" f/4 Photonewton\r\n\r\nOriginally a comparison was shown, but that got lost forever at the total crash of Astrobin that occured in 2020. VizieR query came up with sdss7 catalogue, and on the Aladin overlay of a POSS pic a star of mag 23.5 could be identified. One of my deepest astro photos.\r\n\r\nInstead a crop on tiny NGC6207 is presented, that was saved on Flickr.",
