    "description": "This is a 1x2 panel mosaic. This was captured around the full moon so it was challenging to model the background to manage the gradients. I relied heavily on PI and LocalNormalization as well as DBE with several focused iterations. I managed to tame them pretty decently as the Sii and Oiii were gradient heavy.\r\n\r\nI am fairly happy with the result, arguably I could capture more Sii/Oiii as it's less than I would normally try and achieve, however the signal came out pretty well to provide some decent color. If I do anything else it will probably be RGB for some star color.",
