    "description": "In juanuary 2017,  I posted my first image on AB. It was a picture of NGC 2392 taken with an ASI 224 MC using Lucky Imaging (500 ms frames) : \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/278908/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/278908/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>\r\n\r\n2 years later (2019), I have changed my camera for an ASI 290 MMC to continue with Lucky Imaging on DSO, using shorter exposure times. I have also upgraded my scope (secondary and focuser) and tried to learn more on processing.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, The seeing was very good here. So I decided to come back on this \"eskimo\" to see how I can improve the image. I took 3 hours of 200ms and 100ms frames with the ASI 290 MMC, 1 hour with the ASI 294 MC Pro for color. I mixed all the data, including the 2017 one, in a long processing session with SIRIL and AS!3, then finishing with CS. The ASI 290 MMC 100 ms data is mainly used in the center of the nebula.\r\n\r\nThe result is not a revolution as the 2017 picture was already good. But I think there are some improvements in the center. The picture is less Noisy as there is far more data. The ASI 290 makes it bigger. I made It more blue than green this time (the ASI 294 image is less green than, the ASI 224 one). Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nCS\r\n\r\nJF",
