    "description": "This was imaged over many nights.  Basically I would tack on a couple of hours of collection on this target near the end of the night when Cygnus had risen above my tree-line. \r\n\r\nIt feels good to be getting some narrowband data to work with after the Galaxy season.  I had forgotten how much fun one could have with color palettes and custom pixelmath blending.  \r\n\r\nThis small feature within the Pelican nebula looks like the edge of a world that drops off a steep cliff into the void.   It's a beautiful region and feature.  I'm happy to give it some quality time. \r\n\r\nC&C welcome.",
