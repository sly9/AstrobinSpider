    "description": "Just before things got crazy, I was able to take a \"mental health trip\" to the desert. I was hoping to take advantage of some clear skies, but over the course of a week, I had one clear night and one clearish night, neither allowing me to capture the rising core of our Milky Way. I was treated to a wonderful view of our setting outer arm of our Milky Way with the Zodiacal light, airglow, Venus, Andromeda and Triangulum Galaxies, and of course the wonderful nebulae peppering our Northern winter skies. over the San Rafael Swell.\r\n\r\nModded a7iii\r\nTamron 35mm SP \r\nForeground: ISO 800, f3.2, 176s\r\nSky: 16 images, ISO 640, f2, 116s\r\nPTGUI and PS",
