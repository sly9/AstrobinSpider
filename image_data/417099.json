    "description": "More test data from the TOA-150 that will eventually end up shooting the south. Personally I love refractors, this one is no different. Can't wait to see what we can get with it. \r\n\r\nThis image in particular though is just more test data we had. Because it's test data though, it is a little on the low end for integration. Especially for how much IFN I tried to bring out. I still think it came out acceptable though. While the IFN isn't as pronounced as some previous images, the details are unrivaled. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
