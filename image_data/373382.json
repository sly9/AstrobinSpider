    "description": "Here's my first result on my h and x Persei Cluster mosaic project. Following a great image of Mike Oates I want to see if I can also get some Ha nebula in there. Currently I am only at 10 hours ha but will probably need 40 as I need to shoot two panels to get a nice field of view.\r\n\r\nAnyway I was keen to get the RGB version out so here it is: The great Double Cluster in Perseus. Hope you like and watch this space for some serious Ha exposure time soon if the weather is nice to me ;)",
