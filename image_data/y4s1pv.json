    "description": "Darren (DMach) recently published his full data set of Jupiter OSC captures from 2019-05-26 (UT). He had practically perfect seeing conditions and the video footage shows Jupiter like a still image. Surely sub 1 arc second. With those conditions and the resolution achievable with his C11, the outcome was always going to be good. He also managed to beautifully capture a huge red streamer flaking off the GRS. You may recall that at that time last year, this was quite a regular occurrence. I have processed his data and using WinJUPOS to derotate and integrate the 3 x 90 sec runs. The extra data means a slightly lower level of noise. I also colour balanced the histograms which pulled down the red a bit so that my rendition has a slightly different colour tone. Otherwise I think the final result is very similar.\r\nAn interesting an fun exercise it was. Thanks very much Darren.",
