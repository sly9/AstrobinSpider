    "description": "NGC 6188 is an emission nebula located about 4,000 light years away in the constellation Ara. NGC 6188 is a star forming nebula, and is sculpted by the massive, young stars that have recently formed there – some are only a few million years old. This spark of formation was probably caused when the last batch of stars went supernova. \r\n\r\nOn Brazil we call NGC6188 of Ara's Dragons. On capture was used SHO filters  to show some details  only visible on Hubble Palette.",
