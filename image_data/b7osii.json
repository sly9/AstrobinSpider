    "description": "On holiday in the Eifel in Germany and hoping for clear nights, but unfortunately it seems that most of the times it's clouded and lightning in the evening. So I already gave my hopes up a bit when yesterday evening I noticed it was clearing up. Against my feeling I decided to just build up the equipment and see what would happen. Somehow I was lucky and while there was lightning in the distance the sky kept clear right over my head until about 4 in the morning. So I decided to work on some dark nebulae as they are impossible to image from my home location. \r\n\r\nI used my setup using the Spacecat and Nikon D810a with an Asiair controlling everything. This works really great, except for a few times the guiding just stopped without a reason, and so I was able to catch in total 29x300s of images of LDN 1235/1251. LDN 1235 is also known as the shark nebula but somehow this image makes me think of a shark lurking under water to catch the swimmer (LDN1251) at the surface.\r\n\r\nDuring the imaging I took time to enjoy the Milky Way shining over me and see some nice details even with the naked eye. During the night quite a lot of Perseids were visible, sometimes very quick and shortly visible, but also a few that left a nice trail. \r\n\r\nThanks for watching and I hope for a few more nice nights to get even more detail out of this image in the coming nights.",
