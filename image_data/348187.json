    "description": "This object was a challenge at only 2' x 2' and between magnitude 15 and 16.\r\n\r\nSeyfert's Sextet is a group of galaxies about 190 million light-years away in the constellation Serpens. The group appears to contain six members, but one of the galaxies is a background object and another \"galaxy\" is actually a separated part of one of the other galaxies. The gravitational interaction among these galaxies should continue for hundreds of millions of years. Ultimately, the galaxies will merge to form a single giant elliptical galaxy.\r\n\r\nThe small S-shaped galaxy, NGC 6027d, is not interacting with the other galaxies in the cluster, but is in the background and just happens to be in the same line of sight. The galaxy is nearly 900 million light years from Earth and is believed to be extremely large in size at magnitude 16.47.\r\n\r\nHubble version here...\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seyfert%27s_Sextet#/media/File:Seyfert_Sextet_full.jpg",
