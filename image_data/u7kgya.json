    "description": "This is the famous galaxy almost made entirely with dark matter.\r\n\r\nI believe this is the first time (?) this object has been captured by an amateur astronomer with amateur equipment. \r\n\r\n\"Dragonfly 44 is an ultra diffuse galaxy in the Coma Cluster,Observations of the velocity dispersion suggest a mass of about one trillion solar masses, about the same as the mass of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThis ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is discovered by the Dragonfly telescope array team.\r\n\r\nthe galaxy emits only 1% of the light emitted by the Milky Way. The galaxy was discovered with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array\r\n\r\nIn August 2016, astronomers reported that this galaxy might be made almost entirely of dark matter\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI captured this object in the Coma wide field about 5 nights of imaging with total around 18 hr of imaging time with LRGB. This was an accidental discovery from my image because originally I was plan to capture Coma galaxy deep field.  While reading on Dragonfly 44 I noticed it is located in Coma cluster so I went head and found it in my data.I was extremely pleased with my result and happy that I have captured something this rare and unique object.",
