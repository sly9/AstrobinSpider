    "description": "I already shoot this object last year with the same newton LACERTA 250/1000, but  I had collected only 2hours ...  this time, the objective was to do the maximum to get good subs (with small FWHM, I keep only the FWHM under 2,3''), and enough exposues on all the filters  to keep noise at a low level. \r\nWith my new mount :-) \r\nI like this version much better !\r\n\r\n9 nights in July y : 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 29\r\n\r\n68 SII Subs @300s (gain 139, -20°C)\r\n116 OIII Subs @300s (gain 139, -20°C)\r\n100 HalphaSubs @300s (gain 139, -20°C)\r\n\r\nTotal => 284 subs @300s = 23h 40minutes",
