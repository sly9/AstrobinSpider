    "description": "A modest capture made in a very difficult situation.\r\nThere were about 20 films, most of them lost due to the gusts of wind that moved the planet out of the capture screen, in addition to many clouds passing which made light control a real adventure. After all, one is better than nothing, at least I managed to register this rare event because the next, I do not know if I will still be here.",
