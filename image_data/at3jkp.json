    "description": "I share with you an unforeseen memory of the Namibian nights.\r\nI had spotted the worrisome silhouette of the standing tree by day, but it was by night that the white strain was revealed.\r\nThe branches form a setting around the lights of the capital Windhoek where appears the Milky Way ... Luck is sometimes good things!\r\nThis night was largely the coldest, temperatures dropped below 4 Â° C. The observation conditions were magical, I think I never had the chance to see such a sky so far!\r\nIn the branches of the tree, the star Vega, one of the brightest in the sky.\r\n\r\n- Panorama of 2 images -",
