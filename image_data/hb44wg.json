    "description": "With a little delay here I leave the result of my last visit, to this famous pair of galaxies.\r\nBode's Galaxy (to the left of the image, also known as the Spiral Galaxy M81) is a spiral galaxy located 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major.\r\nThe Cigar galaxy (on the right in the image, also known as the M82 Irregular Galaxy) is an irregular galaxy, with a high rate of star formation.\r\nAlthough we cannot forget IFN the dust structure that surrounds them, since in the present image it is one more protagonist.",
