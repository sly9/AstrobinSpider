    "description": "The great Andromeda.  I havent shot this target a lot. I have only attempted this once before. Mainly due to not having the FOV . Mosaics are not possible from Austin's skies for broadband. This time, as a part of shooting NGC1333, this was my parking target while waiting for NGC1333 to rise. \r\n\r\nThis image has no noise reduction applied. The camera is pretty clean and I basically treated it as a CCD going with longer subs than the usual short subs common with CMOS. This is using the mode 0, Gain 26, offset 10 mode. There is basically no discernable star saturation to worry about as it can be seen in the image. \r\nThe extended halo is visible and Ha was blended into the R channel selectively to enhance the Ha regions.\r\n\r\nI ended up collecting \r\nL - 34x15m (out of 54 captured)\r\nR/G/B - 8x15m\r\nHa - 8x20m",
