    "description": "A galaxy by many names, NGC 253, Sculptor, Silver Coin, or Silver Dollar, this one has always been mainly known for its intense structures. With that in mind, I thought it would only be fitting to do my best to bring them out! Funnily enough, this is considered a starburst galaxy, meaning it is under going a period of intense star formation. However, it lacks a ton of huge HA areas that I am more accustom to seeing like in M82 and Cent A. Not quite sure what gives it that designation, but I'll trust the astronomers, and assume it is that structure obscuring all the awesome star forming regions! Also in regards to the integration times, there were some frames that seemed to have been taken before the sensor was cooled, so I didn't use those. This was fine for the color data, but it led to me tossing 4 hours of L data and only using 6 frames instead. Funnily enough though, that 1 hour of data taken at -30 looked better than all the data combined. \r\n\r\nClear skies!",
