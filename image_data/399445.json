    "description": "Sharpless 264, also known as the Lambda Orionis Ring, is a molecular cloud and H II region, which can be seen in the northern region of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex (OMCC), in the constellation of Orion. The OMCC is one of the best-known star formation regions and the closest sector of the Milky Way to our Solar System where high-mass stars are born. The nebula is named after its main star, Î» Orionis, a blue giant responsible for the ionization of the surrounding material. It is also sometimes called the Angelfish Nebula due to its resemblance as to its lighter areas (pink to peach colour) to an angelfish. In the infrared its ionized boundaries are that which appears, instead. - source: Wikipedia\r\n\r\nThis is another in a series of starless interpretations in deep hydrogen alpha light using the starnet++ software.  The image represents 18 individual mosaic tiles.  North is to the right in this orientation.",
