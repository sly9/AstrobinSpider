    "description": "Most sources agree that the pairing of NGC876 (edge-on) and 877 lies somewhere between 150 and 170 million light years distant.   Though specifics are scarce, I’d wager a bet that these are indeed an interacting pair.  The faint extended tidal tails of NGC877 indicate some sort of past disruption.  When I look at the image here, I get the distinct impression that one of these tails is actually sitting between us and the edge-on NGC876 galaxy, diminishing it’s light.   Regardless of the specifics, I immediately thought this pairing looked quite a bit like ARP273, “The Rose”.    \r\n\r\nThere are actually a few other galaxies here that share the similar estimated distance.   The diffuse and low surface brightness UGC01761 and the alarmingly bright and compact NGC871.   It is quite possible that these are all a fairly tight grouping within 1-2 million light years. \r\n   \r\nThis area of sky is absolutely littered with smaller galaxies.  NGC870 is one of the more prominent ones.  One that specifically caught my eye was 2MFGC 01771, for which I found very little information.  It looks just like the Needle Galaxy, only much more distant and can be seen at the bottom center of the frame.\r\n\r\nIt’s a nice little field, and I didn’t collect enough data to do it true justice.  Maybe someday…\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n",
