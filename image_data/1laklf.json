    "description": "I find the area surrounding the central cluster in this image to be fascinating.  It is also interesting to think about the fact that the dust and structures in this image may very well not be anywhere near the stars of cluster NGC 6910.  But it sure looks like quite a distination for a field trip.\r\n\r\nThis is a crop of a larger image taken with the FSQ 106 with .6x reducer and ASI 1600.  Being able to crop out sub images like this is a major reason why I like this camera/scope combo.\r\n\r\nLater I substituted Ha collected with the TOA 130 and ASI 1600",
