    "description": "In Sagittarius, between Messier 24 and Sh 2-35, there is a dark nebula that forms like a dark corner in between  those two objects. In the middle of the dark corner there is an emission nebulae called Sh 2-37 (or IC 1284). There are also two blue reflection nebulae surrounding two stars. I took Sh 2-37 in H-alpha and, in order to get the reflection nebulae, I combined it with the broadband filter in blue. I have tried this narrow+broad filter combination sometimes and it usually works very well in cases like this.",
