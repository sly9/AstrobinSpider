    "description": "We had a very heavy rain on November 8th with 60 mph winds. This finally cleared into an unusually transparent and steady sky. FWHM on the 15-minute Luminance subs was between 1.4\" and 2.1\". Perfect conditions for shooting tiny distant galaxies. (-:\r\n\r\n\"The Perseus cluster (Abell 426) is a cluster of galaxies in the constellation Perseus. It is one of the most massive objects in the known universe, containing thousands of galaxies immersed in a vast cloud of multimillion-degree gas.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team of astronomers led by Dr. Andrew Fabian at Cambridge University discovered one of the deepest notes ever detected. No human will actually hear the note, because its time period between oscillations is 9.6 million years, which is 57 octaves below the keys in the middle of a piano. The sound waves appear to be generated by the inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma by the central active galactic nucleus in NGC 1275.\r\n\r\nNGC 1275 has also been forming thousands of new globular clusters over the last billion years out of a cool gas.\r\n\r\nThis network of cool gas precipitates from the hot gas that infuses the entire Perseus galaxy cluster. In fact, the gas concentrates in the center allowing it to cool faster and that leads to the creation of globular clusters.\r\n\r\nOnce formed, these infant globular clusters do not remain in the network of cool gas but rain inwards onto the giant galaxy like raindrops falling from the clouds.\"",
