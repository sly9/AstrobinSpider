    "description": "The Swan Tulip hides a dark secret.\r\nLast summer I photographed the SH2 101, more commonly known as the Tulip Fog in the Summer Milky Way, more precisely in the Swan constellation. The processing was a bit delayed, but I managed to reach my main goal, to find traces of the Cygnus X-1 black hole with amateur equipment alongside the Tulip Nebula.\r\nIn addition to the visual experience of the picture, it is the bluish arc on the right side of the photo. This arc of ionized gas is a shock wave, which we know is a black hole (Cygnus X-1) from which we can visually see the material congestion of a relativist jet that breaks out due to material transfer. While the black hole itself cannot be seen by observing the effects on its environment, it indirectly betrayes itself.",
