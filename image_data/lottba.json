    "description": "Actually it should have been just a test run of my new MGEN3. Contrary to all weather forecasts I went optimistically to one of my favourite astrolocations - the Hohe Wand. I figured if it only stays clear for an hour to test it, I'm happy. Fortunately, the clear weather lasted until dawn, so in the end it was almost 4. 5 hours of this beautiful galaxy in Draco. I can tell you, the MGEN3 with its multistar guiding really delivers perfectly round stars and runs like clockwork. \r\nFor demonstration purposes I have added a Luminance version with a DynamicPSF- See version C. \r\nI am very happy with this device.
