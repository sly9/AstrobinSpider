    "description": "Lynds Dark Nebula 1251, including several HH objects and nice little spiral galaxy peaking through the obscuring molecular cloud. \r\n\r\nI enjoy dark nebulae as a nice detour from the reds and blues we usually encounter in the sky.  A nice dirty brown to keep things interesting!\r\n\r\nThis one is quite large as I've only captured about a third of it in my FOV.",
