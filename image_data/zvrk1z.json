    "description": "Also known as SH 2-229 or Caldwell31 is an emission and reflection nebula in the constellation of Auriga.\r\nThe nebula lies in a distance about 1500 lightyears from my telescope lens and camera.\r\n\r\nThe subs were shot in two nights in temperatures as low as -16Â°C and the equipment worked flawlessly, almost boringðŸ¤£.\r\nI did not manage to bring out the blue \"smoke\" from the  reflection nebula surrounding the star AE  Auriga. I suppose it have something to do with the narrowband filter I am using so I  blended in som data from an older image shot with a Nikon D610 to bring out the \"smoke\".",
