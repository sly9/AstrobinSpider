    "description": "M31, The Andromeda Galaxy, needs no introduction. Probably the most commonly imaged galaxy out there, but more beautiful than any. Home of an estimated trillion stars, large blue star forming regions which give off so much energy causing the Hydrogen gas clouds they were formed from to glow red. \r\n\r\nI waited for two years to image this galaxy, waiting for the perfect combination of clear skies, no moon, and decent seeing. That came Nov.7/8. I dedicated one night to Ha and the following night to LRGB before the weather turned again. \r\n\r\nI then spent several days off and on processing over and over again to do this beautiful galaxy the justice it deserved. I wanted to emphasize 4 items from my processing and I am hoping I hit them. I wanted to emphasize overall  galactic structure, new star formations (blue), Red brilliant Ha regions, and dark dust structure.\r\n\r\nAfter staring at my final image for what seemed to be hours, I noticed that the galaxy seemed to have a bit of an S-shaped warp to it. The lower left of the galaxy as imaged seems to be pointed slightly up and the upper right as imaged seems to be pointing down. After researching to see if M31 actually has a warp to it, it does! thought to have been caused by an interaction with M33, the Triangulum Galaxy. I though this was neat, as it was a personal discovery I made when viewing my image.\r\n\r\nI would love to here your thoughts, two years waiting, was it worth it?\r\n\r\nCS and be well\r\nDan.",
