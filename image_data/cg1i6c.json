    "description": "Gas Menagerie, Including Ou-4 (The Squid Nebula), Sh2-129 (The Flying Bat Nebula) and Bernard 150 (The Dark Seahorse Nebula) as well as others. 19hrs Oiii from B2 skies and 29 hrs Ha from mixed B6 and B2 skies. Over 1000miles driven for 3 separate dark sky site visits. I would have liked to get LRGB for the stars and especially for the Seahorse seen as the dark nebula in the upper right corner, but I am pretty darn exhausted from this 6 weeks long project. The two channels were combined into a RGB combination and  the only post processing was EZ Soft Stretch, a few iterations of masked curves transformation and then EZ Star Reduction. The un-reduced full size of the 2 panel mosaic is about 4.6GB..... I went ahead and reduced it a bit to upload here.",
