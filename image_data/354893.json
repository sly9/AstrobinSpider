    "description": "This object is a tiny planetary nebula located 4000 light years away in the constellation of Aquila.  It spans an apparent width of less than one minute.  The bluish central star is clearly visible.  \r\n\r\nI like the bright white inner ring.  It is fairly wide and has a unique, detailed structure.  It even has a bit of a spiral appearance.  Despite having an interesting look, the nebula has no popular nickname.\r\n\r\nNote to self - do not image tiny objects when it is windy.  The nebula looks OK in the image, but the smaller stars are all ovals.",
