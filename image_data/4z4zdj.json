    "description": "NGC7822 is part of the question mark nebula. Last year I shot the whole nebula through Tak-85edx. The core is still very appealing with young star in make. So this one target the core entirely. Comparing to last couple of  faint objects I shot, this is very bright. It is very enjoyable to collect strong signal.\r\n\r\nNights: 11/6/2020, 11/7/2020, 11/9/2020, 11/10/2020, 11/11/2020, 11/12/2020, 11/14/2020, 11/16/2020\r\n\r\nSubs:\r\nHa: 22X1800\"\r\nO3: 30x1800\"\r\nS2: 23x1800\"\r\nRGB: 30 x120\" each",
