    "description": "Clear skies are sure hard to come by lately. In the past couple of months it’s been just a few here and there and horrible seeing. This image is far less integration time than I’m used to so I had to really squeeze what I could out of it. It’s a fair bit noisier than what I’m used to but I wanted to process something. \r\n\r\nThe Cone Nebula region in Monoceros surrounds the open star cluster NGC2264. It is rich with star forming regions and gas clouds whipped into wonderful shapes by stellar radiation in the area. The central bright star in the field, S Monocerotis, is part of a quadruple star system that in large part is responsible for the irradiation of the surrounding nebula. \r\n\r\nWeb sites:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.stellarsolace.com/\">StellarSolace</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StellarSolace-1588021434610921/\">Facebook page</a>",
