    "description": "The Squid Nebula is an extremely faint object thought to be around 2,300 light years away in the constellation of Cepheus and was discovered relatively recently (2011) by a French amateur astrophotographer named Nicolas Outters.  It is catalogued as Outters 4, or Ou 4.  It was initially thought that the Squid might be a planetary nebula, but this is no longer considered to be the case.  The nature of the object is, at this time, unknown, although the ‘bipolar outflow’ is centred around the star cluster containing HR 8119 (Corradi et al, Astronomy and Astrophysics 570 - 2014).  \r\n\r\nThe Squid is surrounded by the much brighter Flying Bat nebula (Sharpless 129) – a large emission nebula.  \r\n\r\nThis is a 4 panel mosaic which was photographed between 21 August and 16 October 2020 using a rig in Spain that is privately owned and remotely operated by Barry Wilson and me.  Back in 2017, I attempted the Squid using my widefield dual rig.  I was able to accumulate a reasonable amount of OIII signal in 2017 and I decided to incorporate that into the new data. \r\n\r\nCapture Details:\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106 \r\nCamera: QSI 683\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 96 x 1200s \r\nOIII: 84 x 1800s\r\nRed: 72 x 300s\r\nGreen: 72 x 300s\r\nBlue: 72 x 300s\r\n\r\n2017\r\n\r\nTelescope: William Optics Star 71\r\nCamera: Moravian G2-8300\r\nFilter: Chroma\r\nMount: Skywatcher EQ6-R\r\n\r\nOIII: 31 x 1200s\r\n\r\nTotal exposure: 102 hours and 20 minutes. \r\n\r\n\r\nData: Steve Milne, Barry Wilson and Lis Milne\r\nProcessing: Steve Milne",
