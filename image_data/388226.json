    "description": "This small faint object, also known as NGC 3310, is a starburst galaxy located 60 million light years away in the constellation of Ursa Major.  It is a compact grand design spiral galaxy with a diameter of about 30,000 light years.  Its apparent size to us is about 3 minutes and its magnitude is 11.2.\r\n\r\nAstronomers believe that its unusual shape is because the spiral galaxy devoured a small dwarf galaxy about 100 million years ago.  As typically happens, this interaction kicked off a period of intense star formation, reflected by the reddish HII regions seen throughout the galaxy.  There are many star clusters seen here, visible in the image as the bright blue regions in the galaxyâ€™s spiral arms.  Another sign of the galactic interaction are the tidal streams which are visible, especially the two arcs on the upper right side of the galaxy.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Cambridge Galaxy Atlas, this galaxy is one of the bluest galaxies in the sky.   However, although hard to detect in my image, the two tidal stream arcs at upper right are a different color from the main galaxy, suggesting that these two arcs did not originate from the original galaxy disk.\r\n\r\nThis object has been on my \"to-do\" list since it first came to me attention in the March 2018 Sky and Telescope article entitled, \"Star Factories - Observing Starburst Galaxies\".  The article did not include a picture, so I was happily surprised when I saw the beauty and detail of the object in this image.",
