    "description": "\"The Statue of Liberty Nebula\" - NGC 3576 - No other nebula is probbaly not this much aptly named. It's called \"The Statue of Liberty Nebula\"  because of the distinctive shape in the middle of the nebula. It is a bright emission nebula in the Sagittarius arm of the galaxy a few thousand light-years away from the Eta Carinae nebula. It is also approximately 100 light years across and 9000 light-years away from Earth.  Within the nebula, episodes of star formation are thought to contribute to the complex and suggestive shapes. Powerful winds from the nebula's embedded, young, massive stars shape the looping filaments.\r\n\r\nThis image was taken by a Telescope.Live remote telescope.\r\nTelescope: ASA 500N, 50 cm F3.6 Reflector, Focal length: 1900 mm\r\nMount: ASA DDM85 equatorial mount with direct drives\r\nCamera: FLI PL 16803, Pixel Size: 9 Î¼m, Pixel Array: 4096 x 4096\r\nFrames: Halpha - 2x600\", SII - 2x600\", OIII - 2x600\"\r\nSoftware: PixInsight, GIMP and DeepSkyStacker",
