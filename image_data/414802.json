    "description": "I reprocessed Pickeringâ€™s Triangle data that I posted as a cropped HOO image a couple of weeks ago, this time keeping the uncropped, acquisition framing and compared an HOO/RGB version(Version A) to an SHO rendition (Version C). While I find that there may be a bit more structure revealed by the SHO version, for my taste, I prefer the look of an HOO/RGB treatment of this object. What are your thoughts? Do you tend to use a certain processing approach for one type of emission nebula versus another?",
