    "description": "This mosaic of 7 tiles for 80 mega pixels represents a large field around the Large Magellanic Cloud. I was delighted to be able to obtain such a detailed image with material, all in all, modest for astrophotography.\r\nThis irregular galaxy, composed of a single spiral arm, is crossed by a large bar.\r\nIt is very rich in celestial objects including the Tarantula nebula (NGC 2070), the largest known nebula. It was in the region of this nebula that we had the chance to discover the candidate planetary nebula FoGl 1 during a trip to Chile in 2018.\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to follow the link to TIFF/FITS to open the full zoomable version.\r\n\r\nTotal exposure time : 17 hours.\r\nAcquisitions from the 22nd to the 26th of December 2019.\r\nPlace : Hacienda des Etoiles, Ovalle region (Chile).",
