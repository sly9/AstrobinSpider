    "description": "Running chicken Nebula consists of IC 2944 and IC 2948 (shown). IC 2944 is an open cluster with an associated emission nebula found in the constellation Centaurus, near the star λ Centauri (shown).\r\n\r\nThe region of nebulosity visible in modern images includes both IC 2944 and IC 2948, as well as the fainter IC 2872 nearby (not shown). IC 2948 is the brightest emission and reflection nebulae towards the southeast, while IC 2944 is the cluster of stars and surrounding nebulosity stretching towards λ Centauri.\r\n\r\nThis is an SHO composition with RGB background and stars.",
