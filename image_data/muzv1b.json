    "description": "This image shows the massive star EZ Canis Majoris surrounded by the Sh2-308 (emission) nebula.\r\n\r\nEZ Canis Majoris is a Wolf-Rayet star. These are some of the brightest and most massive stars in the universe, dozens of times as massive as our sun.\r\n\r\nIntense winds from these stars produce gas bubbles in the surrounding material.\r\n\r\nEZ Canis Majoris is responsible for creating the Sh2-308 bubble - the star expelled its outer layers to produce the filaments seen in this image. Intense, continuous radiation pushes the bubble further and further away from the star, making it larger and larger. Currently, the Sh2-308 bubble-shaped gas cloud is 60 light years across!\r\n\r\nThough beautiful, these cosmic bubbles are, like everything, temporary.\r\nThe same stars that gave rise to it will also destroy them when those same stars explode as supernovas.",
