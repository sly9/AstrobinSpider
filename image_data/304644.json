    "description": "NGC 5139\r\nAt a distance of about 15,800 light-years from Earth. Omega Centauri is one of the few globular clusters visible to the naked eyeâ€”and appears almost as large as the full Moon when seen from a dark, rural area. It is the brightest, largest and the most massive known globular cluster associated with the Milky Way. The stars in the core of Omega Centauri are so crowded that they are estimated to average only 0.1 light years away from each other.",
