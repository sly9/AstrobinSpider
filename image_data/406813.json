    "description": "This is shot using equipment shared by me and Dhaval Bhrambhatt in Marathon, Texas (MaRIO). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always loved interacting galaxy pairs and will shoot everytime I get a chance. This is a nice, similar sized galaxies interacting with each other.  The target is estimated to be 355 million light years using redshift measurement.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of going deep on this target and again the weather has been absolutely horrible and I got nowhere with it.  I finally decided (like I always end up doing) to process the data and archive it and collect more data when I get chance later. It at-least clears my workspace but I am not satisfied with the final results. The stars are not good, the colors are anemic, the details are not as crisp I was hoping for.",
