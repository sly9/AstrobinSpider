    "description": "The interesting Cone Nebula region, part of NGC 2264.  I've imaged this a number of times, but with a wider field of view to include more of the surrounding area.  This time I tried to concentrate on the Cone itself at higher resolution, and deep enough to show some of the delicate shading.  Not up to the famous Hubble image of this area, but we all keep trying.  DDP stretch in Maxim with mild unsharp mask.",
