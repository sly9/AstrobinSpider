    "description": "Several years ago I captured this beautiful region of Sky and called it “The Cosmic Continent”, here is my latest version a very wide view of The North America Nebula otherwise known as NGC7000 using data from Grand Mesa Observatory’s System 1a the William Optics Redcat together with a QHY16200A Monochrome CCD, this combination is giving a field of view of approximately 6 x 5 degrees. \r\nCaptured over 3 nights in May and June 2020 for a total acquisition time of 7 hours. \r\n(stay tuned for the hubble palette version) \r\n\r\nThe William Optics Redcat with QHY16200A with its 7 position filter wheel is now available for subscription, see here for details.\r\nhttps://grandmesaobservatory.com/equipment \r\n\r\nThe North America Nebula (NGC 7000 or Caldwell 20) is an emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus that resembles the shape of North America and The Gulf Of Mexico. It lies at a distance of approximately 1800 light years away from us.\r\nThis image contains some very interesting areas such as The Cygnus Wall which is representative of Mexico and Central America, the nearby emission objects Pelican Nebula (IC5070) and the faint emission nebula IC5068 \r\n\r\nTechnical Details\r\nCaptured and processed by: Terry Hancock\r\nLocation: GrandMesaObservatory.com Purdy Mesa, Colorado\r\nMay 5th, 25th, June 8th\r\nHA 240 min 24 x 900 sec\r\nLRGB 180 min 9 x 300 sec\r\nFilters by Chroma\r\nCamera: QHY16200A\r\nGain 0, Offset 130 Calibrated with Flat, Dark and Bias Frames.\r\nOptics: William Optics Redcat 51 APO @ F4.9\r\nEQ Mount: Paramount ME\r\nImage Acquisition software Maxim DL6\r\nPre Processing in Pixinsight\r\nPost Processed in Photoshop CC",
