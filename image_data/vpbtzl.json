    "description": "Comet Neowise on the morning of July 11 2:28-42am.  It was one of the most amazing locations and nights.  Location is High Rock lookout in the Mount Hood Wilderness.  The lights you see on the mountain appear to be climbers.  Those near the top are clearly moving up the mountain at 3am!  \r\n\r\nThe comet and stars are a stack of eight 30 second exposures F2.8 and F4, ISO 400.  The foreground is stack of seven 10 second shots at F4, ISO3200.  The Comet and stars were tracked using an Astrotrac.\r\n\r\nThe comet and stars were manually aligned in PS.  Stars, Comet and foreground were stacked separately.  The comet layer used Starnet++ to fully eliminate stars to allow the comet to be processed differently.",
