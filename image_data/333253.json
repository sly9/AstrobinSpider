    "description": "This beautiful galaxy is known as the Spanish Dancer.  NGC 1566 can be found in the constillation of Dorada (The Dolphinfish), at a distance of 40 million light years away.  Its apparent magnitude is 10.3, and its apparent size of 8.3 x 6.6 arc min.  It has a small but extremely bright nuclues.  This is a feature is found in the Seyfert class galaxies.  This class of galaxies are very active and extreamly luminous, emitting strong bursts of radiation. Supermassive black holes are believed to be near the centre of this galaxy.  NGC 1566 is the second brightest Seyfert glaxy known.\r\n\r\nInstruments Used:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\nLum \t1X1 \t49 X 900 sec  \t12.25 Hours\r\nRed \t2X2 \t15 X 450 sec\t1.875 Hours\r\nGreen \t2X2 \t23 X 450 sec\t2.875 Hours\r\nBlue \t2X2  \t16 X 450 sec\t2.000 Hours\r\nHa \t1X1 \t11 X 900 sec\t2.750 Hours\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nAustralia, Central Victoria\r\nImaged from Dec-Feb 2018\r\n\r\nPhotographer:\r\nTerry Robison",
