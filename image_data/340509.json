    "description": "Boy am I out of practice when it comes to processing! I shot this data in January and just haven't had time to sit down and process it. I'm not sure I'm 100% in love with how it turned out, so maybe I'll revisit this data in the future or incorporate it into my next attempt. \r\n\r\nHow it was constructed:\r\nI spent a lot of time thinking about how to piece this one together with the data I had - I wanted to do a narrowband-enhanced broadband image. Ultimately, I took the SII stack and combined it with the Ha stack (giving the SII preference wherever it had more structure) and pasted that into red giving it 50% luminosity. I then pasted the OIII into both the green and blue stacks, again giving the OIII 50% luminosity in each channel. I assembled the RGB from that. I then also made a bicolor stack from the Ha/SII and OIII+OIII and pasted that into the RGB and again set that to 50% luminosity (and masked a little in the core to keep the RGB color intact). I still ended up blowing out the core a little, and the colors are a little on the unique side, but I guess that's to be expected when not working with pure RGB data.",
