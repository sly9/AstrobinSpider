    "description": "Imaged after the half moon set on 30th October 2017, I was able to largely sort out field curvature issues I had been experiencing when imaging at f/7 using a Lepus Telecompressor. I am inexperienced at Deep Sky, so I was happy to produce this image as part of my journey. It was taken with a OSC camera and contains no narrowband subs, however the colours that came through are quite good I think.",
