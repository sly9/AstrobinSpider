    "description": "Here I included all the data collected that night so both 90 min at gain 100 (30 s subs) and 70 min at gain 0 (60 s subs). It brought out more dust and details in the core. I also did not crop this time to fit in as much dust as possible. For more info see my recent post:\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/jm5y5b/D/",
