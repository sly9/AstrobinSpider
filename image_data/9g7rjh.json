    "description": "Dark Skies never disappoint. This is LDN1217 - The Worm\nLast night I ventured 6 hours north to a Bortle 2 dark spot Cherry Springs, PA. I captured two DSO's, this being one of them. I'm super stoked with how they turned out. At only 4 1/2 hours integration time, the true magic of little to no light pollution really comes through here. I shot this 100% broadband at 390mm F4.8. The target is actually quite large and the star field is just massive in the surrounding area. I tried to keep it as natural as possible and didn't over process this. I used a color mask to only enhance the Hydrogen Alpha found nearby. I didn't use an Ha filter so I was surprised to find it there! I hope you enjoy this treasure as much as I do.",
