    "description": "NGC 918 is a Barred Spiral Galaxy in Aries about 70 million light years away.\r\nPart of the Galactic Cirrus MBM 8 can also be seen. It lies a few hundred light years above the galactic plane of the Milkyway.\r\nImaged on 5-6-7 November 2020\r\nDuring the last three days we have here some clear sky but not so good quality. The first two days as I shot the luminance, mediocre seeing and transparency, the third day as I shot the colour the sky has become worse. The colour image turned out really bad, I could use it strongly blurred, to give some colour to the luminance. I shot 187 x 2min lum images but only 124 x 2 min (4 hours) stacked\r\n\r\nLum : 124 x 2 minutes (4 hours) ASI 174mm\r\nColour : 18 x 10 minutes (3 hours) Moravian G3-11000c",
