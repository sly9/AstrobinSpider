    "description": "Lost In Time\r\n\r\nM31, The Andromeda Galaxy\r\n\r\nSince I havent been imaging for 3 months, Self- isolation has been an opportunity to revisit older data. I had this set of free data generously provided by @deepskywest team, and I had a run on it few months ago, which I think it didn't do justice for such clean and sharp data. So I processed it again and man I was shocked about the quality of it. Big thumb up to DSW guys at New Mexico.\r\nI extracted luminance component of the combined RGB and added it to luminance layer to include RGB exposure time in L layer to further increase the SNR.\r\n\r\nAstro-Physics RH-305\r\nSBIG STX-16803\r\nAP 1600GT\r\nLRGB: (50,33,44,21)Ã—5min\r\nTotal Exposure: 12h20min\r\nData provided by: @deepskywest",
