    "description": "My longest exposure yet (16 hours) and one of the first targets with my new Celestron CGX. The mount worked absolutely fine during those four nights between March 30 and April 11, 2019.\r\nHope you like the Hamburger Gx which is the northernmost galaxy of the famous Leo Triplet.\r\n\r\nBy the way... The spikes are created with two wires in front of the SC tube. It's a matter of taste ;)\r\n\r\nLocation: near WÃ¼rzburg, Germany",
