    "description": "VERY fortunate and grateful for this 2mb jpeg file that I now hold. I truly believe that the beauty of this passion stands in the stories behind of all these pictures. The craving, hunting, planning, failing, and cursing. I'm sure everyone here knows already what you need to go through. I had so many failures with catching the ISS across the Moon that I even poured myself a glass of champagne when I got back home! \r\n\r\nP.S. Thank you transit-finder.com for helping me end this chase.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate and time: 01.11.2020 - 00:59 UT\r\nISS angular size: 46.43″; distance: 595.08 km\r\nAltitude: 43.2°\r\nTransit duration: 0.95s",
