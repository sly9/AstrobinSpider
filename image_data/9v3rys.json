    "description": "I have been acquiring this object since Oct 2019 and accumulated more than 200 hours data, with my old fella - EdgeHD 8 from my backyard. And the equipment makes it very very hard to finish.\r\nThe small fov requires at least 3 frames to cover the whole target. To make it nicer, it probably takes 4. What's worse is the tilting issue I have been struggling with my setup. If I didn't take it seriously as what happened to me at first, I ended up in 7 frames with 2 rotation angles and still in short of at least 50~60 hours before I could test-process it.\r\nIn the end, it became my first and last unfinished big project, before I switched the gears. I still love my old pal but it could rest for now.\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the 4th attempt to process the same target. Back on the new year's day, I acquired some more RGB data to boost the star colors. The effect is marginal. However I did fine tuned the bright stars to tame the surrounding halos as much as possible. When zooming in 500% on Tejet Posterior, I believe I can see 2-3 stars very close-by. The Propus seems to be one in loneliness.\r\n<br>\r\nKudo to Yizhou to help me find the name for the small object at the top left corner - <a href=\"http://www.horizontalheavens.com/planetarynebulaproject.htm\">HoCr-1</a>.\r\n<br>\r\n<I>#TeamNoctuaDSNM</I>",
