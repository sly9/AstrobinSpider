    "description": "This is my second target with the QHY600. I collected Ha data during the moon phase and ended up having artifacts and had to ditch almost 10 hours of Ha data. \r\n\r\nCollected about 6 hours of Ha again and once I got it into the mix and processed it, I am happy with the way this turned out in the end.  I could have done a better job at noise reduction, I guess that's something I will play around for a cloudy night!",
