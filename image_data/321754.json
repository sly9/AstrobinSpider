    "description": "Super Wide 135mm of the North American Nebula in SHO.\r\n\r\nHaving fun with the Samy 135mm set at f/2.8! :)\r\n\r\nWhen the first Ha sub came in I was shocked how much signal there was at 90\" only!\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to get my guider hooked up with my new connections, so I went unguided with a PEC and it worked.  Old school going unguided - I enjoyed it!\r\n\r\nAlso very impressed with the lens, a bit difficult for perfect focus but it seems to hold focus very well.\r\n\r\nThanks for viewing!  Clear skies and stay warm :)",
