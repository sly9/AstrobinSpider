    "description": "NGC2736, aka the Pencil Nebula or Herschel's Ray, is a small section of the Vela Supernova Remnant approximately 800 light-years from Earth in the Southern constellation of Vela.  It glows brightly due to ionised Hydrogen (red) and Oxygen (blue/green) where the shock wave from the supernova has ploughed into interstellar gas clouds.  The original, violent death of the star which went supernova took place approximately 11,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nData from Martin Pugh at Yass, Australia.",
