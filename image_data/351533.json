    "description": "Abell 35 (Sharpless 2-313)  is catalogued as a planetary nebula (PN) in the constellation of Hydra. I say \"catalogued\" here as there has been research completed from which the authors conclude that this object is not in fact a PN. Notwithstanding the research, it is an interesting object and relatively large for a PN (if that's what it is) at 16' x 11'.  It makes for a difficult object to process as the surface brightness is quite low, hence the reason for spending additional time gathering data for this one - particularly with the OIII band. There was no SII noticed to speak of so I did not spend the time gathering SII data. There is a good description of this object on the Astrodon web site via this link:  https://astrodonimaging.com/gallery/abell-35/",
