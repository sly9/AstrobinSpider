    "description": "Kronberger 63 is a planetary nebula in the constellation of Orion . It was discovered by Austrian Mattias Kronberger who is a member of the amateur group Deep Sky Hunters.\r\nIt is very faint and thus rarely imaged. Indeed my searches have found only one other image, produced by the Chart32 team in Chile.",
