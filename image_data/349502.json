    "description": "OK I made that name up but that's what I looks like to me!  IC4635 is a seldom imaged nebula very near to the Lagoon.  I think it suffers because any time this is available so is the Lagoon so why would you shoot this?  \r\n\r\nI've done a mix of SII and OIII with a little Ha added to each.  The Luminance is purely Ha.  There isn't much OIII in the nebula and I only captured 8 OIII subs.  23 Ha and 16 SII round out the 15.66 hours total integration time.",
