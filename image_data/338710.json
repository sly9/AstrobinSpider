    "description": "Hi all.\r\nHere is M33, an often overlooked object! :D\r\nJokes apart, this image was obtained with two different scopes and two different cameras, in order to achieve a wide field and an interesting resolution.\r\nTelescope used were my Equinox 120ED and my A&M (now Officina Stellare) super apo 80 mm.\r\nCameras were the usual ST8 and a Canon 450d baader mod.\r\nThe image was upscaled 2x in post processing. It's worth to explore it in full res.\r\nHope you like this rendition.\r\nCiao\r\nLorenzo",
