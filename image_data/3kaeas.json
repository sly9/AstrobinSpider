    "description": "Abell 9 is an almost never imaged plantary nebula located in Auriga.  It is easy to see why.  It is very small, only .67 arcminute in diameter, and exceptionally dim, listed at magnitude 18.9.  Individual subs of Ha and Oiii do not show a hint that anything is there. But it is.  A very interesting structure.  A prominent red horseshoe of Ha partly surrounding a uniform field of blue Oiii.  Very striking.  A worthy target if you like a challenge.",
