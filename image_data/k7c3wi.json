    "description": "SH2-112 in HS/O/O and RGB stars: in Cygnus, about 6000 light-years distant. I found this a very hard target to process even with 14 hours of data. The background is naturally mottled with gasses, which makes it difficult to pull the S-ii and O-iii channels out without making a complete mess of the background. After four passes at processing it, I finally decided to leave the background as more of a suggestion, at the cost of some variety in color in the nebula itself. I'll come back to this in 6-12 months, after I have a few more processing tricks up my sleeve but I'm reasonably happy with this rendition for now.",
