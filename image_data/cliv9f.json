    "description": "I planned on giving this another hour of red and two or three more hours of luminance, but I have no clear nights until at least April 15 unless the forecast changes and with the work slowdown, I find that I have the time to process things, so I gave it a shot. While I definitely think it would have benefited from the extra time, it's not terrible for Bortle 7-8 skies and now I can devote some clear nights to something else.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that I've had an elliptical galaxy as a main subject of an image. While this one at least has a dust lane, I have to say that they aren't the most satisfying targets to image. They're also rather difficult under brighter skies due to the fact that they get pretty dim at the edges.",
