    "description": "I did not realize the image on the day of this very favorable conjunction (6’), on the one hand due to the weather conditions, but also the low probability of obtaining something of quality due to a height on the horizon around 13 °.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, given that this event will not happen again for 60 years ...\r\nand that I wanted to immortalize it, all I had to do was make the cut as realistic as possible.\r\n\r\nSo I looked in my archives for two images of the planets with their respective satellites.\r\nAn image of Saturn taken in 2019, with a still acceptable tilt of the rings and one of Jupiter from 2017.\r\n\r\nI had to check using WinJupos for the given day and time (December 21 at 17h00 UT), the exact position of both the satellites and the two planets, then in Photoshop to carry out the assembly, respecting all the proportions.\r\n\r\nThis type of image corresponds to the result probably obtained, under excellent conditions, with a focal length of less than 1 m and using 2 or 3 panels.",
