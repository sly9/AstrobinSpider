    "description": "After receiving some comments that <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/whpk3z/I/?nc=user\" target=\"_blank\">the \"traditional\" animation for my last Jupiter capture</a> had a \"3D feel\" to it, I began to wonder what an animated series of 3D stereo images  may look like. Here is the result.\r\n\r\nThe original image is a single 3D stereo image, whereas Rev # is an animated GIF. \r\n\r\nThese are \"cross-eyed\" stereo images, i.e. you will need to cross your eyes until the two images overlap and focus on the result. If you're viewing using an external monitor, you may want to sit back from the screen a little to make this more comfortable.\r\n\r\nAs I have commented previously, GIF is a very old format designed for very simple graphics with solid colours - it does not handle gradients well at all.\r\n\r\nThere is a much better, newer format: Animated PNG. The only problem: this format has limited browser support at this time. Depending on your operating system and browser (I'm using Win 10 and Google Chrome) if you visit the link below and then click on the image, you may be able to see a much higher quality animation. I don't believe it will work on mobile devices.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudynights.com/gallery/image/96702-jupiter-2020-06-02-3d-stereo-animated-png/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cloudynights.com/gallery/image/96702-jupiter-2020-06-02-3d-stereo-animated-png</a>\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
