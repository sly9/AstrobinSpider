    "description": "Rarely do I delete an image completely and begin again.  I think it was warranted in this case, and apologies to all those who left thoughtful comments about the previous images.  I was able to bring out much more Ha emissions across the galaxy in this attempt, and I had a much tighter control of the deconvolution process, which resulted in a lack of artifacts  that were previously quite visible.   I find it amazing that what took me many hours to accomplish before was done in about an hour this time.  I can't help but think that an image is much to a sketch pad--the more one erases the pencil strokes, the less able the paper is to render an image.  Sometimes one must just start over.\r\n\r\nAn HaLRGB composition that benefited from a rare streak of good seeing.  Not often do I achieve FWHM values of 1.5 arcsec/pix, let alone accomplish this over all filters in an image.  This image, strangely enough, is best viewed at full resolution",
