    "description": "I would have liked/expected the DSLR to have been more \"productive\" in capturing the Hydrogen clouds (specially of IC1396 and Sh2-129) of this zone. I guess that I am getting spoilt by the results of H-alpha from the ZWO mono camera and that I will have to buy an adapter for the 135mm and the ZWO.... but in this case I wouldnt be able to be doing parallel sessions of Telescope and widefield with the 135mm.... ok then I'll be getting another asi1600 so i can capture with the scope and the widefield in parallel...hmm this vicious circle is worrying...\r\n\r\n Anyway the canon did a good job capturing the dark nebulae and the starfield. \r\n\r\nDuring the session high clouds rolled in and difuse some of the subs. I decided not to discard them in order to get a some halo around some stars, I like them in the starfields.  \r\n\r\nI guess that at some point I will retake this data and combine with new data coming from mono camera with h-alpha and OIII....but that will be another story!\r\n\r\nBest skies !",
