    "description": "Last night 20171222 there was a spectacular visual treat with the Falcon 9 launch from Vandenburg AFB about an hour after sunset. We know this could turn out dramatic. A good friend and I have been watching these launches for years. This one tops them all. Fortunately, we were able to arrive and setup, focus and test about 15 min prior to launch time.\r\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite of the bunch (many turned out very well). This is the main payload section with the second stage falling off and waxing crescent moon.\r\n\r\nIt is amazing what we can do with modern equipment and a little bit of experience and planning.",
