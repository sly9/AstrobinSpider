    "description": "The 2019 Transit of Mercury-  Captured with my Calcium K filters+ Hydrogen Alpha  Solar Telescope.  Taken at Cloudland Canyon State Park with the Barnard Astronomical Society of Chattanooga, November 11th, 2019.\r\n\r\nImage explanation: 10 second video and single images were collected every minute during the 5 hour event.  We were lucky to have the ingress and egress visible from our location.  I have some very nice video of birds flying in front of the sun with Mercury making it's ingress.  Throughout the morning until 11 a.m. we enjoyed clear skies, with intermittent clouds persisting until egress.  While editing, clouds kept filling the background stacks so I left them.  The transit data is a stack of  the best single frames out of 250gb of data! \r\n\r\nIt's a wild looking photo, but should be pretty accurate to the data collected.  Northern orientation is correct in the photo with the Ingress taking place on the Eastern Limb of the Sun and Egress on the Western Limb.",
