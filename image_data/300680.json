    "description": "Visually, this was such a dazzling display it is so hard to do it justice.   This image was created as a composite of sorts.   I was taking exposures for a milky way time-lapse from the beautifully dark skies on the shores of Lake Huron.   As predicted, this Iridium Flare literally lit up the skies like a flashlight beam to the eye at a estimated magnitude of -7.   \r\n\r\nThe background image is a single 12 second exposure with 6 segments blended together to complete the satellite trail.   The foreground was unintentionally illuminated by some magenta LED lighting off-camera.   Off in the distance is some relatively minor light pollution from Oscoda, MI.\r\n",
