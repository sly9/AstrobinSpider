    "description": "LRGB: 4: 1.9: 1.8: 1.9 hours. One of my first really distant images. 300 million light years. These 2 galaxies are interacting with each other causing galactic distortions mostly seen in the larger galaxy with one arm reaching all around. Still would like to get more data and better seeing but somewhat happy with this one.",
