    "description": "With cloud about I made these two captures of Mars about 45 minutes apart. By the time of the second capture it was substantially daylight. The mouse over shows the daylight image. I quite like the red-orange colour of Mars against the blue sky. \r\nOnce again there is extensive cloud over the south polar region and partially obscuring the Hellas Basin. The Mare Tyrrhenium is central and Utopia Planitia can be seen to the north. There are quite thick clouds over Elysium Mons.",
