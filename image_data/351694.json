    "description": "If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it!\r\nAverage seeing, but image turned out quite okay... it was a bit rough around the edges initially, but some noise reduction made a world of difference. You can barely make out the hexagonal polar storm, and a bit of the C rings if you look closely enough. Pretty happy with these results considering I'm new to planetary imaging and taking the average seeing into account.",
