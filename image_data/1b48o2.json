    "description": "The spider-shaped gas cloud is actually an emission nebula labelled IC 417, while the smaller fly-shaped cloud is dubbed NGC 1931 and is both an emission nebula and a reflection nebula. About 10,000 light-years distant, both nebulas harbor young, open star clusters. For scale, the more compact NGC 1931 (Fly) is about 10 light-years across.",
