    "description": "A few firsts for me with this one:-\r\n1. First narrowband image, using a dedicated Mono camera, the amazing ZWO 1600MM Pro - thanks to jlangston_astro  for allowing me to borrow it!\r\n2. First processing of HOO - really enjoyed it! Big milestones: learning to use Masked Stretch and Pixel Math, both of which are a bit tough to get your head around, but well worthwhile.\r\n3. First target using off-axis guiding. A bit of overkill for a small, wide refractor, but excellent training for bigger and narrower scopes in years to come.\r\n\r\nAll of the above were extremely worthwhile, I definitely feel like I'm growing as an astrophotographer, can't wait to get on to the next projects.",
