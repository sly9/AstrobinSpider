    "description": "The Cresent Nebula, NGC6888, is an emission nebula in the constilation Cygnus. It was formed from the steller wind of the Wolf-Rayet star WR 136 (HD 192163﻿﻿﻿﻿) colliding with the steller wind of other nearby stars, and thus creating two shock waves, one moving out, and one moving in.\r\n\r\n ﻿\r\n\r\nMy image is composed of 9 hours of Oxygen III, and 5 hours of Hydrogen Alpha, captured at F7, combined in an HOO color combination.﻿﻿﻿",
