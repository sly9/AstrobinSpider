    "description": "The Prawn in Hubble Palette (SHO), was a good target to test out my focuser backlash compensation. Worked pretty well and was able to consistently achieve the V curve throughout the imaging and refocusing process routine in SGP. Unfortunately limited clear skies opportunity and visibility only 2-3 hours a night before it disappears behind the house. After a couple of nights decided to see what I can pull out with my first attempt using PixInsight.
