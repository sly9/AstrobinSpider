    "description": "Experiment using MaskedStretch for L and ArcSinH to stretch RGB.  Then combine with LRGBCombination.\r\n\r\nYou end up with some color - lots of color.  It preserved the color all right - WAY too much color.  Stars ended up with strong halos.  I cleaned it up with some masked HueSaturation in PS but in the end I think it is too much for my tastes.  I prefer a more reserved \"natural\" look.\r\n\r\nI don't think ArcSinH was the problem.  I just need to be more refined in my use of the tools.  I also need to understand why the combined RGB frames have asymmetric halos.  Probably something to do with some of the color obtained on one side of the meridian and some on the other. \r\n",
