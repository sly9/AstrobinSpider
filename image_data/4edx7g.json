    "description": "What happens when a massive star ignites within a dense cloud of hydrogen gas? This kind of thing.\r\n\r\nAs the bright star within the Bubble Nebula began nuclear fusion, the radiation surged outward and carved out this little enclave of space.\r\n\r\nI was working on this image and left the this mix on my desktop as an intermediate step. When I came back to the computer, I thought it looked pretty cool in its own right, cropped way in to the center. Though shot in narrowband, this is HOO palette loosely represents the true color of this object.\r\n\r\nI thought it had a very natural look to it.  But, Iâ€™ll end up spinning this picture a few ways.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
