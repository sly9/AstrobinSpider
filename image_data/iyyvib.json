    "description": "Shelob lies in wait, anticipating the harmonious twang as her next meal becomes entrapped in her web. You can see the remains of a small scorpion to her left, a previous meal.\r\n\r\nThe Tarantula nebula is a massive HII region within the Large Magellanic Cloud. The weather was briefly good here and the seeing was exceptional. This is 6 hours of SHO data captured from my backyard. Hopefully the weather will clear again so I can continue to capture photons of this beautiful region of space.\r\n\r\nI am still playing around with the framing on this one and finding my own way of applying Eric Coles tone mapping techniques. I also decided to use all of the Ha data as luminance rather than being overly selective, the moderate loss in sharpness is more than made up for in my eyes by the drastic reduction in background noise.\r\n\r\nI am still hoping to capture much more OIII and SII data in the coming months, as the Ha stack looks good now.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you think I'm barking up the wrong tree in terms of my luminance and colour palette as compared to Mark 2.",
