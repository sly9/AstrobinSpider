    "description": "SH2-240 - The Spaghetti Nebula\r\n\r\nSimeis 147, also known as the Spaghetti Nebula, SNR G180.0-01.7 or Sharpless 2-240, is a supernova remnant (SNR) in the Milky Way, straddling the border between the constellations Auriga and Taurus. Discovered in 1952 at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory using a 25-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, it is difficult to observe due to its extremely low brightness.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that after its stellar explosion a rapidly spinning neutron star known as pulsar PSR J0538+2817 was left behind in the nebula core, emitting a strong radio signal.\r\n\r\n2 panel mosaic and first light with the 294mm.\r\n\r\nEquipment\r\n@williamoptics RedCat 51\r\n@zwoasi 294mm, 224MC, 30mm Guide Scope, ASIAIR PRO \r\nAstronomik HA & OIIIFilters @skywatcherusa EQ6-R Mount\r\n\r\nAcquisition\r\nHA - 54x600” - 9hrs\r\nOIII - 54x600” - 9hrs\r\n-18 Total Integration Time\r\n-50 Darks & 50 Flats per session\r\n-Gain 120\r\n-Temp-20c\r\n-Bortle 5",
