    "description": "Lots of active star forming areas near the Large Magellanic Cloud taken November 2020 in SHO. Most people turn their attention to the Tarantula nebula for obvious reasons but there are so many other areas of interest that are nearby. I decided to centre on NGC2004 which is a tiny star cluster in the centre of the frame. This gave me the best vantage point to capture the cosmic reef which comprises NGC2014 and NGC2020. NGC2020 is a Hii area surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star. To the right is NGC2035 which is an active star forming region which also contains filaments from past supernova explosions - highlighting the relationship between the death and rebirth stars. To the left is another star forming region with lots of small star clusters. Indeed, the whole frame is full of small star clusters containing newly born stars.",
