    "description": "My first total eclipse. Needless to say, that was truly amazing! \r\n\r\nThere is nothing really to add here, hope you will enjoy this picture!\r\n\r\nInteresting effect is that each bead starts with a green flash. I am not sure why - is this real or some weird artifact of my equipment. Didn't find anyone mentioning such effect.\r\n\r\nPS. Star Adventurer at 1m focal length is tolally possible, but tricky. Both axes should be perfectly balanced!",
