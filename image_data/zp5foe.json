    "description": "This is a Hubble Palette version of an image that I posted last week as a “natural narrowband” rendition (posted here as Version B). The background information remains the same (https://www.astrobin.com/yofxqd/?nc=user). I collected the narrowband data in February 2019 and recently discovered RGB data collected at the same time, but was never used. This is a complete re-processing of the original data, now with RGB stars, as well as the benefit nearly 18 months of improved processing skills, especially in noise control and structural detail.\r\n\r\nI’m a bit torn between these two renditions. While I really like the iridescent glow of the simple warm red and cool blue “natural” version, this more colorful version reveals wonderful structural detail of this dynamic nebula. What is your preference? Have you taken different processing approach that you favor?",
