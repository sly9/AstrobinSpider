    "description": "I have added 90 minutes of RGB for each panel to my Luminance to give a total 20 hours.\r\n\r\nAn epic PixInsight mosaic merge and refinement of the RGB data.  I took a chance and processed as I will not be able to return to this project for some time.\r\n\r\nIntegration LRGB data collected over many weeks so the date above is the process date. \r\n\r\n\"Integrated Flux Nebulae is the term coined to describe high galactic latitude nebulae that are illuminated not by a single star (as most nebula in the plane of the Galaxy are) but by the energy from the integrated flux of all the stars in the Milky Way. These nebulae clouds, an important component of the Interstellar Medium, are composed of dust particles, hydrogen and carbon monoxide and other elements. The dust is scattering blue light and is fluorescing a broad red spectrum of light known as the Extended Red Emission (ERE) that adds an additional broad-band emission to the red part of the spectrum. Therefore, on color images there are both blue and red components creating beautiful and interesting images. The dust clouds were known but the beautiful nebulae within them were not, and these are the first images of them.\" From the Mandel-Wilson Catalogue of Unexplored Nebulae, Steve Mandel.\r\n\r\nC&Cs always welcome.",
