    "description": "Here we have a ring nebula being shaped by the incredibly hot temperatures of Wolf Rayet 75.\r\n\r\nI used all three narrowband channels for this image. My first attempt was based on the Hubble Palette, but I was never happy with the result. This attempt used an entirely different approach. I first put together six versions of the image, using all possible combinations of Ha, OIII and SII. In addition, I used Pixelmath to create a “realistic” version with reasonable star colors. The palette that worked best for the nebula was HOS, which I used for the rest of my processing. Downstream, I transferred the stars from the realistic version into the HOS image.\r\n\r\nVery few images of RCW 104 exist. That’s surprising, for such an interesting object.\r\n\r\nTech Notes:\r\nASA Newtonian, 500 mm aperture, 1900mm focal length, F3.6\r\nFLI Proline 16803, 9 mm pixel, 4096 X 4096\r\nASA DDM85 equatorial mount\r\nProcessing with PixInsight and Affinity Photo",
