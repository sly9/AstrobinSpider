    "description": "This image was taken at the 440 Ranch, Shoshoni, Wyoming, using an SVQ100, Nikon D800, and Celestor AVX mount .  I was able to camp on site the night before, and polar aligned the mount that night.  This image is composed of 6 frames (exposures 1/500,  1/125, 1/30, 1/8, ¼, and ½ seconds).  I used the Russell Brown method to process.  Eclipsed Orchestrator would not work the day of the eclipse (I have had intermittent problems with the software not tripping the shutter, and have to restore the drive to get it to work again), so I went to the backup plan of using BackYard Nikon.   Backyard Nikon worked as designed, but it’s very slow for this application.   The images were processed in Photoshop CS 5.5 Extended, with minor edits in Lightroom 4.   I have additional frames at these shutter speeds and at 2 seconds and 4 seconds, and I am working on incorporating them in new images.",
