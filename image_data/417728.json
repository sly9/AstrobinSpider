    "description": "I am very happy to have gotten a surprise clear night (at least for a few hours) - the first one this summer - where it didn't rain hours earlier or the moon wasn't out. I started this back in May. It was bad transparency every single time, par for the course in Florida this time of year. It probably doesn't help this is fairly low and toward the Tampa light dome to my north. All in all, with the environmental factors working against me, I am quite happy with the outcome.",
