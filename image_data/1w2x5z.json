    "description": "NGC 7793 is located in the constellation Sculptor and is one of the brightest galaxies within the Sculptor Group of galaxies.  It is classed as a flocculent spiral galaxy.   Flocculent spirals tend to be more patchy, fluffy looking, with discontinuous arms.  They don’t have that well defined spiral architecture found in the grand design spiral classification.   About 30% of spirals fall within the flocculent classification.\r\n\r\nIt has an apparent size of 9’.3 X 6’.3 arcmin, and brightness of magnitude of 10.0, and 2.7 million light-years distant. \r\n\r\nI have always found flocculent galaxies difficult to process.  They tend to look spotty, speckled, and soft.  There is nothing to really lock on to and dig in to reveal details.  Their colours are always demanding as well.  I managed to collect a reasonable amount of Ha to help lift those interesting areas in galaxies, hopefully adding another level of depth to the result.\r\n\r\nInstruments:\r\n10 Inch fl 9.1 RCOS\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\nRed 16 X 450 Sec Bin 2    2 Hours\r\nGreen 16 X 450 Bin 2       2 Hours\r\nBlue 16 X 450 Sec Bin 2   2 Hours\r\nLum 42 X 900 Bin 1         10.5 Hours\r\nHa 31 X 1200 Bin 1          10.3 Hours\r\n\r\nTotal Exposure Time:    26.8 Hours",
