    "description": "M13 was discovered by Edmond Halley in 1714.  It is about 145 light-years in diameter, and it is composed of several hundred thousand stars.  M13 is 22,200 light-years away from Earth.\r\n\r\nOnly telescopes with a great light-gathering capability can best show the Hercules Globular Cluster. M13 is not clearly visible to the naked eye. With a low-power telescope, the Messier 13 looks like a comet. The cluster can be seen all year long, on some nights more than others. However, in the months of August and September it brightens the sky for a longer period of time.  \r\n\r\nA globular cluster is a spherical collection of stars that orbits a galactic core as a satellite. Globular clusters are very tightly bound by gravity, which gives them their spherical shapes and relatively high stellar densities toward their centers.\r\n\r\nGlobular clusters are found in the spherical halo of a galaxy and contain considerably more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters, which are found in the disk of a galaxy. Globular clusters are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular clusters in the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered.\r\n\r\nAlthough it appears that globular clusters contain some of the first stars to be produced in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear.  Of the globular clusters within the Milky Way, most are found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority are located in the celestial sky centered \"above\" the core.
