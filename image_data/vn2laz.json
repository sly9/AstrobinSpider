    "description": "Probably one of the best seeing conditions I have ever seen...but very poor transparency due to clouds. I haven't been very lucky with planetary imaging this year and this might have been the last chance to image one of my favorite planets. Despite the conditions, globe is well resolved and the hexagon is clearly visible. Rings were very much affected by the poor transparency. I am happy about the overall result though. Ad maiora.",
