    "description": "This is data from a week we spent with Olly Penrice at Les Granges.  We had a few technical difficulties, and I did not take a careful note of every sub, hence the technical card is not complete.  [One of these difficulties involved a filter-wheel failure which resulted in us shooting Lum when we thought we were getting RGB!!  I suppose it meant that we did get 14 hours of Lum.]  \r\n\r\nThe data come mostly from Olly's dual Takahashi FSQ 106 rig during the week 18-24 November 2017.   We did get some Lum data from his TEC 140 and a QSI 683 for detail around the star cluster.  Unfortunately the QSI was showing some banding issues, so I had to be careful about what could be included in the final image.\r\n\r\nThis is:\r\n\r\nLum: 14 hours in 15 minute exposures\r\nRGB: 14 hours in 15 minute exposures\r\nHa: 8 hours in 30 minute exposures\r\n\r\nA total of 36 hours (plus a few hours from the TEC).\r\n\r\nIC 348 is a star-forming region around 1,000 light years distant in the constellation Perseus.  The light from the cluster is scattered by clouds of dust.  This reflection nebula is believed to be about 15 light years across.",
