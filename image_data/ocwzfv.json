    "description": "The second dawn of april was amazing in Hungary. Not even a single cloud, just the hyper clear skies. However the temperature was below 0Â°C, but the equipment like that. \r\n\r\nNear my remote observatory was a lake in a walley and I decided to try a new photograph techology called \"tracked pano\". \r\n\r\nNot bad, but the sky is almost great, maybe one of the best skies of the year in Hungary.",
