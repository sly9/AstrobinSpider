    "description": "NGC 1055 is an edge-on spiral galaxy located in the constellation Cetus. It has a percular dark lane of dust and gas that appears to be elevated above the galaxy's plane, almost blending away from the central plane.  If you look carefully, several bright Ha areas can be easily seen.\r\n\r\nThe galaxy is fairly small in my instrument as it is only has an apparent size of 7'.6 × 2'.7 arc min.  NGC 155 is 52 million light years away, and has a diameter of about 115,800 light years across.  The apparent size is 7.6 X 2.7 arc min with an apparent magnitude of 11.4.  It’s a fairly dramatic looking galaxy with an incredible glow around it. \r\n\r\nNow for the inner geek stuff.  The guiding is performed with a SBIG Remote guide head.  It may be old, by it’s really a nice bit of kit having its own shutter and TEC cooler.  The chip measures 4.86 X 3.66 mm in size, giving it a field of view of 7.31 by 5.5 arc minutes.  Normally I struggle to find a guide star to place on the guide chip.  So, it’s fairly small, but in this case, the galaxy presented would fit diagonally on the guide chip.   Hopefully, this helps to convey the size of this galaxy shown above.   It's so cool to think that this galaxy would just squeeze onto the guide chip of this rig.  :)\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\n\r\nLum 35X900  \r\nRed 26X450\r\nGreen 16X450\r\nBlue 16X450  \r\nHa 17X1800   \r\nTotal time 24.5 hours\r\n\r\nInstruments Used:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nSoftware Used\r\n\r\nCCDStack (calibration, alignment, data rejection, stacking)\r\nPhotoshop CS 6 (Image processing)\r\n\r\nThanks for looking",
