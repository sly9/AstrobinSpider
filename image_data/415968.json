    "description": "Hi! Hope you enjoy two kind of little more \"unusual\" Hubble pictures:\r\n\r\nNGC 3603 (near of Statue of Liberty Nebula - NGC 3576) - five different filters to deal with: infrared F164n (FeII) and F128n (Paschen Beta), F673n (SII), F656n (Ha but good for OIII :-)) and F555w (V), but I have to make three different images with different filters; \"nice\" colors and \"fair\" star shapes are the most difficult things to achieve here...I think the final result looks like some picture extracted from a Sci-Fi Comic Book :-)\r\n\r\nThe other image was stored at my \"Staging Area\", and I think worth be published, because is inspired at Steven Marx image at the early year of 2013 - >\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/28672/?nc=user\r\n...its NGC 2440, a planetary nebula !\r\n\r\nHope you guys and girls appreciate these curious images ...and Im really sorry to publish only processed attempts of Hubble Images these days !!!",
