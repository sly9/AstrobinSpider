    "description": "This is a 2-panel mosaic of Andromeda which I took from 3 different locations in two states and it is one of my most extensive projects to date. I started this from a local Bortle 2 Star Party which was hastily organized at the end of August where I captured Luminance, captured the RGB and Ha (7nm) from my Bortle 4 home, and finally ended the project with another night of Luminance at the OkieTex Star Party in late September. My primary motivation in shooting this as a mosaic was avoidance of yet another generic diagonal M31 image - I think giving the galaxy some framing on all sides just looks better.\r\n\r\nChallenges associated with this project can be found by following the attached link to my website Astronewton.com, but I will say here that, as with every other new imaging project, I learned a lot. Unfortunately my experimentation in new techniques led to an extensive delay between image capture and releasing this final image.\r\n\r\nPre-Processing:\r\n - Darks & Flats Calibration, Cosmic Correction\r\n - Subframe Selection & Local Normalization\r\n - Star Align of all channels to the best Ha frame of each panel\r\n - 2x Drizzle Integration\r\n\r\nHousekeeping:\r\n - Common Crop per panel\r\n - Combined into Mosaic per Light Vortex Tutorials page\r\n - Second crop\r\n - DBE for each channel\r\n - RGB Combine\r\n - Photometric Color Calibration\r\n - HDR combine of 240s, 120s into Master Light channel (also used Ha image for finer core detail)\r\n \r\nHa+R & L:\r\n - Copied Ha image, ran STF stretch\r\n - Starnet to remove stars, creation of Star Mask\r\n - Erosion and removal of stars on Linear Ha image\r\n - Isolation of Ha from Red Continuum, addition to Red channel using PixelMath\r\n - Background Neutralization of HaRGB\r\n - Same process for adding isolated Hydrogen to Luminance master\r\n\r\nMain Processing:\r\n - HSV Repair on HaRGB\r\n - TGVD, MMT noise reduction (Jon Rista method) on HaRGB, L\r\n - SCNR for removing excessive green\r\n\r\nNon-Linear:\r\n - ArcSinH for L, HaRGB\r\n - Histogram Transformation to match Histogram peaks\r\n - LRGB Combine\r\n\r\nFine Tuning, or quite literally about 100 varying Curves, HDRMT, Histogram changes to correct:\r\n - Addition of HDR detail into the brighter core using dust lane mask to preserve core luminosity)\r\n - Masked brightening of larger pixel scale dust (per Inside PixInsight book)\r\n - Color correction to \"cool\" Blue tones, turn pinkish Ha highlights more Red, and careful increase of color\r\n - Finally, MT for star reduction",
