    "description": "Located 75 million light years away in the constellation of Sextans, NGC 3169 is a spiral galaxy with tightly wound arms and an unusual halo. The galaxy is a Liner 2 galaxy with extended X-ray emissions indicating an active nucleus. \r\nNGC 3169 is located only 160,000 light years from NGC 3166 and there is significant interaction  between them which has warped the disc of NGC 3166. The third smaller galaxy NGC 3256 forms part of the group. All three are contained within an extended ring of neutral hydrogen emanating from 3169.\r\nImaged on our Officina Stellare RiDK 700 in LRGB at Obstech, Chile.\r\nImage Processing:  Mike Selby \r\nSystem control Software: Voyager by Leonardo Orazi",
