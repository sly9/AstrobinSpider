    "description": "First light with my 8\" F4 ONTC Newtonian with the Televue Paracorr FF which increases FL to 920mm.  Nice to have a fast scope at a darker site than the previous location (it's SQM 21.1 here).\r\n\r\nData was acquired between Feb 27, 2020 and Apr 21, 2020.\r\n\r\nCalibrated and stacked with AstroPixelProcessor, processed in PixInsight.",
