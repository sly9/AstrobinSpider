    "description": "This was my first sight of the aurora. I took this back in 2015 after a friend of mine asked if I wanted to try and capture the aurora during a solar storm. Not really knowing what to expect, I figured I would capture something distant on the horizon. My only \"night\" lens was a Rokinon 14mm f2.8 so I didn't expect to capture much. After I scrapped my jaw off the floor I was astonished to find my 14mm on a FF not wide enough....\r\n\r\nImage details:\r\nCanon 6d\r\nRokinon 14mm 2.8 @ (I think) 2.8\r\nISO 2000\r\n20sec",
