    "description": "This is a small portion of the expansive supernova remnant in Vela. \r\nAround 11,000 years ago a giant star violently ended its life, this dim remnant is the ghostly remains of an extremely energetic explosion. \r\n\r\nTravelled to dark skies (the Astronomical Society of Victoria's Leon Mow dark sky site) and imaged this target over 4 nights. It was a trip I will not forget! \r\n\r\nThis is a HOO image with RGB stars.",
