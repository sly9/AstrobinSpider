    "description": "When I went outside tonight I had no idea what I was going to image.  However I was not going to\r\nwaste a clear night.  I looked around for a little while and even viewed some open clusters\r\nthrough my eye piece.   Finally I noticed M45.  It was in a good location to image and it is one\r\nof my favorite objects to image.   I also enjoy processing an image of M45.   So with all of that\r\nsaid please enjoy my most recent image of M45.",
