    "description": "Hello everybody. I present a crop of my recent picture I took thanks to a long good weather period in March in Poland. We all sit at home now due to pandemic, so this was also easier to manage the time. It is my first complete one after my recent RASA 11\" collimation. This is no resize, 100% of original with scale 0,79 arcsec/pix unguided. I'll be presenting shortly also the full original frame for this picture without cropping. This area is just one sea of galaxies in the very deep background.",
