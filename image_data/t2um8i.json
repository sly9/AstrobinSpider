    "description": "Hello Friends,\r\n\r\nThis time some DS object again. I had collected the data during 5 nights with moonlight, thin clouds and no real darkness. But surprisingly the data was excellent. All structures were visible and the core was not saturated, but: I have tried more than a dozens of approaches to process the core and the rest: I have read books, tutorials and watched YouTube hints. But none of them worked out. After more than two weeks tinkering around, I have decided to accept what I have got. Next object will definitely an easier one. \r\nBut as always: You learn most from the hard ones. \r\n\r\nPlease enjoy!\r\nRÃ¼diger",
