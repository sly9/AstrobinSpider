    "description": "I've acquired around 50% of the data for this mosaic.  I'm not getting into a hurry as I hope to present a rich and smooth representation of this ancient supernova remnant.  I plan to shoot 6 panels and capture the entire Cygnus Loop.  I'm really liking the color I've managed to capture over the last few months.  This is a span of two panels to complete the structure in Cygnus.  \r\n\r\nImage statistics: \r\nL-   20 x 180s\r\nR-   20 x 180s\r\nG-   20 x 180s\r\nB-   20 x 180s \r\nHA- 20 x 600s \r\nO3- 20 x 600s\r\n\r\nMaking it around 10.5 hours per panel at present.  Image acquired during July and August in Marathon Texas.",
