    "description": "The Carnival of the Animals (Le carnaval des animaux) is a humorous musical suite of fourteen movements by the French Romantic composer Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns. \r\n\r\nMany interesting carnival creatures can be seen in this cosmic bouquet in the Large Magellenic Cloud in Dorado. N83 resembles an Arachnid, N81 is a Hermit Crab, NGC 1727 is a Baby Octopus, DEM L36 is a Bird of Prey. Cookie monster can be seen far right, and N185 is an upturned snail.\r\n\r\nIn this, the youngest part of the LMC complex, Testor & Lortet report the discovery of unevolved O stars in N83 and N84 noting the high degree of fragmentation of the ionized gas first suspected from nebular morphology and excitation. \r\n\r\nRarely (if ever?) imaged in isolation, this remarkable collection of interesting nebulae are located East of the famous Tarantula Nebula NGD 2070. Viewers with a keen eye will also see not less than a dozen tiny star clusters in this field.\r\n\r\nPhotographed from lockdown central, Melbourne, Australia.",
