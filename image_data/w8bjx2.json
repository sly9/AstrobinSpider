    "description": "Very active galaxy with some evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole, NGC1313 shows many regions of bluish star formation. A large number of supershell nebulae are also visible. This is the reason why the galaxy NGC 1313, 15 million light years away, is classified as a nearby star galaxy. It is a galaxy in formation transition between magellanic-type galaxies and normal disk galaxies such as M33.",
