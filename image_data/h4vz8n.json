    "description": "This is the first light of a GSO 12\" Ritchey-Chr√©tien. Acquisition time was limited as there has been constant poor weather here since the beginning of the year, but I was keen to see how the system performed. Collimation of the scope was pretty good right out of the box. I'm glad I didn't try to collimate it before this test, as a look through the collimation scope led me to believe it was severely miscollimated - the mechanical centers of the mirrors and baffle tubes looked badly misaligned.\r\n\r\nHowever, this image shows some mild astigmatism and coma around the edges of the frame (which I ended up cropping out for framing purposes anyway). A few delicate tweaks on the next clear night will hopefully bring everything into perfect alignment.",
