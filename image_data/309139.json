    "description": "I don't know what to say, though so much is attached to this single image.   Obviously the internet is flooded with snapshots of this event but for me, personally, this image embodies many different emotions.    I was able to witness the event with my father and we went through a significant ordeal just to enable this.  Against all odds, we were able to enjoy the eclipse and I came away with some very decent images.    \r\n\r\nBy looking through my totality shots, I was able to observe the extreme dynamic range of almost 10,000:1.   Trying to squash that into a single image is no small feat and, furthermore, duplicating what you can physically see is likely impossible.    Though, I did have a few naked-eye impressions that I worked to preserve here. \r\n\r\nI'll be posting up some more, hopefully, in the near future.   \r\n\r\nImages were shot with a Canon 6D through a Sigma 150-600mm f/5-6.3 DG OS HSM Contemporary at 600mm and f/8.     The ten exposures ranged from 2s to 1/4000s.   Controlled using live view via WiFi on my iPhone.     I was not able to script via a computer, but this method allowed me mobility to enjoy the view while changing exposure.  \r\n\r\nI processed this entirely in Photoshop using per-layer luminance masking, and high pass filter contrast enhancement.   I may go back at some point and try the HDR compositing in PI.   One of the more significant challenges was to keep the inner reaches of the corona tame so that the prominences were visible.   \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n",
