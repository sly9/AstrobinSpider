    "description": "A supernova remnant about a full moon of apparent size in the constellation of Cassiopeia. It is a very faint object as it was challenging in terms of planning, acquisition and processing.\r\n\r\nPlanning:\r\nI originally started imaging this target earlier in July, but after my camera died on me, I restarted this target 2 months later with a different chip size, thus a re-framing was in need. After checking several sky surveys for this matter, I landed on a vertical field of view, where the nebula was conceived to appear rising above a hill of dark nebulosity. Later to notice that this hill was actually an undocumented nebula, and a candidate for a new supernova remnant (see the filaments and ribbons at the bottom of the frame).\r\n\r\nAcquisition:\r\nI went berserk mode on this target after noticing the nebulosity at the bottom, I planned for 100 hours but ended up with only 82, including 10 minutes length of exposures. I dropped 30% of those frames, but this helped me solve multiple issues with my setup including 3 sources of differential flexure (hint for future plans: OAG). \r\nWill I go full berserk mode after a target again? Probably yes, but not anytime soon for a faint one. \r\n\r\nProcessing:\r\nProbably the most challenging target I have processed, it involved using Gaussian Blur in some parts for noise reduction that I am not proud of, but I learned different new techniques during this process. \r\n\r\nUnder the hood:\r\niOptron CEM70, TMB92SS, ZWO ASI1600mm pro, 290mm mini, 60mm Orion guidescope\r\nHii: 252x600s (42 hours) \r\nOiii: 480x300s (40 hours) \r\nSoftware: SGP, Phd2, Sharpcap, Pixinsight, Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom CS5\r\nCredits: Daniel Caracache for lending me his mono camera and filterwheel set \r\nLocation: The MVST Observatory (Moophz' Very Small Telescope)",
