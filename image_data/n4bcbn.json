    "description": "NGC 247 is an intermediate spiral galaxy seen nearly edge-on about 11 million light-years away in the constellation Cetus.\r\nNGC 247 is a member of the Sculptor Group and may be bound gravitationally to NGC 253. NGC 247 is marred by an unusually large void on one side of its spiral disk.\r\nThis void contains some older, redder stars but no younger, bluer stars. The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 9.9 but has a low surface brightness of 23.4 mag/arcsec2.\r\n\r\nDue to it's relatively close position it is resolved in many single stars und showing nice H-Alpha areas and dust lanes. A huge number of faint and faintest background galaxies can be spotted.",
