    "description": "The project started in Sept 2014, imaged again in 2015 July to October and again in 2016 July to Aug. It has taken a long time to process as it was my first mosaic and I was still learning. This is built up from Ha, OIII, SII, Red, Green & Blue filtered data totalling 89.92 hrs\r\n\r\nThe main aim of this image is to show the detail in the dust covering this region. The central area of dust is designated L935 a large dark molecular cloud which divides NGC 7000 & IC 5070.\r\n\r\nThe basic colour pallet is based on the initial Pixelmath:\r\nR = (ha*0.5)+(sii*0.5)\r\nG = (oiii*0.85)+(ha*0.15)\r\nB = (oiii*1)\r\nBut was then adapted to personal taste during processing. The RGB data was only used for the stars.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of sub exposures and bin settings used, so I have averaged out the exposure lengths in the technical card.\r\n\r\nI have also posted a crop of the wall area <a HREF=\"http://www.astrobin.com/300747/B/\">here </a> which is at twice the resolution.",
