    "description": "NGC 4945 is a large barred spiral galaxy only 12 million light-years away in the constellation of Centaurus. James Dunlop, a Scottish astronomer, is credited with originally discovering NGC 4945 from Australia in 1826. \r\n\r\nUnlike most galaxies, NGC4945 has its own song performed by Brett Domino.\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyoIE_ukwcQ\">NGC 4945 song</a>\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's worse ... my image, or the music video. \r\nI'll let you decide, but it is good to see someone having fun.\r\n\r\nThe lowest point is probably verse 2, if you get that far:\r\n... I'm gonna see her so I'm gonna send a rocket up\r\n...  Hotline to NASA because I don't want to cock it up\r\n...  Sucked in by your supernova gravity\r\n...  Getting hot like black hole entropy\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
