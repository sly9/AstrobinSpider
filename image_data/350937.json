    "description": "I had a window of opportunity to go to a dark site an hour away on Mount Donna Buang. At 1250m, I was hoping to get above the damp valleys for better imaging. So filling in time waiting for a midnight target to rise in the sky, I ran a few images off of M83 to tweak the guiding for later. I had great guiding all within a 2 arc sec range on this moonless and windless night. It was just below zero C and the humidity was lower than normal.  Everything fell into place to run off 19 shots  of the Southern Pinwheel. The low humidity and cold sensor temp (for a DSLR) helped in revealing more detail than I expected.    Later the wind picked up and my planned target was not available for me in the end.  Astro photography is much like going fishing. You never know what  you will catch!",
