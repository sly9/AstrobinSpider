    "description": "Jupiter with GRS, Oval BA and Europa shadow on the morning of Fri 19 Jun 2020 AEST.\r\n\r\nImaged Jupiter and Mars in consistently good seeing conditions. Temperature hit -1 Â°C at the time of this capture. The planet is now 46.5\", surpassing last year's opposition and continues to grow. It will reach 47.6\" next month, with the closest approach on 14 July.\r\n\r\nMore and more detail starts to become resolved in both polar regions and temperate belts, the GRS and Oval BA also exhibit some internal structure. This is a 12 minute derotation covering time window between 2:31 and 2:43 am Canberra time.",
