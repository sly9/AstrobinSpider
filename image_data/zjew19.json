    "description": "I have been wanting to photograph this object for such a long time. I finally captured enough data to really show the stunning beauty this monster of a target is. All of that faint wispy HA makes me smile. Reduced to 390mm at f4.8 I think the QHY294M-Pro and ED80 did a good job with this one. A few more nights was all I needed to finish capturing data on this stunning deep sky object. I finished with some SII and started crunching away at the process. I'm pretty happy with the results. I'd love to add some RGB stars to it.. so maybe thats next on my list! We will see!",
