    "description": "The constellation Orion has so much to offer, but around my location it often remains covered by fog and clouds during winter season. So i decided to utilize even hazy conditions with bad seeing for this motif, which has been waiting on my favourite list for so long. I only got 7 to 9 long exposures per color, and couldnt accomplish any narrowband data for luminance. Maybe i can make up leeway some time this winter.\r\n\r\nThe Running Man nebula - for me it's the Airwalk Nebula because of its resemblance to a certain brand logo - is located directly next to the much brighter Great Orion Nebula and therefore frequently overlooked. It is a bright reflection nebula with also some emission, located inside the Orion molecular cloud, about 1500 LJ distant, and contains many young stars forming open cluster NGC 1981",
