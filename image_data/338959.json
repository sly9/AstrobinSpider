    "description": "This is the first time I have ever photographed this sizeable Centuarian feast, and I'm quite surprised at its brightness and interesting features. In particular, the Bok Globules ... relatively small dark nebulae containing molecular hydrogen (H2), carbon oxides, helium, and silicate dust. \r\n\r\nI thought these were from dust/dirt on my sensor, and almost Clone Stamped them out!\r\n\r\nThanks for looking at my Chicken!",
