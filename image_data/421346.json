    "description": "We spent 2 days camped at this incredible place called Morro do Cuscuzeiro, located in Anal√¢ndia, in the interior of Sao Paulo. A very dark place, perfect for astrophotography, which together with the natural beauty of the Cuscuzeiro and the surroundings, make the evening an excellent experience. I hope every person at least one day of his life can spend a night like this.",
