    "description": "This is a cropped part of the previous image, with additional data acquired with the QSI690 camera (hence the smaller FOV). It was an interesting experiment in combining data from two different cameras and working on the colour palette of Ha(S2O3)O3 in order to show the delicate details of the nebulosity.  Any comments are welcome!",
