    "description": "Here was my project just before the holidays. NGC 6951 is face-on Seyfert Type II galaxy in the constellation Cepheus. At a distance of about 75 million light-years, the galaxy is viewed through the Integrated Flux Nebula (IFN). The residual light of our galaxy illuminates the faint surrounding molecular clouds. The galaxy is also cataloged as NGC 6952. I kept nearly 20Hours of total integration time to compose this image.",
