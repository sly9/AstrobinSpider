    "description": "Took this after a visit to the summit of Mauna Kea. \r\nThis was quickly snapped from the Visitor's Centre at an altitude of around 2800m with only a few minutes to assemble tripod, camera and lens and point at the right part of the sky before our tour departed back down to Hilo. The red in the  tree branches is from the red torches of the local astronomers who run the sky tours.\r\nThe northern Milky Way is almost unknown to southern hemisphere dwellers like myself. You can see Andromeda at centre left and Capella is the bright star at the top centre right.  \r\n\r\n",
