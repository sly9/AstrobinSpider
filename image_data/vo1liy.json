    "description": "My first complete experience with remote telescope access.  I managed to image Eta Carinae in 2010 from the Winter Star Party (on my website).  I really love this object and even at the very low altitude from the Florida Keys, I was hooked.  I captured my remote telescope experience in video at my channel below.  \r\nhttps://youtu.be/pLZKJXA3pc8\r\nIt was a blast collecting and processing this data.  The data is so good from this location.  If you have thought about remote imaging but want a little more insight, please check out my video or drop me a line.  \r\nClear skies.",
