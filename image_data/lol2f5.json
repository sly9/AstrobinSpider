    "description": "Venus is bigger and bigger :) Now it's size is around 21,5'' and it's close ot size of Mars during this year opposition in October (so it's good chance to test equipment in terms of final picture scale :) )\r\n\r\nAtmosphere was quite stable during this session - so UV detail of Venusian clouds was nicely revelaed. \r\nWhat I observed is that best seeing is few minutes after sunset.",
