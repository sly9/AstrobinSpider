    "description": "Apart from a few cloudy periods, the sky became clear so that I could make my shots in anticipation of this animation. \r\n\r\nI set a fixed exposure during all the time of the advance of the shadow of the Earth, to keep a certain homogeneity. The settings were changed at the time of total eclipse to capture the red moon.\r\n\r\nNo software wanted to align the images, I had to align them one by one.\r\n\r\nFocal lenght : 600mm - ISO 100 - F/6.3 - 1/1600s - Trigger every 30s",
