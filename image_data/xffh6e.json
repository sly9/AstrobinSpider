    "description": "This is a 50 pane mosaic I imaged whilst on holiday in New Zealand. I travelled to the very dark skies   near the base of the Mt Hutt Ski Field (SQM21.98).\r\n\r\nI used a ball-head with panoramic slider on top of a Star Adventurer EQ mount and moved the camera manually, guessing the overlap required by looking at the location of the brighest stars in the camera's LCD.\r\n\r\nI didn't take any calibration frames at the time as I was rushed, and found out when processing that they would be necessary due to vignetting-related banding issues in the final mosaic.  So I placed the camera and lens in my fridge which would approximate the 5 degree Celsius shooting conditions, and then took a full set of calibration frames.\r\n\r\nAll resultant  images were then fed into AstroPixelProcessor which produced the mosaic with ease, and used its light pollution removal tool to minimise any residual inter-frame banding.",
