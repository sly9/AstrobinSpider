    "description": "Had two nights in a row of fabulous seeing early last week, and put in two all nighters snapping pics. We had a lot of snow still on the ground, so I used an IDAS light pollution filter to combat all the extra reflected street light being scattered into the sky.\r\n\r\nI've been meaning to get the Eskimo nebula for a while, but have had bad luck trying to get images under a great sky. This nebula is pretty fascinating and so bright that you can get a lot of detail without long exposures.\r\n\r\nThe first night I only got 100 seconds of live stacking in SharpCap before clouds rolled in for 2 hours. Then the nebula was behind my house, and I though that would be it. Then, the second night turned out great too and I got a chance to take three more 131s live stacks of 1 second frames to get 393s of data to add to the previous night 100s of data for a grand total of 393s. Confusing, yeah.",
