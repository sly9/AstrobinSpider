    "description": "This is a 2 panel mosaic of the Iris Nebula (NGC 7023) Region in Cepheus.  I started on the Iris nebula left side of the image last year.  Some more data was taken for that panel and also the 2nd panel was added this year.  There are several reflection and dark nebula within the image with the most prominent being the arrow shape on the right, dark nebula LBN 468.  The spiral galaxy at the bottom of the frame, NGC 6951, is about 75 million light years away.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanon 6D modified\r\nISO 1600\r\n65 x 360 sec x 2 panels\r\nSV80ST at 480 mm f/6\r\nCEM60",
