    "description": "This project started in 2017 in small, silent Balatonbereny in Hungary during my vacations. Enjoying excellent Hungarian wine during beautiful dark nights I have taken about 60% of panels of this image. Than I've noticed how dusty is all the sky around the Milky Way (for sure not so clean as I saw it on most of the pictures). The next year I've collected next panels in the same place and in different locations in Poland trying in meanwhile to build something of it. \r\n\r\nThe project was waken up and suspended several times as it was really hard to combine something good having so many panels taken in different conditions, different amount of time etc. Finaly I have found the way how to process it and honestly it wouldn't be possible without AstroPixelProcessor - a wonderful tool for such mosaics (however either Pix and PS did the huge work here either). The overall image is a crop of 61 panels mosaic made with Samyang 135/2 and mostly unmoded Nikon D610 - i.a. something about 1000 frames - 60s when tracked on SWSA and 120s when tracked with HEQ5. The result image has been combined with most of my other pictures, covering this area, taken with moded D610 to increase of Hydrogen signal. \r\n\r\nI know some panels could be taken again to make this image better, however combining images from moded and unmoded camera is a nightmare. I hope you'll enjoy the picture.",
