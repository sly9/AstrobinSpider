    "description": "Sh2-313 (Abell 35) is a peculiar planetary nebula (?) due to the very unique bow shock wave near its core suggesting the nebula is plowing through the interstellar medium. It has a low surface brightness requiring long exposures in Ha and OIII to reveal more details. The bow shock only visible in OIII.\r\nLocated in Hydra, it has a diameter of around 11 arc minutes at a distance close to 1200 light years having then an aproximate size of 5 light years.\r\nAll data was captured from a Bortle 7 zone and consist of 40 hours in Ha and 21 hours in OIII, but I consider that, for my location, more capture total time is required both, on Ha and on OIII and could be a good idea to also to check what can one get with the SII filter.\r\nEquipment: 4\" SVq100 refractor, f/5.8 and camera QSI 660 mono camera with a 5 nm Ha Astrodon filter and a 3 nm OIII Astrodon filter. Did not get SII data.\r\nProcesed in Pixinsight and captured with SGP, all from my backyard at Lat -33, Long -70, Santiago, Chile.",
