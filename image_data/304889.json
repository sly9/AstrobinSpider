    "description": "This image is both: A result and an outlook. It sums up what I could acquire this season at 135mm FL and it clearly shows which gaps to fill to get some nice mosaics next season(s).\r\n\r\nThis is going to be my last image for this summer.  I am going to leave my home soon to start a sailing trip at the Atlantic coasts of north America for the next months. I hope to have a great time there, but I will miss AP, AB and this community. I am looking forward to see many, many great pictures in autumn.",
