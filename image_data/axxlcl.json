    "description": "UK weather has been cooperating lately and I had a few good nights in a row. Started working on this project and intended for a full SHO palette but third night didn't turn out so still need to gather the Sii data. Forecast turned cloudy so I decided to try HOO with this one and loved how it turned out. Blend was as follows:\r\n\r\nR=Ha\r\nG=0.6*Ha + 0.4*Oiii\r\nB=Oiii",
