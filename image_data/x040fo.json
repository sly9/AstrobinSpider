    "description": "NGC1499 - The California nebula lies in the constellation of Perseus at a declination of 36Â° 25' and 1000 - 1500 light years from Earth.  It lies in the Orion arm of the milky way.  The nebula is much larger than I can capture in a single frame with my FOV.\r\n\r\nA slight mishap with the rotation of my camera caused me to have to crop this a bit, but I'm still quite happy with the framing on the final image. With the strong signal in all three channels, I decided to leave a bit more of the green channel in to accent the different regions.  The lovely colors and structure have me thinking of doing a mosaic to capture the entire region...",
