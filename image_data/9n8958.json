    "description": "Another target from my trip to Arkhyz. IC342 or The Hidden Galaxy. \r\n\r\nIts called \"Hidden\" because despite its size and brightness it is located in dusty clouds near the galactic equator and that makes it difficult to observe. It is so bright that if it was located in different area (less dusty) it would be possible to see it by naked eye!\r\n\r\nBut dark skies of Arkhyz and patience in getting enough of exposure time allows us to \"unhide\" it at least to some extent :)\r\n\r\nHad difficulties processing it, tried to show variety of colors, but the dust seems to be making different colors less different. \r\n\r\nSo let me know what you think? As always guys I appreciate your feedback! Thanks\r\n\r\nPS. I marked \"closeup image\" as main one. But you can also see full field following this link - https://www.astrobin.com/9n8958/B",
