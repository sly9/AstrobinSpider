    "description": "After what feels like a long time, the skies cleared to some imaging.\r\n\r\nTolga gave me a offered me a chance to beta test QHY814 CCD camera and I figured it is a good time to switch to some widefield imaging and loaded it on my Takahashi FSQ106. I am working on writing a review of the camera and it should be up in the coming days. The short answer is, it is as good as I was expecting (comparing it with the QSI690 which has the same chip).\r\nI figured, a nice bright target is in order for testing the camera and with the new moon cycle, the IC434 region in Orion with its emission, reflection nebula and bright star Alnitak is a good target to test. This is actually a tougher target at my location because I have to shoot into Austin light bubble and it gets behind the trees in 3 hours each night and I never had a good result on this target on my earlier attempt.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion D: Calling it done at this point. NR, greencast removal .. .",
