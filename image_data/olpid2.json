    "description": "This is a blended image consisting of data I took of M45 from my Bortle 8/9 skies awhile back, and images I took on 4/4 of Venus mingling with the Seven Sisters. I used a homemade mask to stop down the ED80 to make Venus look better than a blown out misshapen blob, it gave me nice diffraction spikes too!\r\n\r\nM45 Details:\r\nCaptured 01/01/2020, 231x60s, 3.9 hours\r\nScope: William Optics GT81 with FLAT6AIII .8x Flattener/Reducer\r\nCamera: ZWO ASI294MC Pro\r\nMount: Rainbow Astro RST135\r\nFilter: Optolong L-eNhance LP filter\r\n\r\nVenus/M45 Details:\r\nCaptured 04/04/2020, 20x10s\r\nScope: Skywatcher Esprit 80ED Pro with Starizona APEX-S .65x reducer\r\nCamera: ZWO ASI533MC Pro\r\nMount: Rainbow Astro RST135\r\nFilter: Optolong L-Pro \r\n\r\nPre and post processing in Pixinsight.
