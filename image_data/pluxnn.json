    "description": "Moon 1 day and 8 hours before the third quarter, September 9, 2020. All the majesty of the icon of the lunar surface structures - Ptolemaeus, Alphonsus and Arzachel (PAA). Faint shadows accentuate the relief of the craters. In Alphonsus Crater, a \"web\" of clefts with several dark halo craters (DHC) is an artifact of ancient lunar volcanism. The young Arzachel crater, the depth of the expressiveness of the terraced slopes and the impressive central hill, shows that it is the youngest of the three; above it a small Alpetragius with a dome in the center, on the left \"budding\" Thebit, further Rupes Recta (Straight Wall) and Rima Birt, on the right two large craters - Albategnius and Hipparchus. Two chains of craters - Catena Davy and Catena Abulfeda - are perfectly visible near Ptolemy.",
