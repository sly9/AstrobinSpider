    "description": "Imaged on nights of  2018-11-5, 2018-11-9, 2018-11-12, 2018-11-13.\r\nThe RGB were taken on the AG12+ASI1600MM at .70 asec/pix, the L on TV127is+ASI183MM at .75 asec/pix. Using L from the TV NP127is refractor effectively eliminates the spikes from the AG12.\r\n\r\nThis target contains the most amazing collection of different colors.  The two listed NGC nebulas are only a very small part of the whole image.\r\n\r\nNGC 2170 is a reflection nebula in the constellation Monoceros. It was discovered on October 16, 1784 by William Herschel.\r\n(Wikipedia)",
