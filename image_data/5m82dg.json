    "description": "EGB 4 (a nebula discovered by Ellis, Grayson, & Bond in 1984) is NOT a comet, despite it's comet-like appearance. It is an emission nebula surrounding a catacylismic binary star system called BZ Cam in the constellation of Camelopardis.\r\n\r\nIt has an unusual bow-shock structure as BZ Cam (with it's associated wind) moves through the interstellar medium, similar to the bow wave in front of a ship that is moving through water. \r\n\r\nBZ Cam is believed to be a white dwarf star that is accreting  mass from an accompanying main-sequence star of 0.3-0.4 solar masses.\r\nIt is around 2,500 light years away, and has a space velocity of 125 km/second.\r\n\r\nI can only find one previous image of EGB 4 online, a NASA APOD from 2000, so I believe this could be the first amateur image and the first colour image.\r\n\r\nYes it's ridiculously faint!\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\napod.nasa.gov/apod/ap001128.html\r\n\r\nTHE ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL, 115:286-295, 1998 January Â© 1998.
