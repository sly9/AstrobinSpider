    "description": "199 30\" images stacked/ layered in GIMP, ISO 400.\r\nThis is the first star-trail image that I have done (that's actually turned out), and it was interesting to see the star trails grow longer as more layers were added.\r\n\r\nThe tree came out quite bright due to passing cars and flashlights, but I was surprised to see so many colors in the stars:)\r\n\r\nI also got images of NEOWISE from the same night, it looked amazing! I'm still working on the images, but seeing the comet through the telescope was incredible.",
