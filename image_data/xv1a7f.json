    "description": "I did not resist the urge to image the planet despite its small diameter, and also to resume \"training\" before the opposition in October.\r\n\r\nNow that the height is above 40 degrees you had to see..\r\n\r\nYou will notice the orientation with the south at the top (well, that's my preference..). Thus, are visible Hellas Planitia under the polar cap, and opposite Arabia Terra even clearer, framed by Syrtis Mayor at the bottom left and Meridani Planum on the right.\r\n\r\nAs my friend Niall MacNeill indicated, the polar cap has a huge cleft that corresponds to the partial melting of the ice in this season.\r\n\r\nTechnically, this is an LRGB image made from 5 1-mn videos per RGB channel (from 03:08 UT to 03:31 UT or 23 mm of derotation). I selected 6,000 images out of a total of 75,000 and added an IR image as a luminance for final processing with WinJupos.",
