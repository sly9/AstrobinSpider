    "description": "M100, 2nd test imaging session with ZWO OAG.  I was very happy with how easy it was to get working.  I needed to adjust focus twice throughout the night after installing it, but otherwise it worked like a champ out of the gate, which is quite a relief to someone who is used to working with very stubborn, difficult gear.   I'm also seeing a noticeable improvement in my stacked images - I must have had some flexing of the guide scope/mount before.  For the cost (w/camera) of a good eyepiece, it seems like a no-brainer for imaging.  Only took me two years to take the plunge!",
