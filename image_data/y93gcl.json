    "description": "I have wanted for a very long time to use a monochrome camera and capture The Eagle Nebula in SHO. And it finally happened this week at a Bortle 2 true dark site. This week has been one of the best weeks I've had in such a long time. 4 nights under clear dark skies. 5 Deep Sky targets captured. And the icing on the cake was this image. I really took my time on this one trying to stay true to the Hubble palette theme but I definitely added a bit of my own to it. I hope you love this just as much as I do! Gods universe is so beautiful! Clear skies friends!",
