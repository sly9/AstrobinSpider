    "description": "This group of galaxies in Coma Berenices includes an interacting pair, NGC4725 (near center) and NGC4747 (lower left).  At an approximate 45 Mly distance, this pair has experienced tidal interaction that produced a tail on NGC4747 and a burst of star formation in NGC4725. This interaction is also potentially responsible for the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of NGC4725 (a Seyfert galaxy) and its diffuse and dramatic single spiral arm.  The small galaxy near the top of the field is NGC4712, a background galaxy approximately 200 Mly distant. Light pollution really made getting good color on this difficult and seeing was not wonderful.\r\n\r\nWeb sites:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.stellarsolace.com/\">StellarSolace</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StellarSolace-1588021434610921/\">Facebook page</a>",
