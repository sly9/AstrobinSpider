    "description": "I really wanted to update my M16 image series with the ASI1600, but I do not think that I will put this camera back on this cope for some time, the 6200 is working wonderfully, and with this FOV it is hard to resist using it. But it was a great target to compare the 2 cameras, right now I do have roughly the same amount of integration time in this and the previous M16 image. \r\nSo I star aligned both in version C and have them side by side. Processing played a significant role of course, and no matter how close you want to make the images, there always will be the slight differences. Most \"changing\" process is the \"translation\" of the original SHO image into the \"gold/blue\" color pattern. Slight changes to reduce the green (with the green mask) have a tremendous impact on the final outcome. I played so many times around this by now, and sometimes the results were nice, sometimes pretty bad. And I have not found a \"standard\" to do this, it is from image to image different. \r\nSo here my final result of the almost full frame of the Eagle Nebula, at 925mm FL this is just wonderful. Full frame sensors are nice!",
