    "description": "Jones-Emberson 1 is a planetary nebula in the constellation Lynx'\r\nIt was discovered in 1939 and is also catalogued as PK 164+31.1\r\nThe distance to earth is 1600 lightyears and the diameter is about 4 lightyears. \r\nThe star of which the nebula was born is right in the centre, now being a blue colored white dwarf star. \r\n\r\nThis nebula registers well in narrowband. Each of my subs shows the nebula quite well. However, it does take a lot of time to register a version that is less noisy and shows detail, of which this nebula has plenty!\r\nI used a total of 25 hours of exposure for the narrowband part and 30 minutes UV/IR filter image for the stars (with short sub exposure times to control star sizes).",
