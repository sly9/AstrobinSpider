    "description": "Addendum:\r\nThis image (B) of the California Nebula shows a bit more detail than my previous version.  I have been using the autosave file that DSS creates and bringing that into Photoshop for processing as I thought the autosave file was not stretched.  However, after getting advice from Astrobin users Victor Van Puyenbroeck and Trevor Jones (also with Astrobackyard.com), I saved the image with the DSS settings embedded but not applied.  I then turned up the exposure in order to view the image and then did my normal stretching with curves and such.\r\n\r\nSo does this mean I am going to reprocess every image I have done?  Perhaps when I retire...\r\n\r\nOriginal Post:\r\nThis is the California Nebula (NGC 1499) and is my Second attempt with HaRGB processing. \r\nI believe the Ha image shows more detail than the Pacman Nebula Ha image although it does not show as much detail is Trevor Jones (Astrobackyard.com) Ha-California version. He seems to have mastered Ha processing.  Once again this was taken when the moon was out which I find really cool.  I decided take 2 minute exposures using the Ha filter but only managed collect about 1-hour of data.  The color will have to wait as the cold winter weather is taking a turn for the worse.",
