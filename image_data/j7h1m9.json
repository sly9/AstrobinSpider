    "description": "With the Dark Sky week coming to an end and the milky-way core with all the wonderful summer targets starting to show their beauty above the northern hemisphere horizon, I would like to share with you what can be achieved in a short time, under truly dark skies with only a modest dslr and a fast lens.\r\nThis is a photo shot 2 years ago on a trip to the bortle 2 skies of the wonderful Wales. That was the first and only time I have seen the clouds being lit up by the stars above and not by the light pollution, an absolutely incredible experience that I will never forget. \r\nI only wish those amazing skies would be closer and available to all of us that love the stars. \r\nThe photo was taken with a modified canon 700d and a Samyang 135mm f2 lens on a eq3 mount. Total integration time is only one hour, made up of 21x3min exposures. \r\nI hope you enjoy this magnificent target that is close to impossible to a lot of the UK fellow astrophotographers.",
