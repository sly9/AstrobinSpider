    "description": "Tycho is an impact crater located in the southern lunar mountains, named after the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. It is a relatively young crater: it dates back 107 million years according to estimates made on samples of rock ejected from the crater brought back by the Apollo 17 mission. This age suggests that it may have been created by the family of asteroids that would also be responsible for the extinction of dinosaurs on Earth.          \r\nThe crater has well-defined contours unlike older craters which are modified by later impacts.\r\nThe crater has a diameter of 82 km and its edges rise to 4.7 km above the level of the floor (interior). In the center of the crater is a peak that rises 2 km above the floor.\r\n(Wikipedia)  \r\n\r\nThe proximity of the terminator and the enlargement of the view do not make it possible to assess the existence of rays from its centre and located outside which extend for 1,500 km and which are made up of material ejected at the time of impact.\r\n\r\nThe versions presented show two images, one (B) to compare Tycho to the C11 with the view of the Lunar Reconnaissance Oberver (LRO), the other (C) of the LRO showing its central peak with a surprising rock placed at the top.",
