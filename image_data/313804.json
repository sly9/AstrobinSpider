    "description": "I decided tonight that I would like to try and image IC 59 and IC 63 again but this time\r\nuse a larger aperture scope.    I had problems with polar alignment tonight along with\r\nproblems with clouds and heavy moisture in the air.   Because of the problems I did not\r\ntake as many light frames as I intended and because of the clouds and moisture a lot\r\nof my light frames were not usable  and some of the frames I categorized as usable were\r\nreally questionable.  But with all of that said I did manage to get an image and I'm pleased \r\nwith it for now.   I think without all the problems I could get a better image next time.   I really\r\nlike these objects for some reason and I'd never seen or heard of these objects until I imaged\r\nthem the other night.   Obscure Deep Sky objects like this are appealing to me.  So I probably\r\nwill keep imaging IC 59 and IC 63  trying different things until I finally get \"the image\".\r\nIt appears that these objects are not imaged a lot and that surprises me.   The bright star\r\n(yCas)  in the center of the image  made processing very difficult.   I only thought the star was\r\nbright when I used my 72mm refractor.   Kicking the aperture up to 200mm also kicked up\r\nthe brightness of the star. ",
