    "description": "NGC 3109 is classified as a small barred Magellanic type spiral or irregular galaxy 4.3 million light years from Earth. NGC 3109 has a mass of about 2.3×10 ^9 times the mass of our Sun, of which 20% is in the form of neutral hydrogen.\n\nNGC 3109 has a mass of about 2.3×109 times the mass of the Sun, of which 20% is in the form of neutral hydrogen. It is oriented edge-on from our point of view, and may contain a disk and a halo. The disk appears to be composed of stars of all ages, whereas the halo contains only very old and metal-poor stars. NGC 3109 does not appear to possess a galactic nucleus.\n\nFrom measurements of the neutral atomic hydrogen in the galaxy, it has been found that the disk of NGC 3109 is warped. The warp has the same radial velocity as gas in the Antlia Dwarf galaxy, indicating that the two galaxies had a close encounter approximately one billion years ago\n\nRA: 10h 03m 07.5s\nDEC: -26° 09’ 43\"\nSize: 40.1 x 27 arcmin\nOrientation: Up is 134 degrees E of N\nLocation: Hydra\nDistance: 4.3 Mly\nMagnitude: 10.4\n\nAcquisition January 2021\nTotal acquisition time of 29.3 hours.\n\nTechnical Details\nData acquisition: <a href=\"https://www.martinpughastrophotography.space/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Martin PUGH</a>\nProcessing: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nicolasrollandastro/\">Nicolas ROLLAND</a>\nLocation: El Sauce Observatory, Rio Hurtado, Chile\nLocation: \nL 22 x 1200 sec\nR 15 x 1200 sec\nG 15 x 1200 sec\nB 15 x 1200 sec\nHa 14 x 1800 sec\nOptics: Planewave 17“ CDK @ F6.8\nMount: Paramount ME\nCCD: SBIG STXL-11002 (AOX)\nPre Processing: CCDstack & Pixinsight\nPost Processing: Photoshop CC",
