    "description": "Imagine a shock wave racing through interstellar space.  This is what you are looking at. \r\n Herschel’s Ray is a sheet of glowing gas that we see almost edge-on from our vantage point.  The structure contains many bright intertwined braided filaments giving a three-dimensional look.  You can find this beautiful object near the Vela Pulsar in the constellation Vela.  At an estimated distance of 800 light years away, and about 5 light years in length, its size is within the grasp of most amateur astrophotographers.  The shockwave is moving through interstellar space at over 500,000 kilometres per hour.  After the initial explosion, it was travelling in the millions of kilometres per hour range.  I guess we all slow down in time.  \r\n\r\nTraditional broadband imaging of this area reveals some lovely dark voids, a range of colourful stars, and a lovely teal colour not present in many celestial objects.  Narrowband filters reveal strong emissions that may not be seen clearly with RGB imaging.  My intent was to merge the interesting features from both imaging domains into one, and attempting to retain a colour space similar to that found in traditional RGB imaging.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the final result, I was pleased with the intermixing of reds and blues at the bottom left of the image.  It looks to be glowing and appears to have a three dimensional quality like the main target of the image.  The data was pushed fairly hard in an attempt to reveal the background dark voids against a curtain of stellar dust.  Hopefully, I didn't introduce to much noise.  Herschel’s Ray is an incredible structure racing across the cosmos.\r\n\r\nInstruments Used:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\nBaader Planetarium OIII Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\nOIII 87X1800      \r\nHa 58X1800        \r\nLum 52X900        \r\nRed 16X450        \r\nGreen 16X450      \r\nBlue 16X450       \r\n\r\nThanks for looking",
