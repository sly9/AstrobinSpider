    "description": "On December 10th I started a 4 panel mosaic that would include IC405, IC410, and IC417.  The first panel is IC417.  This panel just completed all of its frames 2 days ago (#clouds_suck) and I wanted to give it a quick process to see how things were looking.  I was pleased enough with the quick processing to go back and do a better job of it.  I thought I would share it as there is no telling how long it will take for the other 3 panels to be completed.  Plus, I thought that this was strong enough to stand on its own.\r\n\r\nC and C always welcome.\r\nTim.",
