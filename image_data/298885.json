    "description": "I piggybacked my DSLR onto the back of my Borg 76ED attached to a Celestron AVX mount and threw on my 50-200mm lens.  The lens was set at 100mm, f/5.6.  I took a whole stack, but stacking in DeepSkyStacker didn't turn out very nicely (I don't think it's meant for this kind of image), so I just processed a single frame through so I could do dark subtraction and bias correction, and then did some touching up in Photoshop, since it came out very noisy from DSS that way.  Oh well, I kind of like this result!",
