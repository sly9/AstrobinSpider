    "description": "The Dark Wolf Nebula is situated in the Southern constellation of Lupus. It is located at around 500 ly from Earth. It's a target that is rarely imaged, I found under 10 images on the Web. \r\n\r\nThis is my first dark nebula. I started this project with Chilescope almost two months ago, but due to bad weather it advanced really slowly. It was the first time when I used bin 2 for the RGB in order to increase the exposure time for the Luminance and pull out as much faint detail as possible. Binning x 2 does create some artifacts (I simply staraligned in Pixinsight, maybe a Drizzle would have been a better solution). This is the first processing, I wasn't able to significantly improve it with the next essays (something that happens pretty often, you have to get it right the first time). Hope you like it.",
