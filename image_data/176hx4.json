    "description": "I'm starting to get the hang or Deconvolution, or at least it seems to help tease out the details in this interesting object. However, it didn't help me see the chicken that is its namesake. I found the Bok globules of very dark nebulosity fascinating and tried to keep some green in the image to show off the nooks and crannys of the gas cloud. The Hubble pallette was used with RGB stars added back after processing.",
