    "description": "M104 is a challenging target from my location.   It skims by trees for just a couple hours every night and I only have a couple months to capture it before it is obscured.   \r\n\r\nI spent many nights on this image in both capture and processing.   Generally, I'm happy that I was able to produce an image, but the quality of the data was not as good as I'm used to.   It was a difficult acquisition and process for me.   I wish I had collected more luminance data.  But, this one is done for this year, anyway.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
