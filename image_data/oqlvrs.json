    "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is my first spring milky way panorama of the season, taken from a small path in the middle of the wineyards.\r\nThe sky was clear, with no cloud, but with very bad transparency. As you can see, the light pollution is visible until 20Â°.\r\nTherefore I struggled with the color balance, which is not perfectly adjusted.\r\nAnyway I'm quite satisfied with this first ML.\r\n\r\nThe panorama consists of 28 images, each is 5x6 sec at 6400 ISO, with Samyang 35mm at f2.2.\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\n\r\nDavid",
