    "description": "This was my first shot of an object that had been inaccessible from our observatory before we took down some trees blocking the southern horizon. Now there's a whole new set of targets on the menu! The Antennae Galaxies don't rise above 30Ëš here, so I still have to deal with dispersion and light pollution in that direction, but at least I got lucky with semi-decent seeing. It only took two imaging sessions and a Photoshop war dance for this keeper.",
