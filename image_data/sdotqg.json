    "description": "North is up in this image.  This image shows a region of interstellar material, Hydrogen, and dust illuminated by nearby stars. The central part of this image is NGC 1555 commonly known as Hind's Variable Nebula. The nearby illuminating / energizing star is T Tauri. This star is the prototype of a T Tau variable star - characterized by the surrounding variable nebula with its outbursts.  NGC 1555 is also known as SH2-238, Cederblad 32b and closely nearby vdB 28. In a broader but uncertain region around NGC 1555 is Struve's Lost Nebula (NGC 1554). It is believed to have been a brief outburst nebula at the time of Struve's observation and its location may be somewhat uncertain. Within this area is also LBN 817, Cederblad 32a, 32c , dark nebulae and a molecular cloud. These objects and some of the brighter stars are identified in the <a href=\"http://www.jthommes.com/Astro/images/NGC1555_MN152_PS3_PI3_Crp_annotated.jpg\">annotated image</a>. Horizontal FOV is approximately 88 arc minutes. Full size image scale is 1.57 arcsec/pix.",
