    "description": "Per Aspera Ad Astra\r\n\r\nThrough Hardship To The Stars\r\n\r\n\"-AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT: SOL 119\r\nYou know what!? Fuck this! Fuck this airlock, fuck that Hab, and fuck this whole planet! Seriously, this is it! I've had it! I've got a few minutes before I run out of air and I'll be damned if I spend them playing Mars's little game. I'm so god damned sick of it I could puke! All I have to do is sit here. The air will leak out and I'll die. I'll be done. No more getting my hopes up, no more self-delusion, and no more problem-solving. I've fucking had it!\r\n-AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT: SOL 119 (2)\r\nSigh...okay. I've had my tantrum and now I have to figure out how to stay alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mark Watney\"\r\nAndy Weir, The Martian\r\n\r\nThis is a mosaic picture of Cygnus constellation. The image is a composite of 6 panels (3x2) mosaic in hubble palette, each panel has 6 hours (2hours per channel), roughly 430×5 minutes sub exposures.\r\n\r\nFor me this picture is the ultimate thing of what I am capable to do at the moment. Just imagine I have camped for 11 nights, alone, set up my whole rig at dusk and took it apart at dawn. 4 wasted nights (due to clouds), many hours lost to correct the tilt on my shitty ZWO lens adapter, had to use a piece of paper as a step down ring because I had no canon body to adjust the aperture. Power problems, mount problems and countless reasons to pack it up and go home. So many problems in post processing, including bad star shape, never-aligning channels, difference background illumination and so on, it took me 65 hours to complete the picture.\r\nWith a cheap ass lens and cheaper lens adapter, i couldn't come up with a better one.\r\nWell I can now say that I am not a quitter\r\n\r\nZWO 1600MM-C\r\nCanon 200mm L II f2.8\r\nBaader filters\r\nSHO: (24,24,24)×5 min for each cahnnel\r\nTotal exposure: 36 hours\r\nNEQ6-Pro",
