    "description": "NGC 5128 or Centaurus A is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth at a distance of approximately 12 million light-years. It has a distinctive central dust lane and an active galactic nucleus containing a supermassive black hole creating a relativistic jet which emits in visual, radio and X-ray wavelengths. The inner and outer filaments of the optical jet are visible here as the red streaks between 2 and 3 o'clock. It is an unusual galaxy, possibly the result of a merger between an elliptical galaxy and a smaller spiral galaxy.\r\n\r\nData by Martin Pugh, Heaven's Mirror Observatory, New South Wales, Australia.",
