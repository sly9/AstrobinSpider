    "description": "I have always loved this region in wide field and this has a lot going on with its field of red Ha and reflection region with bright blue stars as well as a rich field of golden stars. The dark nebulae strands are outstanding..I do wish I had a slightly bigger FOV . Adam Block's fantastic APOD version is my benchmark!\r\n\r\nThis is shot from equipment shared by me and Dhaval Bhrambhatt in Marthon with its excellent skies. With  light pollution increasing, There is no way I could shoot this from Austin any more. \r\n\r\nThis target is quite low and I had to eke out data each night before it goes below the observator ywalls.",
