    "description": "Hi everyone!!!\r\n\r\nI reprocessed from scratch the image because I’ve notice that some fine details were lost in some step of the process.\r\n\r\nToday I wanted to share with you the First Light of my new Newtonian Telescope, a SW 250 pds (254/1200) F4.7, which turned to be 254/1086 when used with the SW 0.9 Coma corrector, so the setup is a F4.28!!!.\r\nAlso, this was an excellent experiment for me, because thanks to Optolong, which gave me a L-Pro filter as a prize of an astrophotography contest, I could test how good can be a LRGB image from skies bortle 9 with employing an anti-pollution filter.\r\nSo I stacked the LRGB filters with the L-Pro (wich was screwed on the CC) and the result really amazed me.\r\n\r\nI Hope you enjoy it, clear skies!!\r\n\r\nPs1: I leave you here the technical data since here in astrobin I can not describe the stack of filters:\r\n*Gain 100, -25 º C, R-CCD 2\" Svbony + L-Pro 2\" Optolong, 50x120\"\r\n*Gain 100, -25 º C, G-CCD 2\" Svbony + L-Pro 2\" Optolong, 50x120\"\r\n*Gain 100, -25 º C, B-CCD 2\" Svbony + L-Pro 2\" Optolong, 50x120\"\r\n*Gain 100, -25 º C, L 2\" Optolong + L-Pro 2\" Optolong, 197x120\"\r\n\r\nPS2: I want to dedicate this image to Diego Gravinese and Juan Filas, two great persons that I have the pleasure to interact with, learn from them, and enjoy with them. Thanks Diego and Juan!!",
