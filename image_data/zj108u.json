    "description": "My first attempt on the chaotic NGC1333 was back in 2017. The unique structure and the colorful region draw me like a powerful magnet. Bound by the limited weather condition I challenged it, nonetheless. I failed. After 3 years, with a fixed station I decided to challenge it again. I wonâ€™t claim a victory, yet the result is acceptable. The newborn star combines with the HH object in the dusty core of the nebula yield a delicate piece of jewel with well crafted sapphire, rubies and opal. I simply name it the celestial pendant, since the rather scientific name of NGC1333 shadows its beauty.  The image is captured with LRGB method with RGB at bin 2.",
