    "description": "My attempts at processing the whole nebula in HOO were a failure, but I think this area doesn't look that bad.\r\nSkies are clear tonight and hopefully for a few days in a row, so here we go again. At least it makes the quarantine a lot more bearable. \r\nStay home, image the Cosmos.\r\n\r\nDiego",
