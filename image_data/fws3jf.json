    "description": "Here is VdB152 and surrounding dust structures in Cepheus, caught with the RASA 8 last night. The nebulosity in this area is quite faint, and this is what 5.5 hours at f/2 could collect. \r\n\r\nThe bird-gead like structure to the right is VdB 152 (also known as Cederblad 201), a blue reflection nebula that glows atop of a dark Bok globule called Barnard 175. It is located about 1,400 light years-away from Earth.",
