    "description": "A first data set on this interesting trio of objects. The Squid is quite faint and unfortunately cloud patterns prevented travel to a darker site; for 4.5 hrs of Oiii from Bortle 4 I was reasonably pleased with the result however. Ha was plenty bright at 15min exposures, Oiii definitely benefited from the the longer 30min exposures though.\r\n16 x 900s Ha, 4 x 900s Oiii + 7 x 1800s Oiii\r\nWO Redcat 51, ASI6200MM, Chroma 3nm, A-P Mach2GTO",
