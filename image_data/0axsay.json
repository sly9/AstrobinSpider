    "description": "This was actually fourth on my list of targets to process, but my data looked so good (and I knew I didn't have to do any complicated processes like tone mapping) so I thought I'd give it a try and just see what I had. I think this might be the prettiest star field I've ever imaged. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I want to dedicate this one to my grandmother, Rose (aka. \"Gagam\"), who - along with my daughter - was ultimately responsible for getting me into astrophotography. She was the one who gave us the book \"Goodnight Moon\" when my daughter was born, and that book is what sparked her interest in the moon and led us to getting our first telescope. Thanks, Gagam!",
