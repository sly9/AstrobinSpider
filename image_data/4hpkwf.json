    "description": "The reflection nebulae Van den Bergh 14 (right) and 15 (left) are located in the constellation of Camelopardalis or the Giraffe, shimmering in the light of their hot blue star companions C Cam and B Cam. Vdb 15 has a pinkish hue due to the addition of red ionised hydrogen alpha gas. The deep red structures are also hydrogen alpha emission nebulosity, a part of the large sh2-202 nebula, wich continues off the bottom edge of the image. Brownish molecular dust is prevalent on the left site, also trailing off the lefte edge of the image. Taken during bone cold -20C nights, the amount of wood I’ve burned to stay warm in the forest observatory this winter will give me a major carbon footprint this year. Tomorrow I’m getting help from a dog team led by Gunnar Solberg, a cool dude I’ve met on mornings when I’m leaving the forest and he mushing his dogs out.",
