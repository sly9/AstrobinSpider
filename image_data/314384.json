    "description": "I think I let this one get the better of me and I almost gave up halfway through it. This image was also affected by collimation problems I initially couldn't figure out. Both a spider screw and a focuser screw came loose due to the seasonal temperature changes. If it were one or the other, I think I would have solved it faster, but I spent about 4 clear nights wondering why I was collimated around Polaris, but completely off at the zenith. I ultimately finished only because I had a number of clear nights in a row (from 9/24 on, minus 2 nights) and didn't have a subject picked out that was up as soon as it got dark. I'm glad I finished it, but this one didn't come out as well as I was hoping. It's better than last year's attempt, but I think I need a higher focal length scope to really make this one work the way I want. I'm hoping to get an 8\" RC and Astrophysics 0.67x reducer some time next year. I think it'd frame this one nicely. \r\n\r\nI simplified the acquisition details a bit, because I spent too many nights capturing different datasets. I had to trash a lot, but data that made it into this was captured on 9/09, 9/11, 9/13, 9/24, 9/25, 9/26, 9/28, 9/29, 10/01 and 10/02. \r\n\r\nI have never had so many subs affected by planes - I should upload a stack of just 'plane' subs - I probably have at least 25.",
