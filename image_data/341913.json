    "description": "The area is kinda nice, but so hard to process. I can't say that I am satisfied with this image, but I couldn't get better one. Didn't want to push up IFN too much because, honestly, I think this view would be much better without it.\r\n\r\nPlease take a few seconds to look at full resolution, this area is filled with scattered small treasures:\r\n\r\n1. You can see that M81 is actually larger than it seems at a first glance - you can notice fery faint spiral arms on both sides, visible as small blue areas of star formation.\r\n\r\n2. There is a faint hydrogen cloud to the right from M82, farther than all other bright hydrogen clouds. <a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130704.html\">It's not an artefact of processing.</a>\r\n\r\n3. NGC 3077 on the very top shows some dust, plus it has few blue areas of intense star formation above it, outside all other visible glow of the galaxy itself. Not sure if they belong to the NGC 3077 though.\r\n\r\n4. Lots and lots of galaxies and thier clusters in the background! There is huge and very nice cluster of galaxies below and to the right from M82.\r\n\r\n5. Galaxy UGC 5336 (or Holmberg IX) just above M81 with its pretty large nice HII region!\r\n\r\n6. Faint galaxy LEDA 28731 to the left of M81.\r\n\r\n\r\nHydrogen is from FSQ106, LRGB is from RH305",
