    "description": "I got very good conditions last week end in the desert so I decided to catch a few photons from this fascinating object which is quite low above the horizon. I had to do everything between 40 and 30 degrees elevation. I wish I could have done more colors but unfortunately I have set my tent at the wrong place :-(\r\n\r\nOverall, I really like how it came out :-)  Nevertheless, I have a wrong distance between the focal reducer and the sensor: I'm too short  so that takes me to f7 instead of f6.3 and the coma is very annoying :-(  It is also noticeable that the coma is not symmetric (more right than left).  I did a very good collimation on the field just before shooting: I achieved a very nice Airy pattern thanks to my planetary camera (QHY5l-IIm), a 2.7x barlow and Metaguide software.  Hence, I can't explain this strong coma on the right side unless I have got a tilt in my imaging chain...",
