    "description": "This image shows some of the features that I have been able to identify and label of the Valles Marineris area. The conditions were quite poor and seeing varied between 2/5-3/5 with wind gusts of 15-25mph. Forgive any mistakes that I may have made in my labeling and I hope they are accurate and correct.\r\nThe image was acquired using my Fx2 in the f8 configuration and there are pictures and descriptions of the scope in my album for those that may be interested.",
