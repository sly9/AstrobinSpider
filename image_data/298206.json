    "description": "I have always admired the Pipe Nebula blocking the star light from the dense stars of the Milky Way.  The pipe shaped dust lane consists of the Stem (Barnard 59, 65, 66, and 67 - also known as LDN 1773) and the Bowl (Barnard 78 - also known as LDN 42).  There are several dark nebulas making up the Smoke, including the Snake Nebula Barnard 72.  Located about 600 light-years away it can be seen with the naked eye from a good dark site.  I have included an annotated image that shows the different dark nebula as well as M19 and a few other clusters.  This is my version of the Pipe Nebula:\r\n\r\nCanon T3i\r\n135mm @ f/4 ISO 1600\r\n13 x 120 sec\r\niOptron Skytracker",
