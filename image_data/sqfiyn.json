    "description": "I wanted to annotate my mosaic data (ref.6) with the M81 group members as listed in the Wikipedia article (ref. 1) and found extra information in a number of articles (ref. 2-5) that i used for a visual match with images made with large telescopes. This was not an easy task, but i could add/annotate 22 members ( of >33 in total). In image revision \"Original\" you can find a version also annotated with PGC catalog numbers.  The image needs to be viewed in full resolution (to be able to read the text and see the actual dwarf galaxies.......).\r\n\r\n\r\nref.1:\"Wikipedia: The M81 group\"\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M81_Group\r\n\r\nref. 2:\"The M 81 group of galaxies: New distances, kinematics and structure\" \r\nhttps://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2002/07/aa1940.pdf\r\n\r\nref.3:\"Dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the M81 group imaged with WFPC2\"\r\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1c03/a8a1da90a8e139743335d50b4a70408261a0.pdf\r\n\r\nref.4:\"Discovery of new dwarf galaxies in the M81 group\"\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.1250.pdf\r\n\r\nref.5:\"New Hydrogen Clouds in the M81 Group of Galaxies\"\r\n\r\nref.6:\"Volcano and Angel, Mandel-Wilson 15 panel annotated version\"\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/389783/?nc=user\r\n\r\nref.7:\"DD78 and it's Globular Cluster, members of the M81 group\"\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/gxkxed/?nc=user",
