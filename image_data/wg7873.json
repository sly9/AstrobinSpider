    "description": "Bear Claw Paw Nebula\r\n\r\nI wanted to improve my previous image as I wasn't satisfied with the overall colors and details. I figured capturing more longer exposures (1800s instead of 900s) will greatly improve the details in parts of the image. I captured 3h extra Ha and 2h of OIII and processed to enhance the details and overall color.\r\n\r\nThis nebula is one of the most active star-forming regions in the Milky Way Galaxy, spanning about 50 light-years, and contains thousands of new stars although most are hidden in the dense clouds of gas and dust. \r\n\r\nThe large glowing cloud at the bottom left earned the nickname Catâ€™s Paw because it looks like a gigantic pawprint of a cat",
