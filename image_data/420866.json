Has a size of about 30 x 20 arcminutes corresponding to a physical diameter of 16 light years.\r\nIt is estimated to be about 1794 light years from our solar system and 10,000 to 12,000 light-years away from our little blue planet.\r\nThe stars responsible for the ionization of radiant hydrogen and oxygen gas clouds are two Wolf-Rayet stars, HD 211564 (WR 152) and HD 211853 (WR 153).(Massive stars which are at an advanced stage of stellar evolution and losing mass at a very high rate)\r\nOther objects that are around this area in the image including NGC7226, Berkeley 94 and LDN 1156 & 1161.",
