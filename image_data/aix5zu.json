    "description": "Hi!! I hope you are well and safe!, Some months ago I changed my telescope from a SW 200p to a SW 250pds, and I did with it only RGB, so this is my first narrowband image with the new scope, and I think it turned very well considering that Moon was almost full in the two nights that I was imaging.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it, clear skies!!",
