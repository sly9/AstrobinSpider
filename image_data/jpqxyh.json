    "description": "The Vela Supernova Remnant is located in the southern constellation Vela at a distance of about 800 light-years.  At that distance, it's one of the closest supernova remnants to Earth.  The parent star which created this remnant , exploded approximately 11,000-12,000 years ago.  The Vela pulsar is what's left of the star which created this beautiful wispy area.\nThis image was a Pro Data Set from Telescope Live, taken with FSQ-106ED/FLI ProLine PL16083 at Heaven's Mirror Observatory, Australia.  There's LRGB subs @240s and SHO subs @450s, with a total exposure time of 5h 43m.  I processed this in Pixinght using the LRGB mostly for stars but also blending a bit of the color into the SHO version.\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\nTom",
