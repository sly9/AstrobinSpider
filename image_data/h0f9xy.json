    "description": "This is a blend of Ha and Luminance for Luminance with Ha also added to the Red Channel.  The Blue and Green channels were deconvolved a bit to try and match the star sizes with red channel.\r\n\r\nI wanted to blend the Luminance and Ha using PixelMath so that I could lean more on the Ha for the star size but equally blend the nebula.  After trying for an hour or two to create a function to compress the Luminance data after a certain point (.01 to be explicit) , I called on my recent CS grad son who gave me the function I needed.  It cut the Star peaks by over half and allowed me to sum the Ha and Luminance.  The effect was good but not earth shattering.  We may work more on this approach in future images.",
