    "description": "This famous object really do not need much introduction.\r\nThis is a HaRGB image while most of the other high resolution images of the Ring that I have seen are narrow band images, which may make this one a bit special. It contains more Ha data than most of the others from LT data that I have processed, which helped a lot to reveal the outer shells of this planetary nebula.\r\n\r\nFilters and exposures used:\r\nsdss-r  17 x 90 s\r\nHa  15 x 120 s (mixed 50:50 with sdss-r for red channel)\r\nBessell B 21 x 90 s (blue channel)\r\nBessell V 16 x 90 s (green channel)\r\nSo totally 1.85 hours of data stacked in Nebulosity 4 and processed in PS CS5",
