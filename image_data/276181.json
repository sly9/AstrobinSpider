    "description": "One of the most enduring mysteries of our satellite is its lack of magnetic field - which proved a real problem when it was discovered that the lunar rocks brought by astronauts in the 1960s and 1970s were magnetic. Did they have an alien origin? How is this possible?\r\nToday Science has discovered that the Moon used to have a magnetic capo, but a consensus has not yet been reached on what exactly made it disappear, with a dispute between two main theories. A team of researchers believes that this happened because of natural movements of the star's iron core, while the other argues that the disappearance must be related to a series of impacts with large space rocks.\r\nSource: MegaCurioso\r\n",
