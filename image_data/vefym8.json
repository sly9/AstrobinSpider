    "description": "Have seen this called both Blue and White Snowball.  The color is from the RGB, so IMHO it is blue.  O-III was used for L.  The drizzled version (here) was much better than the un-drizzled version.\r\n\r\nIt is very small: 1.1 Arc' in diameter on the long axis.\r\n\r\nThis nebula exhibits some evidence of an interaction with the interstellar medium, along with a characteristic central torus and outer halo.  It may be similar to NGC 2371, but older and with a less constrained wind.",
