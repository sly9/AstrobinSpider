The original parent shot spans an area 4°x4°, yet it captures only a portion of the vast nebula's central region. This crop and Crop 1 were essentially processed the same, and yet in this area the OIII is much more teal than the blue of Crop 1. This is why I present them separately. Individually they are each interesting and different; together they made the parent photo visually unapetizing, like a lasagna milkshake. \r\n\r\nI shot this using a Takahashi FSQ-106 that I rent from master astrophotographer Martin Pugh at his remote telescope hosting observatory in Australia. If you are interested in imaging the skies of the Southern Hemisphere, contact him.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.martinpughastrophotography.space/remote-imaging-and-telescope-hosting",
