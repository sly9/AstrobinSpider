    "description": "hello to all astronomical colleagues and friends, i finally got a hook on my current project. This is my longest so far and also the most intensive project. I took around 380 pictures of 5 minutes each in May and early June 2020. Of these, around 170 pictures are H-alpha alone.\r\nThe fact that the more exposure time is collected, the more data or details are available is remarkable.\r\nThe project showed me how much data I would like to collect in the future. It was fun to evaluate the data and I am reasonably satisfied with the result.\r\nthere is still a lot to learn, but especially when it comes to processing, there are a lot of things to do many possibilities. in Germany there is a saying ... \"many roads lead to rome\". this fact is based on availability various software extreme!\r\nI'm already looking forward to my next project. A big point in this hobby is, at least that is my opinion, to say ... now is good! that's it!\r\na difficult step, but a necessary one, because as soon as you look at your work again just two days later, you could change or \"optimize\" something here and there again. So there it is ...\r\nI hope you like the picture and I can take you into the depths of our milky way for a short moment.\r\n\r\nBest regards and clear skys\r\nDaniel",
