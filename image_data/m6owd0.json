    "description": "This is my best Saturn image of this year's apparition courtesy of the extraordinary seeing on July 31st. There is very good resolution of detail on the planet with considerable activity in the NNTeZ on the f side of the CM and the NPR. There is also a number of prominent small cells in the NEB, NTrZ & NTeB particularly on the p side of the CM.\r\nThe south polar region, just visible below the rings in the image, has a beautiful almost turquoise blue colour.",
