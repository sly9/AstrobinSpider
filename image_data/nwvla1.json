    "description": "I tried for the first time the \"trendy\" software \"Topaz sharpen\" for this image ; as many users do so now for their astro images.  \r\n\r\nThe process was only applied on the inner core of the galaxy, and with many precautions (mask, low % of blend with the original… ) and rigorous verification that no virtual detail is created during the process. In fact, it was used more like the \"sharpen\" tool of PS ; which can surely leads to the same result but with many iterations…\r\n\r\nFor this image, most of the detail come from classic deconvolution and HDR processing on Pixinsight ; Topaz was only useful to quickly give a \"sharpen\" aspect to the core of the galaxy. \r\n\r\nI think that used in that way, and with such precautions, it can be an interesting tool.\r\n\r\nJB",
