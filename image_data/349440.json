    "description": "This tiny distant object is a pair of colliding galaxies located 350 million light years away in the constellation of Coma Berenices.  \r\n\r\nI find many different aspects of this object to be interesting.  Unlike some Arp objects, there is no question that these two colliding galaxies are gravitationally interacting.  The long, extended star stream tails of each galaxy due to the galactic tides are fascinating.  Equally amazing are the numerous color changes across the object, from yellow to blue, and then back to yellow and finally back to blue again.  The dark lanes are unusually shaped.  A wide star stream connects the two galaxies.",
