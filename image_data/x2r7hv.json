    "description": "Composite image of Uranus and its large moons, including Miranda! :-)\r\n\r\nI used 6 ms exposure for Uranus, 500 ms for the moons. In both cases I used a gain of 425.\r\n\r\nThe final image is composed of three images: I had to crank up a lot the wavelets to get the extremely faint blob of Miranda, and the other moons were totally overblown, so mixed 2 versions of that image.\r\n\r\nActually I was surprised to get Miranda, couldn't see it during the capture. The position of the moons was confirmed on WinJupos (23:31 UTC).\r\n\r\nFrom Gurnigel in the Swiss Alps.",
