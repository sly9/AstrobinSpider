    "description": "A nice target that is often overlooked in favor of its big brother that lives next door. While I wouldn't say The Running Man is a cooler object than Orion, it is definitely under appreciated relative to how cool it is :) \r\n\r\nThis was quite an image to work on. Lots of reworking before I ended up with something I was happy with. Original version had much more emphasized Ha retention which is great from a scientific stand point, but when the whole background is burgundy, it kind of removes the aesthetic  factor. Went back and tried to \"remove\" that background dust to make the nebula itself pop more. Happy with the outcome, but I was wincing a bit since I love to retain Ha as much as possible. Had to be pretty though!",
