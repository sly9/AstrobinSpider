    "description": "Hi, üëãüåå‚ùÑ‚ú®\r\n\r\n\"Little Planet 360 ¬∞ and the Milky Way\".\r\n\r\nMy trip to Podlasie starts the alarm‚è∞ clock which makes noise after midnight. The equipment is loaded, hot coffee in the thermos and off you go. And all of Poland is sleeping üò¥. Despite driving on the ice rink‚ùÑ, two hours later I am there. Most of the tour is thinking about the frame. And this is my idea, \"if I go around and take pictures quickly, it will be a very interesting prospect\". As I thought so \"I did\" üòÅ. I caught up with the east of the spring Milky Wayüåå. It slowly crawls across the sky, illuminating Podlasie roadside shrines. A new cycle started in the firmament next spring. The constellation Cygnus strokes the tree. The summer triangle is quickly rising. Oh, it will be happening this year. I have such a hidden dream about Podlasie, maybe someone will turn off the lanterns in the villages one day, then there will be a bath in the stars.\r\n\r\nMarch 8, 2021 Spieszyn, Podlasie. POLAND \r\nCanon EOS R plus Sigma 28mm f1.4 ART\r\n60 x 15 s ISO3200 @ f1.8 Tripod.\r\n\r\nSocial:\r\nFB: @≈Åukasz ≈ªak ·¥æ·¥¥·¥º·µÄ·¥º\r\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/lukaszzak/",
