    "description": "This is one of my favorite regions in space to image because it contains so many cool things, including some of the coldest known regions in space as well as some of the hottest stars in our known universe!\r\nThis is a zoomed in view of the Rosette Nebula in narrowband color â€” more specifically, this view highlights dark splotches called \"Bok Globules\" seen in this region. Bok Globules are pockets of dark cosmic dust and gas, usually containing new born protostars, on their way to becoming fully fledged main sequence stars.  These small, dense clouds of dust and gas are some of the coldest places in the universe. They appear dark because they absorb the light from the more luminous background. The Bok Globules here are being created by the interstellar wind and radiation being blasted by the open star cluster called NGC2244, part of which can be seen at the top left corner of this image. This star cluster contains several rare blue-white O-type stars, which are some of the hottest and brightest stars in the known universe!",
