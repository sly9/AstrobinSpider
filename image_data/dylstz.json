    "description": "44 days of clouds, I'm running out to my car to grab something and I look up.....S$*T!!! I see stars!!!\r\nI run back in toss the gear outside, only my Esprit 80 was ready, fasted polar alignment in history and no moon. Slims pickings on what to shoot at the spur of the moment, but I found something on my list for later this year and the moon and weather cooperated. \r\n\r\nIt is just a quick integration, only managing just under 4 hours, but it was all around the zenith so decent seeing.  I was surprised to see so many faint galaxies, actually I was taken back. How vast the universe is even from this little patch of sky! \r\n\r\nI also grabbed 3 hours on M45 which I'm processing soon. Two quick targets one night, no sleep, and clouds are back. It was a frantic night, but that's what we do!\r\n\r\nCheers, be well, and Clear skies\r\nDan.",
