    "description": "15 million light years away and part of the Centarus collection. M83 has outperformed other spirals in terms of supernovae, and the strange distribution of mass around it's nucleus has led people to suggest that  there are two centres of mass. The bright blue suggests a lot of starburst activity and the dark lanes and HII regions are nicely picked out.\r\nThis is about 12 hours all up over two nights.",
