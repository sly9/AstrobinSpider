    "description": "An intermediate spiral galaxy is a galaxy that is in between the classifications of a barred spiral galaxy and an unbarred spiral galaxy. \r\n\r\nThis complex galaxy is inclined by an angle of about 53° to the line of sight from the Earth, which is oriented at a position angle of 172°. \r\n\r\nIt is categorized as a double-barred spiral galaxy with a small inner bulge through the core along with an outer bulge. The nucleus displays a weak level of activity of the LINER2 type. Variations in ultraviolet emission from the core suggest the presence of a supermassive black hole\r\n\r\nThe nuclear ratio of M96 is 5 arc-sec, with a separate outer bar with lenght of 1 arc-min as well ak inner disk with diameter of about 0.5arc-min\r\n\r\nThe galaxy lies at a distance of 31 million light years from Earth and has an apparent magnitude of 10.1. It has also the designation NGC 3368 in the New General Catalogue.\r\n\r\nMessier 96 has an apparent size of 7.6 x 5.2 arc minutes, which corresponds to a linear diameter of about 100,000 light years, making M96 roughly the same size as the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of this galaxy harbors a black hole with mass of about 7.5 million Suns.\r\n\r\nM96 is the brightest galaxy within the M96 Group, a group of galaxies in the constellation Leo that includes the Messier objects M95 and M105, as well as at least nine other galaxies.\r\n\r\nM96 \r\nConstellation:  Leo \r\nDec: 11deg 49min 12 sec\r\nAR:  10h 46m 45.75\r\nType: SAB(rs)ab\r\n\r\nReference:  \r\nAtlas of Galaxies\r\nBy Ronald J.
