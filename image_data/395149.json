    "description": "Last year we imaged M51 from home, using our newly acquired TEC 140 and QSI 690.  However, we were not able to go deep, before the TEC had to be packed up and taken out to Spain.  I thought that it would be fun to have another go from home using our Esprit 120 and Moravian KAF 8300 camera.  The wider field image allowed us to capture several more galaxies than we did in the earlier photograph.  \r\n\r\nThe Whirlpool Galaxy (Messier) is located some 27 million light years distant in the constellation of Canes Venatici. It was discovered by Charles Messier on 13 October 1773. In the New General Catalogue, M51 is designated NGC 5194 and its companion is NGC 5195.\r\n\r\nThis was imaged from home observatory in the UK between 15 February and 9 March 2019.  It consists of: \r\n\r\nLum: 48 x 600s\r\nRed: 24 x 600s\r\nGreen: 24 x 600s\r\nBlue: 24 x 600s\r\nHa: 20 x 1200s\r\n\r\nTelescope: Skywatcher Esprit 120\r\nCamera: Moravian G2-8300\r\nFilters: Chroma Ha and Baader LRGB\r\nMount: Mesu 200\r\n\r\nA total of 26 hours and 40 minutes exposure.",
