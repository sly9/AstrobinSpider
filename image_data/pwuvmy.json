    "description": "Discovered by Edward Barnard in 1885, the California Nebula (NGC 1499) is an emission nebula located in the constellation Perseus about 1,500 light-years from Earth. It is located near the Milky Way's Orion Arm and its size is 2.5° long on the sky or across 100 light-years of space. This cosmic cloud is named California Nebula based on its appearance resembling the outline of State of California. The nebula glows with the energetic starlight that ionizes much of the nebular gas because of the radiation from the intensely hot Xi Persei(aka Menkib) star, the brightest star in this image.\r\nThis is a Hubble Palette (SHO) narrowband imaging that NASA tends to use RGB mapping with Sulphur II, Ha, OIII filter data.\r\nResolution ............... 1.462 arcsec/px\r\nRotation ................. -179.227 deg\r\nObservation start time ... 2020-11-24 03:17:39 UTC\r\nObservation end time ..... 2020-11-29 12:41:32 UTC\r\nFocal distance ........... 530.48 mm\r\nPixel size ............... 3.76 um\r\nField of view ............ 3d 43' 23.5\" x 2d 27' 10.4\"\r\nImage center .............
