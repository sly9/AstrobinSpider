    "description": "This was a fun galaxy to process - I may go back and try to push the H-alpha a little more but I liked the yellow and blue tint of this one for now. There is a lot of structure in the core so tried to bring that out to the very center. Also fun to go \"faint fuzzy\" hunting on this one since it is at such a long focal length. Look forward to processing more images from the CDK17 before too long!\r\n\r\nSet the closest crop as the default revision but left the full field of view in case anybody wants to go exploring...",
