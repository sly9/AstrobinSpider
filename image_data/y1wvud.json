    "description": "Belated but the more inspired by fellow planetary photographers I have gathered all Mars images I took during autumn of this year 2020. Martian surface, Curiosity rover and MRO spacecraft images are courtesy NASA/JPL.\r\n\r\nSupplement: when you \"like\", please do not be distracted by the beautiful NASA images I used for decoration. My own work is merely the middle line-up of small Mars globes. Thanks so much to all of you!",
