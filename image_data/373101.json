    "description": "I find this image quite eerie in its semblance to a pointy-hat wearing wizard reclining with open arms drawing you into his enchanted embrace . . . [shivers sinister intent]. Located in the constellation of Cepheus this nebula has quite strong signals in each of the three NB channels and is a joy to process.\r\n\r\nI integrated data from a home observatory captured Wizard to boost the overall integration however the overwheliming bulk comes from e-Eye and the Tak FSQ106.  I removed stars using a star mask and morphological transformation and after some processing combined the deconvolved Ha channel as a luminance.  By leaving some remnant green within the colour data I find that it can enrich the Hubble Palette and bring some robust orange to the golden yellows.  It may not be to everyone's taste but I am favouring this palette now.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
