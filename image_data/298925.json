    "description": "* Image acquisition by: iTelescope-Portugal.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n\r\nThe Lobster Nebula is located in the Constellation of the Scorpion, is approximately 60 minutes in diameter and consists of HII regions, high mass stars (O and B), photodiodes regions and infrared sources.\r\n\r\nThe elegant structures it exhibits, result from interactions between stellar winds, magnetic fields, radiation pressure and gravity, and the brightness resulting from the emission of ionized hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe central, bubble-like region is separated by a column of dust that divides the region into two wells and exhibits diffuse emissions of OIII revealing that it is filled by hot gas (10^4 K), with the agglomerate Pismis 24 being the main source of excitation in this region.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n* <a href=\" https://www.astrobin.com/330450\"> Cat's Paw Nebula</a>.\r\n* <a href=\" https://www.astrobin.com/379289\"> Lobster and Cat's Paw Nebula</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://astrob.in/330450/0/\"><img src=\"http://astrob.in/330450/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>   <a href=\"https://astrob.in/379289/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/379289/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
