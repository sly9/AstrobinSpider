    "description": "Image taken in Atacama Desert.\r\n\r\nSeveral days in a row photographing the night sky at the Atacama¬¥s Desert. Great experience! In the moment I shot this picture I was alone, in the middle of nowhere, experimenting a scene that clearly looked like another world. The 33 feet sculpture 'Hand of the Desert ' helped to create an even more alien atmosphere. It was a unique photoshoot indeed.\r\n.\r\nIt was already pass 4:00 AM and a certain tiredness knoked my door. I started packing since I still would had two hours drive ahead. Just before leaving, I looked back and saw this wonderful scene forming: the hand almost \"touching\" Eta Carinae nebulae and the Southern Cross constellation! What a view!\r\n\r\nI pulled everything out and began the photographic process again, hoping to capture a unique view of our southern night skies, harmonizing with a gigantic sculpture.\r\n.\r\nWhat I liked most about this image is the pinkie almost \"touching\" Eta Carinae nebulae! üòÅ\r\n..\r\n.\r\n[ Tech Specs ]\r\n50mm lens | Canon 6D mod. | ISO 3200 | f4 | Porteble Eq Mount | Exposure 75\" sec\r\n#2 sky images;\r\n#1 landscape image;\r\n*All images taken in a immediate sequence, turning eq mount on and off.\r\n..\r\nChile - 04/2017",
