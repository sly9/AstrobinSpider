    "description": "NGC253 Sculptor Galaxy\r\nThe Sculptor Galaxy, named so because it is located in the Sculptor constellation, is also called the Silver Dollar Galaxy due to its appearance. It is over 11 million light-years from Earth and measures 90,000 light-years across. Because of its brightness it is a well studied galaxy, and is in the middle of a \"starburst\" period of star formation. Note the numerous and complex dust lanes. North is at the top.",
