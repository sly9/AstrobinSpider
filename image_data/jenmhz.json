    "description": "Sh2-301 is a small, but bright, nebula near Sirius.  It is usually overlooked by those searching for image-worthy nebulae along the southern Milky Way between Thorâ€™s Helmet and the Vela SNR.  In fact, an AstroBin search found only 2 posted images of it.  Despite its small size, it is rich in S, H, and O emissions, as well as interesting structures.  Please enjoy this portrait of Sh2-301 in an HST palette.",
