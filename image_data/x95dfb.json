    "description": "This was a difficult challenging image to process and I am not convinced I have made the best of our data of these dark and faint reflection nebula in Cassiopeia. Certainly more subs in each channel would have helped however the autumn and winter weather has given fewer clear nights in Spain than anticipated.  Thus, the final image is much more processed than is my normal preferred style . . . \r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
