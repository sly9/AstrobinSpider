    "description": "The Milky Way arches over the stadium-like volcanic remnant at Fort Rock in central Oregon. The ring, formed by underwater volcanic explosions some 50-100K years ago (yes, this dry sagebrush desert was all a 150-foot-deep lake back then, apparently), is about 0.8 miles in diameter and its walls reach over 300 feet high in places.\r\n\r\nThis is a 10-frame panorama taken in portrait orientation with a Canon 6D and Tamron 15-30mm f/2.8 lens at 15mm, f/2.8, ISO 6400, 30s exposures.
