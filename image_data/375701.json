    "description": "LDN 673 is located 650 light years away from us and seen against spectacular dense region of the Milky Way. Wasn't that excited about an imaging target for a while!\r\n\r\nThis area is a very active region or star formation and is swarming with Herbig-Haro objects! \r\n\r\nProbably the nicest one is HH32, located in the top right part of the nebula: it lies right on top of a bright star, which also forms a reflection nebula. The whole thing reminds me of a peculiar cosmic flower, and HH 32 nicely marks the top of it.",
