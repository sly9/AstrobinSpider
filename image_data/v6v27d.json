    "description": "first time imaging M106 for me. I really like the Ha results from this. I am so happy I was able to get the Ha. I accidently lost 10hours of subs due to a lack of sleep error! I had two lucky clear nights that I was able to recover the data. It took me 7 nights in total to image this object. between clouds and wind and only 6 hours of dark, it was a challenge! I like the Ha that is visible in the small NGC4248. Let me know what you think, always looking to improve!\r\n\r\nClear Skies \r\nDan.",
