    "description": "I was curious what a 2800mm focal length scope can do with M13. The faint stars around the cluster needed a long total exposure time. The full resolution image shows a number of tiny 18m..20m galaxies around the cluster and stars up to magnitude 21.5.\r\n\r\nThis image consists of 475 unguided exposures 120 seconds each, which were acquired on multiple nights during the last new-Moon period: 19-03-2020, 16-03-2020, 19-03-2020, 23-03-2020, 24-03-2020, 25-03-2020, 26-03-2020, 28-03-2020, 31-03-2020, 01-04-2020, 02-04-2020.\r\n\r\nThe color calibration was done using PixInsight's Photometric Color Calibration tool (being red color blind I have to rely on such aids :).\r\n\r\nComments are welcome and appreciated.\r\n\r\nBe safe and stay healthy!",
