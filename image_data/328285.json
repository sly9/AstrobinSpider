    "description": "Well, one star I guess.  This was  a joy to process until I got to the stars. Tried a semi-tonemap but the little buggers just kept coming back.  In a marathon tone mapping session I removed all of the stars and started to like it so I kept going.  Could resist adding back that O-type irradiating beauty to complete the scene.  Other version is with stars.\r\n\r\nWeb sites:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.stellarsolace.com/\">StellarSolace</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StellarSolace-1588021434610921/\">Facebook page</a>",
