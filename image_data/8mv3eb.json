Here is a link to their original paper.\r\nhttp://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1984PASP...96..283E\r\nEGB6 is an old and hence large planetary nebula with extremely low surface brightness.\r\n\r\nhttps://astrodonimaging.com/gallery/egb-6-faint-planetary-nebula-in-leo/\r\nEllis Grayson Bond (EGB) 6 is a large, planetary nebula in the constellation of Leo, having a size of 11' x 13' with low surface brightness. This faint nebula was discovered by Bond in 1984 from Palomar Sky Survey prints. It is 1,500 light years distant with an age of ~60,000 years. It has a very hot (110,000 K) white dwarf central star (WD0950 + 139), which has been the subject of much research regarding the evolution of stars and the formation of planetary nebula. Initial suggestions that this star may actually be a binary was validated recently with HST images.  \r\n\r\nThis star is easily visible as the tiny blue star in the center of the nebula.\r\n\r\nMy Collections:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2627/\" target=\"_new\">Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2626/\" target=\"_new\">Galaxies</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2625/\" target=\"_new\">Sharpless 2 Objects</a>",
