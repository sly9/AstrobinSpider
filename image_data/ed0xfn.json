    "description": "Edit: Roy Hagen spotted a facsimile of a green Vader down low, with prompted a title change. :)\r\n\r\nAs I was trying to set up and polar align prior to the moon set, I realized the aurora were very active.  This is a hastily taken image, but shows some completely different colours in the aurora, compared to my usual late night sessions.  \r\n\r\nThe moonlight is exposing the trees to an almost daylight hue.\r\n\r\nBlack Island is seen across the bay (4 km distant).  Around this island, the lake stretches north for several hundred km.",
