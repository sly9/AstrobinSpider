    "description": "Bicolor image of Thor’s Helmet. 22.5 hours of total exposure at 30 minutes each sub. It was taken in my backyard from my Observatory. This is the first narrowband only image that I have attempted. I’ve used Ha before with my LRGB data but that’s about it. Processing was somewhat a challenge, but it was a fun journey. Thanks for looking!",
