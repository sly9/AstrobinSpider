    "description": "Messier 103 - An open cluster in Cassiopeia. Discovered in 1781 by Pierre MÃ©chain, a friend and collaborator of Charles Messier. \r\n\r\nThis is one of the most distant open clusters known, at around 9,000 light-years from earth and approximately 15 light-years across.\r\n\r\nStar clusters although beautiful in their own right, can be a little boring to some, so I have done a little experimentation with a home made diffraction mask to add the Newtonian star pattern that many people seem to like, creating my own 'Newtonian Refractor' ;-)",
