    "description": "Continuing my imaging of Venus during the 2019-2020 evening apparition. \r\n\r\nThese images were captured on the night of April 18, 2020 (April 19 in UTC). Venus was ~35% illuminated in this image. The red channel uses data from an IR pass filter and the Blue channel uses data from a combined W47 Violet and BG-39 filter to capture some near-UV. The seeing was below average to average this night.  Was hoping to pick up some hint of cloud structure with the near-UV filter combo with the seeing a bit improved, but still hard to detect much in there...\r\n\r\nImaged with a C8 Evo, ZWO ADC, Baader IR 685nm pass and W47+UG39 filters, and ZWO ASI290MM. Imaging train was configured to give me ~F/20. Image capture using Firecapture (see below for exposure settings). Stacking in AutoStakkert3 (best 10% of ~50000 frames captured over 180 seconds). Color balancing and Wavelet sharpening in Registax6. Derotated and combined three images in WinJUPOS for both the W47+UG39 and IRpass filters.",
