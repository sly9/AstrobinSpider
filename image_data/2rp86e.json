    "description": "This was a very difficult image to process for me. Even with almost 60 hours of integration time, I had to really push the data. I guess that's why it is rarely attempted. \r\n\r\nPuWe 1 (PNG 158.9 + 17.8) is a pretty large (about 20 arc minutes diameter) planetary nebula in the constellation of Lynx. It makes it one of the largest planetary nebula in the sky. Its apparent diameter is 2.5 times larger than M27 Dumbbell planetary nebula. It is also one of the closest. It was discovered by Purgathofer and Weinberger in 1980 and is placed about 3500 light years away. Although quite large it is also very faint object, but as visual observers reported possible to see with Oiii filter. Nebula real diameter is about 4 light years.",
