    "description": "This target has been the quintessential pebble in my shoe.  I have tried several times to image this difficult gem, each time falling woefully short of my vision.  Noise has always been an issue, as well as LP, for M78 never rises above about 40 degrees for me, and 2/3 of the time it is visible it is awash in a nearby light dome.  This attempt I feel is the most respectable.  It contains data from two scopes (FSQ 106 and TOA 130), mostly the FSQ, with high detail areas being supplemented with TOA data (about 7 hours).  I do have the linear stacks, so there is the option of adding to this data--maybe with the C11Edge?  Or maybe keep adding to the wider field until all noise is suppressed entirely.  I love M78--it is up near the top of my DSO list, so I know I will keep shooting it.",
