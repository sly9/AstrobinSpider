    "description": "Galaxy 11 of (hopefully) 12 this galaxy season and the last galaxy image from my RC for a while. This was a fun one, but it was also rather difficult. I think I need a bigger scope...\r\n\r\nThere are so many galaxies in the background. I particularly like the galaxy cluster in the upper left part of the <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/full/byjhfu/0/>uncropped image</a>. If anyone has any additional information on that, I'd love to hear it.",
