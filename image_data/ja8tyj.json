    "description": "After 3 years mastering planetary imaging this have been the best I could get with my 8-inch telescope. To get to this point I tried to improve every step of the process: Get conditions for better seeing, a better camera and some good plug-ins for processing. Every planets have some unique details: A little bit of surface detail in Mercury, the cloud of Venus, on Mars there are some clouds, the bright Olympus Mons and South Polar Cap, Jupiter showing the GRS plus the recent NTB Outbreak #1, Saturn with amazing bands, detailed rings and the polar hexagon, some contrast in Uranus and finally the small Neptune.",
