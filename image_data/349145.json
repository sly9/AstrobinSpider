    "description": "This field of view contains several deep sky objects and therefore goes by various names.  Bernes 149 (B149) is the blue reflection nebula, also known as GN 16.05.2, in the midst of the dark nebula (Lupus 3).  \r\n\r\nThe dark cloud is one of the closest dark nebulae to us, located 500 light years away in the southern constellation of Scorpius.  The cold and dense dust particles of this dark cloud  absorb and scatter the background starlight.\r\n\r\nNew stars are forming in the dark cloud, including the brightest stars in the center of the image which are illuminating the blue reflection nebula.  The topmost bright star is seen by close inspection to be a double star.  Some artifacts surround the bright stars due to reflection patterns caused by my camera sensor cover.",
