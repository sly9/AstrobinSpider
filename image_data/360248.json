    "description": "Note 1. July-2019:\r\nThis image is still categorized as \"Lacking data\", one of 20 pics, which I don't understand?\r\nWhat is missing?\r\n\r\nThe NGC6826 LRGB frames/film sequences were quality sorted by Autostakkert.\r\n20% of the 1000 Lum frames were used in the stack. 40% of the 3x1000 RGB were used to stack.\r\n\r\nThe RegiStar program and Adobe Photoshop CS6 used for the processing effort.\r\n\r\nA FFC was used to increase the FL. The NGC6826 center picture is shown as/in size 100%.\r\nMore detailed exposure details can be provided if needed/requested.\r\n\r\nIn DK CPH it's summer time, 25->30 degrees centigrade during daytime and the nights are bright.\r\n\r\nMy home build observatory is placed in my front yard/in the \"red light\" polution zone, have a look here,\r\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/lnr3elrgm81uj0i/Light-polution-mapDK.jpg?dl=0\"; target=\"_new\">Red Zone</a>\r\n\r\nKind regards Niels",
