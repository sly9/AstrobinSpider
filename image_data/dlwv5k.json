    "description": "Although the session itself was a frustrating one (with variable transparency and seeing) the best of the images fortuitously captured the event I was hoping for: Ganymede emerging from Jupiter's umbra. <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/dlwv5k/B/\">This is best illustrated in the animation (rev B)</a> ... which also illustrates the variable conditions!\r\n\r\nGanymede is visible as a thin crescent in the main image, along with Europa (far left) and Io (far right).\r\n\r\nEach image is a single 2 min capture, with the best 15% of frames stacked.",
