    "description": "A Mars animation for almost 5:30 hours. Again, it was unfortunately very foggy in between and especially at the end of the night, but that's normal between the Danube and Isar and you shouldn't let that get you down. ðŸ˜Š\r\nThis time I was able to guide the recording. The last time it was almost impossible due to the moon, the guider failed.\r\nIt was very difficult to process evenly with the large number of pictures, which is why some of them look very over processed.\r\n362 GB! Data were processed for this recording. Every single batch consists of 50% that corresponds to 17500 images.\r\nHave fun and don't zoom too much ðŸ˜‰",
