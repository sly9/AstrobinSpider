    "description": "NGC 6820 is a small reflection nebula near the open cluster NGC 6823 in Vulpecula. The reflection nebula and cluster are embedded in a large faint emission nebula called Sh 2-86. The whole area of nebulosity is often referred to as NGC 6820.\r\n\r\nM27, the Dumbbell Nebula, is found three degrees to the east, and α Vulpeculae three degrees to the west.\r\n\r\nOpen star cluster NGC 6823 is about 50 light years across and lies about 6000 light years away. The center of the cluster formed about two million years ago and is dominated in brightness by a host of bright young blue stars. Outer parts of the cluster contain even younger stars. It forms the core of the Vulpecula OB1 stellar association.\r\n\r\nEmission Nebula NGC6820 with Open Cluster NGC6823\r\nRight ascension\t19h 42m 27.92s[1]\r\nDeclination\t+23° 05′ 14.7″[1]\r\nDistance\t6,000 ly[2] ly\r\nApparent dimensions (V)\t40arcmins\r\nConstellation\tVulpecula\r\nDesignations\tNebula (NGC 6820, Sh2-86)",
