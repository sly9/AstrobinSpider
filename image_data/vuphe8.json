    "description": "NGC 1313  is a field galaxy and a barred spiral galaxy discovered by the Scottish astronomer James Dunlop on 27 September 1826.  It has a diameter of about 50,000 light-years, or about half the size of the Milky Way.  NGC 1313 has a strikingly uneven shape and its axis of rotation is not exactly in its centre.  NGC 1313 also shows strong starburst activity and associated supershells.  NGC 1313 is dominated by scattered patches of intense star formation, which gives the galaxy a rather ragged appearance.  The uneven shape, the ragged appearance and the strong starburst can all be explained by a galactic collision in the past.  However, NGC 1313 seems to be an isolated galaxy and has no direct neighbours. Therefore, it is not clear whether it has swallowed a small companion in its past. (Wikipedia)\r\nWith nothing but cloudy nights and nautical twilight I wanted to process something in the Southern Hemisphere.  This data comes from Telescope Live, and I have processed it with Pixinisight.  I find this galaxy interesting and like that there is IFN around it, and I was able to pull some of it out.\r\nThe Telescope used was a ASA 500N, and camera was FLI Pl 16803.  Data is from El Sauce Observatory, Chile.",
