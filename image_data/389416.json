    "description": "The Jellyfish Nebula (IC 443, Sharpless 2-248) is a supernova remnant around 5,000 light years distant in the constellation of Gemini.  It is believed that the supernova occurred anywhere between 3,000 to 30,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nIC 444 is the nebulosity to the left of the Jellyfish in this image.   \r\n\r\nThis is a two panel mosaic, consisting of data that were collected between 31 December 2018 and 5 February 2019 from a remote imaging rig in Spain that is owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me. \r\n \r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nCamera: QSI 683 WSG\r\nFilters: Astrodon 5nm NB\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nSII: 42 x 1200s\r\nHa: 43 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 42 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 42 hours and 20 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage processing: Steve Milne",
