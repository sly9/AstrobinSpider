    "description": "Hi all - it's been a while. Apologies for absence and lack of support etc - life been getting in the way.\r\nHaving not opened PI for 6+ Months (so be kind :) )I thought I would start with something relatively straightforward to dust the processing down a little, sure there are a few errors.  Bits in Spain are taking shape so will have an abundance of data this year, best I get ready for that!\r\n\r\nThis data is from my friends over at SSRO and their archive from 2016.\r\n\r\nCheers",
