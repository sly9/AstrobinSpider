    "description": "Khan stated \"I'll chase him round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames before I give him up!\" (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)\r\n\r\nNGC 3572 is a star cluster situated near a molecular cloud in Carina about 6500 light year distance. These stars are young and massive and are only expected to live a few million years and explode as supernovae. These stars have shaped the clouds into amazingly convoluted shapes by their powerful radiation.(Eso)\r\n\r\n...and it's a pretty cool target - near the great Carina Nebula but not often photographed by itself.\r\n\r\nMapped S2>B, O3>R, Ha>G - RGB stars > colours tweaked a bit :)\r\n\r\nTaken from my light polluted backyard in Melbourne, Victoria- Australia",
