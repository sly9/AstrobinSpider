    "description": "Messier 78 is a reflection nebula in the Orion constellation (I call it the bug).  It is part of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex about 1,600 light years away.  Across Barnard's Loop is the Boogie Man Nebula (LDN1622); a dark nebula buried in a cloud of obscuring dust about 500 light years away.\r\n\r\nThis was captured on two nights in December.  I was cut short the first night when 3F temps caused my scope to frost over.  The next night I was clouded out after about an hour.  I would like to revist this area next year and maybe I will have better weather.  Anyway, here is my version of the Bug and the Boogie Man:\r\n\r\nCanon 6D modified\r\nISO 1600\r\n54 x 300 sec\r\nSV80ST at 480 mm f/6\r\nCEM60",
