Data is still a bit soft, but that's just what I get to live with for trying to push 0.63\"/pixel in my skies. \n\nProcessing was pretty standard overall\n\nPreprocessing\n\n* Calibration using WBPP\n* SubframeSelector\n* StarAlignment\n* ImageIntegration\n* Drizzle (2x, vark 1.5, dropshrink 0.7)\n\nL Channel\n\nA superlum was created by integrating R, G, B, and L using ImageIntegration with NoiseEvaluation for weighting.\n\n* Crop\n* DBE\n* Deconvolution\n* MMT for sharpening\n* IntegerResample to bring back to original pre-drizzle resolution\n* TGVDenoise\n* MMTDenoise\n* HistogramTransformation for stretch\n* One round of DBE for some lingering gradients\n* FastRotation for a more natural angle\n* MMT for some final denoise\n\nR/G/B Channels\n\n* DynamicCrop\n* DBE\n* BackgroundNeutralization\n* ColorCalibration\n* IntegerResample to pre-drizzle size\n* TGVDenoise\n* MMTDenoise\n* HistogramTransformation\n* FastRotation\n* LRGBCombination with L channel (Chrominance Denoise enabled)\n* Invert + SCNR on stars to remove magenta artifacts\n* Curves\n* MLT for some final sharpening & denoise",
