    "description": "Image taken for fun with my friend Antonio Ruggeri (http://www.astrobin.com/users/Realchemyst/) who bought a new Nikon D750 camera with a Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 G lens and wanted to test it on the night sky. We decided to go to a place not so far from home and we took 81 x 30s exposures on the Milky Way, using a Nano Tracker to avoid blurred stars, and a single 30s exposure without sideral tracking for the landscape. The image has been calibrated and processed according to my usual PixInsight workflow. Antonio made aesthetics improvements using Photoshop and Raw Therapee. Sebastiano Recupero.",
