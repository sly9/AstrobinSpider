    "description": "Far sooner than I expected, I had a clear sky last night and was able to capture SII and OIII data for a Hubble palette interpretation of the Cave Nebula.  I do like the way that the dark blue-black  cloud seems to be enveloping the nebula.\r\n\r\nI've gone for the moody look, leaving a touch of green in the tone and trying to make the 'cave' area more luminous and mysterious, LOL :-).\r\n\r\nNow time to pack up gear and stow away for a remote setting.",
