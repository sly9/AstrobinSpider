    "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite object in NB, I have been so many times impressed by the images of the best photographers on this one. Wanted to make a try by myself.\r\nHa was rather good after 4 hours but I did not manage to get a strong enough signal with the OIII filter. Still interesting to try to mix with Ha.\r\nI will surely have to come back to this one a couple of times before getting better results.\r\n\r\n16x15min each, Ha & OIII",
