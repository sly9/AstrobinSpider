    "description": "I just received a ZWO ASI1600MM-C and want to test it. The weather was bad; that’s why I manage to shoot for only 21 minutes. I wasn’t expecting such a result with only 7 exposures of 1 minute for each filter! I tried to keep the noise under control.\r\nThis is my first narrowband image. Suggestions are appreciated!",
