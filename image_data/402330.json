    "description": "The Great Carina Nebula under a highly populated area and full Moon. The Carina nebula is one of my preferred deep sky objects for it is very large and contains several embedded structures, including bright and dark nebulae and star clusters. It also contains the Eta Carina star, a star with an anomalous behavior that may explode in the upcoming years (or millions years).\r\nThis photo was just a quick test with Hydrogen alpha and RGB filters. I had less than 40 minutes to take the photo before some cirrostratus clouds appeared in the sky.",
