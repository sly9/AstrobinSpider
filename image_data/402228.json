    "description": "Jupiter on the morning of Easter Sunday AEST.\r\n\r\nHad an almost 3 hour long imaging session between 2:15 and 5:00 am local time. Alternated between Jupiter and Saturn with majority of recordings ahead of meridian crossing. Yet to crunch through Saturn data but for Jupiter best period was definetly before 3 am. There was some speckled cloud about early on but it cleared in time for this capture.\r\n\r\nWinJUPOS composite of five 80 second stacks between 2:21 and 2:27 am Canberra time.\r\n\r\nOval BA is crossing CM with GRS rising in the west. Unfortunately seeing degraded as the night progressed so could not maintain similar level of quality for later derotations (inability to reach focus at this F ratio).",
