    "description": "As a sun-like star begins to deplete itâ€™s hydrogen fuel, a sequence of interesting change is initiated. The core, unable to support its own crushing gravity, compresses and increases dramatically in temperature. In an opposite fashion, the outer atmosphere swells and cools under the intense pressure from within. A red giant is born.\r\n\r\nThough there are several possible outcomes, many stars begin to gradually shed the outer atmosphere to deep space. This is the beginning of a planetary nebula.\r\n\r\nAs the core continues its collapse it emits extreme ultraviolet radiation. The radiation ionizes the gasses of the nebula giving rise to a wonderfully colorful and intricate design.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the stellar parent is a binary star system. This pair, one dying, sculpts a unique and beautifully complex nebula. Romantic or cannibalistic?\r\n\r\nAs always, enjoy and let me know what you think in the comments!",
