    "description": "This is the third time I've imaged this object this Summer.   However it's the first time I've\r\nimaged it with my Orion ED80 refractor.  I had no idea what I was going to image or even if I was going to do any imaging.  I actually set \r\neverything up just to play with a Bahtinov Mask and my ED80.   I've not used my ED80 in a\r\nwhile and I just wanted to get a little practice with it.  Last night I attempted to get an image\r\nusing my ED80.  I took 70 light frames to align and stack with my darks and bias in Deep Sky\r\nStacker.   However Deep Sky Stacker  could not process my light frames.  The program could only find 7 stars in 70 light frames.  This has happened before  and it turned out to be  a focus problem.  I guess my\r\neyes are getting old because as I was taking the images they appeared to be in focus.    Anyway\r\nI picked a bright star tonight and pointed my scope with the Bahtinov mask on it at the star.\r\nI kept taking images and adjusting the focus until the Batinov Mask indicated I had good focus.\r\nI marked my focus tube with a pencil and then decided I would take some images of NGC 6960.\r\nAfter taking 25 images clouds moved in and covered the sky.   Anyway to make a very long story\r\nshort  I ran my lights, darks, and bias frames through Deep Sky Stacker tonight and had no\r\nproblems.   So that is the image that you see here.   Please enjoy my most recent image of \r\nNGC 6960.",
