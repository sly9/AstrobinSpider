    "description": "This is a pretty colourful and wild-looking part of sky.   I believe that the area is best described as a very faint nebula complex located in Monoceros, about 2700 light-years away.   The field is filled with dusty streamers throughout, and black ribbons of dark nebula radiating outwards.   It also contains areas of glowing red emission and several beautiful blue reflection nebulae.  \r\n\r\nNGC 2170 is the bluish nebula on the extreme left side.  Just to the right and slightly down, an area that resembles glowing embers surrounded by three nebulae with reds and blues.  Near the centre of the image, there is another blue reflection nebula, NGC 2182.  At the lower right-hand side, NGC 2183 is just entering the frame.  Unfortunately, my instrument’s narrow field of view does not allow this nebula to be presented in its entirety.  I just couldn’t bring myself to crop it out as it’s such an incredible looking nebula, and I believe that it adds a bit of mystery to just what lies outside the frame.  I must come back to this area and image that intriguing object.\r\n\r\nThe areas that I find most attractive and striking are the blue reflection nebula.  Their properties, precisely the particle size that makes up the dust preferentially, reflect blue light from the nearby hot stars.  This combination produces that beautiful blue glow seen in many astrophotography.\r\n  \r\nThere are glowing red areas throughout the frame.  They are emission nebula.  The ultraviolet light from nearby stars interacts and excites the nearby hydrogen gas, causing these areas to emit light.  Other types of gas also emit light of their own in colours determined by the composition of the gas.  Perhaps the most striking features are the dark or absorption nebula.  The absorption nebula is seen in silhouette, blocking the light from behind.  From our vantage point, we see black.  Near-Infrared imaging reveals telltale signs of ongoing star formation and massive young stars that are hidden by dust, and not seen in traditional RGB optical images like this.\r\n\r\nInstruments:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\nLum 40 X 900\r\nRed 18 X 450 Binned 2\r\nGreen 18 X 450 Binned 2\r\nBlue 18 X 450 Binned 2\r\nHa 20 X 1800\r\n\r\nTotal Time 26.75 hours\r\n\r\nLocation\r\nAustralia, Central Victoria",
