    "description": "This was one of those projects, that took over a year to finish. Unfortunately my view is totally blocked with houses to the south, leaving me with just about 2 hours per night to capture this object. With endless bad winter weather in the last two years capturing was a nightmare. Luckily my Friend <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/Daniel_Pazman/\">Daniel Pázmán </a> gave me his APO data so I could go all in on the California nebula.\r\n\r\nSo here is a combination of RASA 8\" and his ES 80ED APO data, with stars only from the RASA. Processing on the other hand was super fun, finally a bright target to work with. \r\n\r\nImage acquisition: Daniel Pázmán  & Yannick Akar\r\nImage processing: Yannick Akar\r\n\r\nPS: I can't decide on the orientation, what is your favourite?",
