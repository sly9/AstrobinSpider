    "description": "This is my first try at processing data from the Hubble Legacy Archive. This image is made from the data obtained in 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescope, using F658N, F814W, F555W and F345W filters as Ha, R, G and B respectively.\r\n\r\nDetails obtained by the HST are astonishing, take the time to look at the full resolution image of this galaxy if you never did before, just impressive!\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
