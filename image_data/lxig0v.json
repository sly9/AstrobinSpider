    "description": "I had very good conditions last night for this capture of Jupiter. A heavy fog rolled in which started to affect the captures and scuttled my plans for Saturn. That is unusual for me at 960m altitude. However, the fog was even heavier by 4am such that it was impossible to capture Mars.\r\nIn any case for this series, the seeing was excellent and I got really nice detail on Europa in front of the planet, having integrated the first RGB run when the seeing was best. Some subtle detail is visible on the moon's surface with the benefit of avoiding the diffraction ring at the limb. I applied some gamma to darken the limb which I think gives the planet a more natural look.\r\nThere is a bright linear feature in the STB between the Oval BA and GRS, although it does not appear to show in IR.",
