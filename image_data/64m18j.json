    "description": "Sh2-73 is a visible reflection nebula in the constellation of Hercules.  It was mistakenly included in the Sharpless catalog as an emission nebula. We now know that the nebula is simply a molecular cloud. With its relatively high galactic latitude, about 45Â°, the integrated light of the galaxy illuminates the nebula. Therefore, we can refer to Sh 2-73 as an integrated flux nebula, as defined by Steve Mandel.\r\n\r\nSh2-73 is one of the closest clouds to the solar system, being just 200 parsecs away (about 650 light-years); it is located at a very high galactic latitude and does not appear associated with any bright star, nor are star-forming phenomena active in it.",
