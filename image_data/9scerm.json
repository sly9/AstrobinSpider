    "description": "Light frames were acquired between August 30th and October 30th 2019.\r\nNarrowband color: HSO\r\nStars: RGB\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStarsâ€™ Lifecycles Play Out in One Patch of Sky\r\n\r\nSh2-221 and Sh2-216 resulted from different types of star deaths. Sh2-221, at an approximate age of 6,000 years old, is a supernova remnant (SNR). The planetary nebula (PN) Sh2-216, aged at nearly 500,000 years old, has grown exceedingly dim, and its fuzzy edges indicate that it is beginning to dissipate. SNR Sh2-221 is roughly 2,600 ly away and about 130 ly across, while PN Sh2-216 is approximately 400 ly away and 11 ly wide. Therefore, PN Sh2-216 is much closer and smaller in actual size than SNR Sh2-221.\r\n\r\nSh2-217, Sh2-219, and BFS 44; the three smaller emission nebulae, are all part of the same star forming region.",
