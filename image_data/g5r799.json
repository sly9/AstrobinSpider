    "description": "The famous Pillars of Creation in M16.\r\n\r\nThis was a effort in learning some new techniques in PixInsight, particularly, tone mapping for the NB masters. I also did the calibration and stacking using Astro Pixel Processor (APP) which I am enjoying. \r\n\r\nI had wanted to add in RGB stars (which I took) but I couldn't get them to look right - too bloated and caused horrible halos.  NB subs taken over the period 7/19/2020 to 9/7/2020.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Added in the RGB stars (as best as I could).",
