    "description": "Original: \r\nNight 1 data. I'm mostly seeing what I have. Getting green and purple in the image that's been a pain to remove, but data looks good so far.\r\nB:\r\nFound a video by Visibledark Asto to fix the green and purple in the image. Worked perfectly.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVbfsHwCAbQ\r\nD:\r\nBoosted color a bit. Added color dodge to give it a bit of a glow. Not sure if I like this better, but it will be replaced after I get more data anyway.\r\nE:\r\nAfter Night 2 of imaging. I over stretched the images on this one and lost a lot of data. I'll be trying a new processing method next time so haven't fixed it yet.\r\nF:\r\nNew method from Visbledark Astro found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5zsZbHXrFE\r\nI'm not sure if I'm a fan of the stars and there seems to be a lot of noise. I'll work on combining our methods for the next revision.\r\nG:\r\nMix between my old method and some items from the new one. I'm not really sure what looks good anymore.\r\nH:\r\nI think this is going to be it for a while. More data added and reprocessed. The colors don't pop as much as previous pictures, but I kind of like it that way.",
