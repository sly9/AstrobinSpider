    "description": "\r\nOne of the strangest formations on the Moon is the long, narrow crater Rheita E. It is located in the south-eastern quadrant of the Moon, inside a triangle formed by the craters STEVINUS, REICHENBACH, and RHEITA (from which it derived its name). Its unusual shape resembles a bottle of Coke, from our point of view on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe irregular crater Rheita E appears to have been created probably by a fragmented asteroid, which caused 3 simultaneous impacts. The impacts created at the same time 3 overlapping craters, since there are no walls between them.\r\n\r\nRheita E is very reminiscent of another strange elongated lunar crater, much larger than it, called SCHILLER (dimensions: 179 km X 71 km), located in the southwest quadrant, near the lunar south pole.\r\nSource: VTOL (Vaz Tolentino Lunar Observatory)",
