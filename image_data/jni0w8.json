    "description": "I started this project more than one year ago.\r\nI threw in a lot of the data that I had available.\r\n\r\nLast season I first tried to capture 3 panels from the belt to the M42 with the Esprit 80 and a Canon 6D. Goal was achieved and I got this: https://www.astrobin.com/398170/\r\n\r\nThis season I continued and I added ~20h with the Esprit and the 6D in multiple panels with \"portrait\" and \"landscape\" orientation. Meanwhile, when I didn't travel to dark sites, I captured from home the same area in Ha with the 72ED and the ASI1600. ~18h of various orientated panels.\r\nAfter capturing at least 3-4h of DSLR data for each panel combination, I figured out I still had some time to try to shoot some luminance with the 72ED and the ASI1600, covering the same area I did for the hydrogen. So I managed 1h x 9 panels of luminance too which I combined with the luminance extracted from the RGB.\r\n\r\n6h with the 130PDS and ASI1600 were used for the M42 area. Original processed image: https://www.astrobin.com/385168/\r\n\r\nWith all my efforts to keep things well organized, I find it very hard to describe in detail how all the panels were planned, combined and processed.\r\nIn total I spent over 100h exposing this area and not everything went in the final image.",
