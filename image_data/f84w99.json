    "description": "This vast edge-on barred spiral galaxy is located 13 million light years away and gets lost a bit among all these stars. However, it has many dark areas and regions rich in young stars which gives a real festival of colors. It is considered very similar to our Milky Way, but its particularly bright center suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole that devours matter and ejects energy into space.",
