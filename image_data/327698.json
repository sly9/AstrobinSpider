    "description": "This is a combination of a data set taken with my NP127a while in Manhattan KS and data sets taken with a RH305 and a RCOS 14.5\" both located at DSW. The rotations were fairly close (modulo 90Ëš) so they were quite compatible.  The FSW provided the smallest FOV so it was the basis of the final crop.  The FOVs for the data sets were FSQ 1d56m18.4s x 1d27m33.7s, NP127is 2d20m33.9s x 1d52m27.1s and RH305 1d53m20.2s x 1d53m20.2s x2.  While the necessary crop preserved IC1805, IC1795 ended up on the cutting room floor.",
