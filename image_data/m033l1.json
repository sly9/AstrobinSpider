    "description": "Nested between the well-known constellations Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, and Cygnus – which are teeming with frequently imaged DSOs – is the small constellation of Lacerta. It contains no Messier objects and just one Caldwell object (C16, an open cluster), but despite this seeming lack of DSOs, there is a huge yet faint hidden gem. The massive HII emission nebula known as Sh2-126 spans several degrees of sky, beyond the bottom of my framing. The most prominent molecular cloud near the center is known as LBN 437, which features an interesting hourglass-shaped reflection nebula around the variable star V0375 Lac (<a href=\"https://srv2.zoomable.ca/viewer.php?i=img3b5f69dc8ca9c95a_sh2-126_resize\" target=\"_blank\">best viewed with zoom</a>). LBN 442 is the molecular cloud to the left of it and LBN 448 is in the upper left corner.",
