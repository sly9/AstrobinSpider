    "description": "This is a much nicer wide field target but I thought if the dark-lanes in the nebula can be resolved more.. but I am not sure it is worth the effort.\r\n\r\nI started the target with just Ha data and the weather turned. I managed to grab RGB data instead of OIII. The data itself is not  very good , especially the stars. With summer storms, I don't think I will spend more time on this target so ended up processing the sub par data.\r\n\r\nThis shot at unity gain at a image scale of 0.28arcsec/px",
