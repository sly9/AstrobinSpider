    "description": "In the main picture I inserted an old photo taken by  me of the Orion Nebula and  The Running Man  about 2  years ago, revised a bit as an elaboration. I have also included part of my lrgb photo, which I have not yet finished, which takes up the area of the sky between the Flame Nebula and the Horse's Head. I made these two shots with a 600mm / 80mm semiapochromatic refractor brought to 510mm. The rest of the photo I did with a 200mm focal length lens. I used a CCD camera with an integrated filter wheel and equipped with the monochrome kaf 8300 photosensor  which, thanks to its rather small pixels, gives me images with great details while using very modest focal lengths.\r\nFor the Orion Nebula, The Running Man, the Flame Nebula plus 3 blue nebulae I used the simple lrgb technique. For the rest, it was of fundamental help to have done 30 photos  of 30 minutes with a 6nm H alpha filter using the f / 4 telephoto lens, so still very bright.\r\nIn the technical data I entered only the shooting time   I used using the telephoto lens. If you want to consider also the time of the other 2 photos is this: Orion Nebula  12,2 hours and for the photo not completed  17 hours.",
