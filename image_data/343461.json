    "description": "A beautiful gem of an interacting galaxy, grabbed while the UK finally started to warm up and my garden burst into Spring.  We've returned to cloud for the time being however this image will form a good base for whatever I may be able to capture over the coming weeks.\r\n\r\nI keep telling myself that I ought to invest in a small pixel Sony ccd as there are some great examples of refractor/Sony ccd combinations from imagers.\r\n\r\nThis image has a hefty crop and I'll post up the full frame for comparison.",
