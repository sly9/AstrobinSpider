    "description": "NGC 4567 i NGC 4568 - this is pair of interferring galaxies from Virgo constellation. Sometimes we called them Simaese Twins or Butterfly galaxies.\r\nBoth objests are interferring but not so agresively like other galaxies which we know from Arp catalogue. \r\nBoth objects has quite well shaped and not distrotred spiral arms. In Poland both galaxies are on 49 degrees of altitude (maximum) so in good seeing conditions we can reveal some nice detail within them.\r\nIt's brigtness is 12,1 and 11,7mag and size around 4' x 3,5' (both galaxies)\r\n\r\nThis photo maybe is not technically perfect - but it is and will be unique in our times scale.\r\nWhy?\r\nBecause it contains sign of supernova SN 2020fqv which is visible now in NGC4568 and which will fade out really soon. Light of this supernova travelled to us for a long, really long time. It exploded in there distant area 52 millions year ago. And we are observing it now, for few short weeks, and then it will fade out and the only sign of its existence will be our photos which we are doing now, many millions years after its death...\r\nOr maybe not? Maybe we will se it once more. After few hundreds, thousands or million years - as a powerfull pulsar or giant black hole - during our trip into that area using our quantum engines and spaceships ;) Who knows ;)\r\n\r\nEquipment & exposure:\r\n\r\nNewton 350/1400 on EQ6 + ASI 178MM-C\r\nL: 700 x 12s (gain 82%)\r\nRGB: 300 x 15s (gain 82%) per channel\r\ncoma corrector Baader MPCC Mark III\r\nnative setup scale:  0,35''/pix",
