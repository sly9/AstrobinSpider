    "description": "We get a beautiful quadruple header with this view.  The reflection nebula Sh2-9, globular cluster M4,  the bright star Sigma Scorpii, and magnitude 1.1 Antares.\r\n\r\nWhat we don't see are any galaxies.  This is a really large area of sky with not a single galaxy, that I could find.  Quite unusual for a 1.3 degree view.\r\n\r\nSh2-9, also called Gum 65 is combination emission and reflection nebula in the Scorpius constellation, surrounding the multiple star system Sigma Scorpii. The nebula is a few arc minutes to the northeast to Messier 4, and can be easily seen by small telescopes.\r\n\r\nSharpless 9 is a red emission nebula that surrounds the star Sigma Scorpii. It is thought the star Sigma Scorpii, a variable giant star, is ionizing this region.  It is also recorded as reflection nebula C130.\r\n\r\nThis region is noted as both an emission and reflection nebula, although sometimes only one aspect is noted.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude 1.1 Antares is also relatively nearby to this nebula.\r\n\r\nMy Collections:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae (Complete)</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2627/\" target=\"_new\">Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2626/\" target=\"_new\">Galaxies</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2625/\" target=\"_new\">Sharpless 2 Objects</a>",
