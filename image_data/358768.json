The processing goal was to try to bring out as much faint nebulosity as reasonably possible, thus the image appears to have a ground glass appearance from the large amount in the region. This method does tend to washout the colors a bit but to the advantage of bringing faint detail to light. Adding H-alpha to the red channel and some to the blue channel intensifies the delicate HII clouds in the region.\r\n\r\nvdB154: Size (arcmin): 12\r\nType: illuminating star inside nebula\r\nSurface brightness: faint\r\nColor: blue\r\nAbsorption: moderate\r\nIlluminating star ID1: BD+64 1677\r\nMag. of illuminating star: 9\r\nSpectral type of star: B2IV",
