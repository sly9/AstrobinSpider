    "description": "The Andromeda Galaxy also known as M31 with its two companions M32 and M110. M31 is the largest member of our local galaxy group which contains a few dozen galaxies, most of them dwarf galaxies.\r\nThis was first light for the AP 305RHA. I got carried away a bit on the integration time but the result speaks for itself. What an incredible scope.",
