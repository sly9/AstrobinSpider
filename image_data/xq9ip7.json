    "description": "My friend Ben (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6-9ML4N16flcsEVHEKKPw?\">Ben's Astrophotography</a>)  flew 4 hours, borrowed my equipment and drove 6 hours to x bar ranch to setup the fun. \r\n\r\nThis 6-7 hours acquisition work is to his credit and I only did the post processing part. He is so gifted that he could operate his Tak e180 imaging rig as well as this one at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe result worth at least 25+ hours if it's taken from my class 8 backyard.",
