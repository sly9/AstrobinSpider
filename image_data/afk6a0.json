    "description": "The partial solar eclipse on 10th June 2021 was a big adventure for me and my family. My image shows nearly the highest amount of overlay of the moon at my location. \r\nI struggeld a lot with processing the image in case of the speed of the moon. I compared eight different stacks to show the most of the details. It is not perfect, but I like it to remember on this great day together with my wife and my oldest son.",
