    "description": "My favorite object - finally imaged under a reasonable (SQM 21.30) sky with the TS65apo. \r\nThe interesting part during imaging was that the little village of Caseneuve - at a distance of about 10km - was having a party with laserbeams in the sky / flashing through the imaging field!\r\nI remember I was pretty upset about that but honoustly I cannot say it affected the final picture",
