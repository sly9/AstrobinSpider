    "description": "Capturing the end of Europa's transit (moon above in the 2h position) and  Io move away fulfilling the orbit after occultation. Albedo marks are visible on both moons.\r\nThe disarrangement in the northern equatorial belt is very active and generated a very interesting movement to be photographed.\r\nRegarding the conditions for capture, there was good seeing moments. The Meteoblue pointed out a bad jetstream situation but the weather conditions were favorable at night, and this capture window was a really good time!",
