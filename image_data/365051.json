    "description": "Here is IC1805 central region in HOO. Sometimes people ask me what does it mean HOO? I’m trying to explain it as like this, HOO is essentially an RGB image when Red was substituted with Ha, Green with O3 and Blue with the same O3. And the colors you see here are not how it looks in nature. After that someone who's never been into this hobby usually asks, how you do it? we also want to do it. Well, I don’t have an easy answer to that question, too much stuff involved. All my detailed descriptions sound very vague for anyone who is not involved in astro-imaging. Anyway, back to this image. My first rendition of this object was not much about colors, but more about details, it looked much more humble, less saturated, faded look, even a bit blurry. Fortunately for me, that first version underwent scrutiny from my immediate family members. They said, why it’s so dull? You should make it brighter, bring some light to it, bright images look better, where are all the colors hiding?, bring up some colors, more colors, make it brighter and more colors. Well, I just tried to keep up with their demands.",
