    "description": "If you’re as much of a fan of Star Trek as I am, then you probably remember my favorite episode from season 1 of the Next Generation called “Where No One Has Gone Before,” in which the alien known as “The Traveler” ends up taking the Enterprise to Messier 33. As the scene goes:\r\n\r\nPICARD: Position, Mister La Forge. \r\nLAFORGE: Well, sir, according to these calculations, we've not only left our own galaxy, but passed through two others, ending up on the far side of Triangulum. The galaxy known as M33. \r\nPICARD: That's not possible. Data, what distance have we travelled? \r\nDATA: Two million seven hundred thousand light years. \r\nPICARD: I can't accept that. \r\nDATA: You must, sir. Our comparisons show it to be completely accurate. \r\nLAFORGE: And I calculate that at maximum warp, sir it would take over three hundred years to get home. \r\n\r\nThat’s not that long when you consider it took the photons from the Triangulum Galaxy 2.7 million years to reach my scope. On the other hand, it took me only 21 hours to capture this image. Perhaps I ought to start referring to my telescopes as transwarp corridors...",
