    "description": "I find it fascinating that this super nova remnant is almost 10 light years across, and only about a 1,000 years old...thats a fast rate of expansion.  It looks small, but if our nearest stellar neighbor went supernova and genrated a nebula like the Crab, it would take only a few hundred years before our solar system was engulfed.  The \"brain stem\" feature is visible at upper left-an OIII extension that is quite dim.\r\n\r\nI decided to post this SHO palette image on its own page becuase I think the bicolor HaOIII M1 deserves a post of its own....I have never really been partial to the SHO palette for M1.  I think this image suffers from a low resolution Ha channel.  Seeing was very poor for Ha, but good for OIII and SII.  Shame",
