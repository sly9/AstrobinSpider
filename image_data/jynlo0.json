    "description": "CouldnÂ´'t help it but to make a comparison with the famous HST image. I cropped and further processed my previous image of M16, to approach the HST's image tonalities. Image taken with an AP167 fluorite triplet refractor, and a QHY600 camera. Amazing what one can achieve with relatively modest equipment from a suburban backyard.",
