    "description": "This is a deeper version of my prior image located <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/rmb5hi/B/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nSince this is an all-new processing, I thought it might be better to leave the original as is for reference. (-:\r\n\r\nThis image actually has less processing... far less noise reduction and no yellow added to the core as I did in the prior version. I also just applied a mild star shrink to only the bigger stars, rather than the entire image,  to help preserve the tiny galaxies.\r\n\r\nI think what you see here is a more faithful representation of the photons seen by the CCD. This includes CCD artifacts that I'll leave to the experts to find. (-:",
