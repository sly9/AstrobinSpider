    "description": "My first clear night at 1600m in Styria was directed to the giant nebula complex IC 1396 hosting - among others - the Elephant's Trunk. Due to transport limitations, I only had my (new) little Lacerta 72/432 with me (a nice piece of equipment btw ;-)  -- therefore the choice of a widefield object, which was also a test for the full frame capabilities of the little photo refractor.\r\n\r\n(Had to reduce the size of the image due to the 70MB limit of Astrobin)",
