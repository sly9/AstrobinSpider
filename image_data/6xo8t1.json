    "description": "A widefield of Andromeda Galaxy, captured over a few nights from my remote observatory at ICAstro. The dark skies, object altitude and sensitive camera with big pixels (3.2\"/pix) have allowed us to reach deep in to Andromeda. The visibile extent of the galaxy is much larger than it firs appears. The outer reaches are very faint indeed....as if Andromeda could be faint?! You can see some very faint stuff in the upper right and lower left of the image.\r\nIt is well known that M31 is heading towards us, but recently it was discovered that our outer halo's are already interacting. Standby for fireworks!......",
