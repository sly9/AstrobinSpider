    "description": "An alternative edit to my previous image of the Rosette Nebula.\r\n\r\nCaptured on 24 December 2020 using the Telescope Live CHI-4 astrograph located at the El Sauce Observatory in the Rio Hurtado Valley, Chile, South America the final result comprises 2hrs of total integration and was post processed using colours which are more commonly referred to as The Hubble Palette, or SHO.\r\n\r\nNamed after the famous Hubble Space Telescope's â€‹Pillars of Creation (see profile picture), this palette maps Sulphur-II to Red, Hydrogen-Alpha to Green and Oxygen-III to Blue, with no special combinations in any channel.\r\n\r\nThere are endless possibilities on how to combine different colours representing different elements, and often the assigned colours represent wavelengths that are outside the visible spectrum. The Pillars of Creation image, however, set a standard for colour mapping that is now widely copied, including by myself",
