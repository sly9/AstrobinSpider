    "description": "IC4685 can be found in the constellation of Sagittarius.  For reference, the Lagoon Nebula is only 1.25 degrees away.  The estimated distance is about 4000 light years away.  The image includes a dense star cloud with many colourful stars, and both emission and reflection nebula.    \r\n\r\nNGC 6559 located in the lower left part of the image resembles an oyster.   IC4685 has that dark snaky river flowing through the nebula in the lower part of the image.  A Hydrogen Alpha filter was used to get that nice contrasty look, highlighting the delicate filaments of the black rivers running through the nebula.\r\n\r\nMy favourite part of the image is IC1274 located just to the right and up from centre.  It includes subtle milky white structures running across, a complete contrast to the dark river like areas in the lower left part of the image.",
