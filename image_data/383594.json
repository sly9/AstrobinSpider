    "description": "Because of the Mars Opposition of 2018, I put some focus on planetary imaging this year.  As always, I tried to be as frugal as possible with my choice of equipment and after a good deal of work I think I can stamp it as a success.  The image shows all these targets at the same scale for a decent comparison of how these appear in the sky. \r\n\r\nI learned a lot and even more about what NOT to do.   These were my first attempts planetary imaging with a Newtonian reflector.  The equipment used:  a TPO 12‚Äù Imaging Newtonian with a 5x Televue Powermate and ASI174MM-Cool.\r\n\r\nHappy New Year!!!",
