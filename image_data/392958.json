    "description": "This object is a nearby face-on barred spiral galaxy located 20 million miles away in the constellation of Virgo. It has a diameter of about 50,000 light-years.  This galaxy is unusual in that it has the diffuse look of a irregular dwarf galaxy and also a well defined spiral shape.\r\n\r\nReddish Ha regions and bluish stars are clearly visible, with a few Ha regions having a hint of a bubble shape.  The most interesting aspect of this image to me is the crisp bar at the center, 10,000 light years long.  This whitish core is sharply defined and has numerous small bright areas within, described in the Cambridge Atlas of Galaxies as \"HII regions arranged like pearls on a string along the entire bar\".\r\n\r\nNumerous tiny galaxies are visible in the background, including the thin galaxy ESO 576-26 at upper left.",
