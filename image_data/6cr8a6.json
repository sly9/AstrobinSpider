    "description": "What a strange looking nebula it is! Apart from the bow shock effect which gives its peculiar appearance, the use of a dynamic narrowband combination and a few hours of processing :-) of Ha-Oiii-Sii has brought a more dramatic and colorful view of this magnificent star breath!\r\n\r\nThis could all be due to the mechanics of a giant-dwarf star binary system which is not yet fully understood. All attempts to determine the orbital period having failed so far, raising doubts as to whether the nucleus of Abell 35 is a close binary at all.\r\n\r\nClick here to know more about <a href=\"https://thecoldestnights.com/2020/06/pixinsight-dynamic-narrowband-combinations-with-pixelmath/\">Dynamic narrowband combinations </a>",
