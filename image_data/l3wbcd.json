    "description": "A revised version of Saturn as observed on the September 20th 2020 using the wonderful telescope built by my friend Maximo Suarez. Sometimes re-processing is very useful; I was able to squeeze more details and a better color balance, not an easy task when mixing RGB and IR runs on a color camera. I am pretty happy with this final result.",
