    "description": "This is the last dance we saw in Lofoten Islands. We were coming from a night out seeing the northern lights, and we were not supposed to stop by this place. But as soon as we saw the clouds vanished for a moment, we quickly stopped and took the camera out. It took 5-10 minutes to get cloudy again. Nonetheless, we went to the hotel with the shot we wanted!!\r\n\r\nA7R III + Laowa 15mm f2\r\n\r\nwww.deviajeconmigo.com",
