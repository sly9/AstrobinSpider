    "description": "A single 900 frame stack of Jupiter and Callisto this morning, gentle processing. It will take me a while to crunch through the full set of over 50 avis so posting now as a preview. Taken in blue dawn sky when the planet was at its peak.\r\n\r\nI am hoping that derotation will improve signal to noise ratio a bit further. Blessed with a number of good seeing intervals today. Packed up the scope now as the forecast heralds rainy weather for the rest of this week.",
