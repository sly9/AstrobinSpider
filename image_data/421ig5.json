    "description": "Just recently captured some RGB star data to finally complete this image of IC410. I used many new PI processes to enhance the color and nebulosity while keeping the stars under control. I am really pleased with the overall color, contrast, and depth to the image. My goal was to get a deep, 3D feel to the image as if the \"tadpoles\" where swimming into the picture. \r\n\r\nIC410 resides in the nebula rich constellation of Auriga. So many winter gems in this area, I've spent 2 winter season imaging almost exclusively in this area. Maybe next year I will tackle Orion?\r\n\r\nIn the mean time...on to galaxy season!\r\n\r\nCS and be well,\r\nDan.",
