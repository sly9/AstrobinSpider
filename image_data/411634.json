    "description": "This object is a faint planetary nebula located 800 light years away in the southern constellation of Virgo.    The apparent size of the object is 8 arc-minutes long, which corresponds to an actual length of 2 light years.  The bright central star is clearly visible and has been determined to have a surface temperature over 10 times hotter than our sun.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the nebula is hard to interpret visually and is unlike any of the previous PN that I have imaged.  Detailed investigation by scientists still leaves some doubt as to the actual morphology.  It appears to be a oblong sphere which has been deformed in several locations by bipolar outflows.  \r\n\r\nThis is one of the few PN which has a stronger concentration of OIII than Ha in the outer shell region of the nebula.  In most PNs this is reversed, with Ha more strongly concentrated in the outer region.",
