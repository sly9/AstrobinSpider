    "description": "Here another testament of the powers of truly dark skies. Barely exceeding an hour worth of total exposure from the skies of southern Sardinia. Last exposures the last night at the camp-site before packing up family and everything and leaving for good. I had to wait to the wee hours as this magnificent galaxy won't rise till few hours before day-break in August. Even from southern Italy this deep sky object does not go very high up in the sky, being at declination -25deg, so you need to rush everything to try to get it as high as possible and at the same time watch out for the raising daylight coming along.",
