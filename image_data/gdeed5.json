    "description": "NGC 6334, also known as the Cat's Paw or Bear Claw Nebula, or Gum 64, is an emission nebula located in the constellation Scorpius, near the tip of the Scorpion' s tail. It got its name because it resembles a paw print in the heavens, with apparent dimensions of approximately 40 arcminutes. \r\n\r\nAt 5,500 light years distant, the Cat's Paw is an emission nebula with a red color (not shown in this SHO pseudo-color image) that originates from an abundance of ionized hydrogen atoms.",
