    "description": "I always wanted to shoot this group again and try and get the tidal tail of the NGC 3628.  Due to the light pollution at my location it has been real hard to pull it out. I had few clear nights that worked well but others had too much gradients to deal with.  All in all, I am happy how it turned out given it is a red zone location.",
