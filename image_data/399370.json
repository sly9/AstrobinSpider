    "description": "Once again processing some old data, this time M33 from October 2016. I actually have had this one posted to my website for a while but I was never happy with it, mainly the color. I decided to revisit it using a new technique i recently came across  for blending Ha data into galaxies. It turned out much better than the old method I used. Colors were pretty much exactly as they were in the raw RGB version. I also made a few other mistakes in my previous attempt like pushing Deconvolution a little too far. I ended up reprocessing the Lum data as well as HaRGB. I'm much more pleased with this version and hope you enjoy it too.",
