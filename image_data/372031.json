I was inspired by Terry Robison's excellent image of this object\r\n\r\nThis object is a planetary nebula. The strong blue colour is owed to the strong OIII emission - I would love to add some narrowband to the data at the next opportunity.\r\n\r\nBlurb on the imaging deails:\r\nLocation: Central Victorian Highlands, Victoria, Australia\r\nDates: 6 Oct - 11 Oct 2018\r\nOptics: AG Optical Systems 12.5\" iDK,\r\nFocal length 2121 mm\r\nCamera: mono FLI ML16200 with a Loadstar X2 on an Astrodon MOAG off-axis guider.\r\nAcquisition: Software: Sequence Generator Pro\r\nLRGB : 30 x 5min lum\r\n29 x 5min red\r\n19 x 5min green\r\n11 x 19min blue\r\n\r\ntotal integration 89 x 5min = 7 hours 25 mins\r\nAstrodon Gen II filters\r\nSensor temp: -30\r\nJet stream speed: 55km/hr\r\nCalm conditions",
