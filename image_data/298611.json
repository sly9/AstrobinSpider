    "description": "Not too many images of this object out there... actually I couldn't find any!\r\n\r\nSo here's a two panel HaRGB mosaic of Sharpless Sh2-12 & 13 (aka Gum 67 & 68, RCW 132) featuring M6 created with data all gathered one clear and very cold night in Kilmore, country Victoria, Australia. Moonset was at 1am so it was Ha before 1am and RGB afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt's an overlooked feint-ish target, but it's rich in Ha and has some pretty interesting Dark tower-like extrusions in Sh2-12 (the big one) and a Masterchef style Ha plate wipe in SH2-13 (the smaller one). \r\n\r\nVery happy to get the entire data set in a single clear night, despite mist lurking and fog threatening!\r\n\r\nHard to keep the motivation going to get up at 1:30am for the Meridian flip and again at 4am to finish the second panel of the mosaic with the temperature at a chilly 1degreeC. Brrrrr...\r\nAh - the joys of manual Ap with a mac  - No auto plate-solving or Meridian flips for this guy!\r\n\r\n2 Hrs Ha x 20min subs, 40mins ea RG&B x 5 min subs ea. per panel.\r\n\r\nI'm slowly getting better at processing HaRGB, but as always C&C are welcome :)\r\n\r\n",
