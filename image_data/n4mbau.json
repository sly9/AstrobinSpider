    "description": "This image shows a broad area of nebulosity near the star Sadr in Cygnus, part of IC 1318, the Butterfly nebula.  At the lower right is the open cluster M29.  Can you spot the planetary nebula Abell 69?  Starting from the center of the image, look for a tiny, red doughnut in the direction of 2 o'clock.  Sadr is just below the bottom left corner of the image.\r\n\r\nThis image is an HRGB composite, with H-alpha used for luminance.  All of the subs were collected in a single night, with less than 5 hours of darkness available at my location.  The transparency and seeing were really quite good, though.",
