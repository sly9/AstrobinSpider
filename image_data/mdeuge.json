    "description": "The Dark Shark Nebula is a molecular cloud in the Cepheus constellation. Within this field of view there are two reflection nebulae, along with tons of dust, all being illuminated by nearby stars. \r\n\r\nTo capture this nebula I used my Meade 115mm triplet apo and my ZWO ASI 071MC Pro under dark, moonless skies. This is a total of about 15 hours of data, captured over the course of four nights in June, 2020.\r\n\r\nTechnical information\r\n_______________________________________\r\nImaging Scope: 115mm Meade 6000 Triplet Apo\r\nImaging Camera: ZWO ASI071MC Pro\r\nGuiding Telescope: William Optics 50mm Guider\r\nGuiding Camera: ZWO ASI 120MC Mini\r\nMount: Skywatcher EQ-6R Pro\r\nFilters: Baader Uv/Ir Cut\r\nCapture Software: Sequence Generator Pro\r\nProcessing Software: Astro Pixel Processor, Pixinsight and Photoshop\r\n\r\nExposures:\r\n446 x 120s UV/IR Cut\r\ntotal of 14.8 hours",
