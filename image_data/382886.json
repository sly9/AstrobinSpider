    "description": "This object is located 6500 light years away in the constellation of Cassiopeia. This is an amazing complex, including emission nebulae, star clusters, dark nebulae, and fantastically eroded dust pillar towers.\r\n\r\nThere is a surprising amount of confusion in the literature for the designation of this beautiful area.  Even Astrobin has the incorrect designation shown on my image above.  This object is neither IC 1871 (which is a cluster off image to the left) or IC 1848 (which is a cluster off image to the right).  The best that I can determine, the bright nebula at right center is LBN 673.  The cluster to the left center is Collinder 34.  I cannot find the designation for the cluster near the right center edge of the image.\r\n\r\nI love how the clusters, centered in the bluish (oxygen) areas, are eroding and sculpting the massive dust clouds into a series of huge towering pillars.  All of these pillars are pointing back towards the clusters.  I also love the beautiful backlit glowing edges of these pillars.   Each pillar spans about 10 light years.  The stately pillar at lower right is amazing - a mountainous orangish pillar topped with a white majestic extension, like a lighthouse on a pillar of rock.\r\n\r\nThe dark silhouetted cloud shapes are also beautiful.  I especially like the dark spider-web-like netting of dark nebulae at upper left, and the intensely dark irregularly shaped small patch at center right.   I can't imagine how dense this latter cloud must be to block out all of the bright light behind it.\r\n\r\nThere are so many interesting things to see in this underappreciated small part of the sky.",
