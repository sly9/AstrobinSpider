    "description": "For two nights, Aug5 & 6,  I Comet C/2020 F3 NEOWISE was in the same field as globular clusters M 53 and NGC 5053.  And in fact, on the 6th, the comet covered NGC 5053 with its tail.  The above image is from that night using the RASA 8 and a ZWO 071mcP.\r\n\r\nMoon arose shortly after 10 p.m. where I could only salvage 17 x 180 second exposures.\r\n\r\nProcessed in PixInsight and still quite colorful. \r\n\r\nAnimations on my website:  https://thelonelyastronomer.com",
