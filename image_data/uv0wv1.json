    "description": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nonly a few degrees of the ever popular North America Nebula you will find this beautiful gem of a nebula. It is extremely large and barely fit into the new field with my Riccardi reducer. This is the first real image with my new gear which I purchased specifically to increase my potential of reaching faint signals. I'm now running at f/4.1 with 3nm filters. All worked out as I had planned and in addition I also increased my target goal to 24h per image which dramatically increased the image quality.\r\n\r\nI decided to also do a starless and a version with stars with exactly the same editing steps which should show a very interesting comparison I think.\r\n\r\nI hope you guys enjoy these two images.
