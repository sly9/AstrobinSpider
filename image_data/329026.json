    "description": "I'm fascinated by the Herbig-Haro objects glowing red in the dark dust of this object.  These look like fire seen through smoke and remind me of similar objects in M78.  After looking these up I learned they are cause by polar jets from young stars shocking nearby gasses.\r\n\r\nI found this difficult to process.  There is a lot of structure in the dark parts of the nebula and I wanted to retain it.  Part way through data capture I increased sub-exposure time from 10 to 15 minutes.  I ended up with 26 hours of data but still could not seem to control noise without losing the dark structures.  So here they are, a bit ugly but interesting!",
