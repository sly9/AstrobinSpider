    "description": "I can't believe I've never shot this galaxy before now. There are actually two halo's but I only got one of them. I tried short 3 minute exposures to keep as much of the core as I could, but it was still saturated there. I'll have to revisit this object again with something that has deeper well capacity on the camera, or just try even shorter exposures. Over all I'm reasonably happy with it.",
