    "description": "We pointed our telescope toward to Auriga to image a fairly low Nebula. February weather did unfortunately not allow us to get all the poses we were hoping and pretty average quality. The OIII signal is very weak on this Nebula, and the SII signal merges with the Ha signal.\r\nNot very satisfied by the result but we are not able to do better…. ☹\r\nIC417(also known as Sh2-234)  is identified in the southern central part of the constellation cocher, in a rich region of stars and nebulae.\r\nIt’s located almost 100 light-years across, located some 10,000 light-years away from. It is often referred to as the Spider Nebula .\r\nIC 417 is an emission nebula that is energized by embedded hot and a massive blue stars young cluster.\r\nThis cluster of about 80 stars are still embedded in glowing hydrogen gas. The bluish clouds of gas at the center of the image are locations of new star formation.\r\nThe two oppositely directed streams of material, in each side of the bowl structure indicate a very young star hidden in the thick soup, still madly gathering material around itself while its strong magnetic field ejected some of that stuff out at high velocity.",
