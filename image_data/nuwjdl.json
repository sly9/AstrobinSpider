    "description": "This is Orion's Belt with H-alpha signal added.\r\n\r\nThe three bright stars from left to right are Mintaka, Alnilam, and Alnitak. Mintaka is a double star whose stars orbit around each other every 6 days. Alnilam is a blue supergiant 375,000 times more luminous than our Sun. And Alnitak is a triple star system consisting of three extremely bright and hot blue stars. The largest of the triplet, Alnitak Aa, is 28 times more massive and has a diameter 20 times larger than our Sun.\r\n\r\nThe famous Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33) can be seen to the right of Alnitak. It's a dark nebula of dust in the middle of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. This cloud complex is a huge star forming region that encompasses all of the Orion constellation, including the Orion Nebula located in the middle of Orion's sword.\r\n\r\nProcess details:\r\nI combined about 7 hours of Ha data with 12 hours of RGB data in PixInsight. I then used StarNet++ to obtain a starless image and did a 50% blend with my RGBHa image in Photoshop. Final touches on color and HDR were adjusted in Photoshop.",
