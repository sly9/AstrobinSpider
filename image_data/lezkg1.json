    "description": "The North America Nebula has been studied by astronomers and imaged by astrophotographers for a long time. In 1786 astronomer William Herschel described a large emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus as a “faint milky nebulosity scattered over this space, in some places pretty bright.” Forty-three years later, in 1829, his son, John Herschel, listed it in their catalog. In 1890 astrophotographer Max Wolf recognized a familiar shape in his long-exposure photograph of the region and called it North America Nebula.\r\n\r\nI got lucky in September with five clear nights and excellent seeing. I was able to collect more than 35 hours of data. For this image I used only those sub lights with HFR ranging from 1.6-2.0, totaling about 24 hours of integration. With these excellent data I decided to experiment with different star processing approaches. The effort yielded six different version of the image. What I have posted today is my favorite. The processing approach of this version was a modified Tone Mapping process where starless, narrowband channels are married with a RGB/Master Luminance Masked image using the NBRGB script in Pixinsight. The resulting image has natural star color, fine detail, a soft, liquid-like transparency in the nebular clouds, and a glow that seems to emanate from inside.\r\n\r\nI will post all six approaches as a processing study on Astrobin in the near future.",
