    "description": "Another galaxy close up with a 5\" scope.  IC 342 appears a bit larger than some of the others, hence I was able to get a bit closer.  Palette is tricky with this galaxy.  This palette is pretty much what came out naturally--I did not make too many adjustments.  Overall I am pleased with the result, though a bunch more data would help to smooth out the darker regions of the disc.  For this image I used a super luminance composed with the Lum subs and all the RGB Subs",
