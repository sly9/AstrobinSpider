    "description": "Reworking this image for finer details less artefacts and better starcolors. This image is a HOB version of that stunning SNR in Taurus. The neccessary additional data, I captured last October in my backyard, the CDK data is of an Observatory I am member of. Especially the new blue data brought this pic a step forward in my eyes. Hope you like this color version.\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
