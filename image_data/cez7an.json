    "description": "I had excellent seeing for the transit of Ganymede and its shadow across the face of Jupiter.\r\nThe moon and shadow were integrated and processed separately. The detail on Ganymede corresponds well with the WinJUPOS graphic, which is based on a NASA image of the anti-Jovian Hemisphere, as you can see with the mouse over.\r\nThere is very good detail of the planet as well.",
