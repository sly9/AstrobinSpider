    "description": "Two panel Mosaic: 70 subs on the IC1369 panel and 59 on the Mu Ceph panel.  180 sec each sub. Taken on July 13, 14, 15.\r\n\r\nThis is a two panel mosaic covering only part of this very sizable and complex nebula.  This is a revisit with new data.  I did an early attempt at the Elephant Trunk just after starting my astrophoto hobby and I had hoped to do a better job this time.  I also wanted to expand the field of view to capture the Mu Cepheus.  I may come back to this to add other panels.  Though I collected a decent number of subs over two nights, persistent winds at my site caused me to ditch a good number and impacted things otherwise.  Also, I was struggling with about the worst of my tilt and backspacing issues at the time.  While I seemed to get decent detail in the nebulosities, many of the stars are out of whack!\r\n\r\nI have used GradientMergeMosaic on two other projects without much issue, but this time it gave me big problems.  Basically constant error messages about mismatch panel sizes, and when I worked my way around that it did a lousy job of stitching.  In fact, I needed no background extraction or gradient removal, as it ended up being unnecessary.  And I noticed that Star Alignment gave me what I needed since I had no gradients and the field was flat.  It did a fine job in the slight rotation needed to do the alignment.",
