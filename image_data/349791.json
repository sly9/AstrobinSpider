    "description": "After some changes at my 6 inch newtonian (secondary mirror heating removed, spider adjusted, collimation, added motor focus and replaced L filter with CLS filter), I captured luminance frames of M101 again to see if my adjustments made the desired improvements. I could aquire 52 L frames at the beginning of May, which turned to be significantly sharper than the frames I captured in February and March. \r\nThanks to Tommy Navratil's great explanations how to combine sharp and unsharp frames (by chance he also captured M101), I could combine all the frames I made this year into this new image.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is the maximum level of sharpness I can get out of my telescope. The only thing that not satisfies me is the color gradient in the two bright stars. I believe it is an artifact of the RGB data which I need to recapture sometime...",
