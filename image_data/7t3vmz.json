    "description": "The photo you see takes two large nebulae, the Ic 405 and the Ic 410 and a large open cluster M38, then there are other interesting celestial objects of minor importance, everything is placed in the constellation of the Auriga. The Ic 405 nebula has an interesting blue-violet area inside due to a mix of light that partly comes from the areas that have hydrogen ionized by the star AE Aurigae (the brightest star in the nebula) and partly comes from reflection of the blue light, always emitted by the star AE Aurigae, by the dust present there. \r\nThe photo was taken with HA OIII and RGB filters using the Canon 200mm F / 2.8 telephoto lens set to F / 4.0 using the Moravian g2 8300 ccd camera; as far as the blue-violet  zone is concerned, I used the Skywatcher ED 80 refractor.",
