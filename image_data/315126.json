    "description": "I have been wanting to shoot this target ever since I saw it in Astrobin. Unfortunately, the weather became cloudy/rain when i started it and it cleared with a large moon. I shot RGB last night in spite of the moon and it did result in a lot of tough gradients to work with.\r\n\r\nThe L is also not very good with bad guiding ( was shooting right before the front moved in).  If the sky clears without moon, i am hoping to atleast add 2x more L subs and reprocess this.\r\n\r\nShot at unity gain.\r\n\r\nProcessed in PI.",
