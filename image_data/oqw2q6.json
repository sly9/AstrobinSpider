    "description": "Monday's transit of Mercury in front of the Sun! That tiny black dot is our solar system's innermost planet! Such an event only happens about 13 times a century, but will not be visible again in North America for 30 years...\r\n\r\n Our family drove 9 hours to find a decent weather forecast, and we ended up at beautiful York River State Park, east of Williamsburg, VA. My 8 year old really struggled to spot the tiny dot, and only succeeded after a good deal of tears and at least 10 separate tries. In the end, he succeeded and was quite happy with the experience!",
