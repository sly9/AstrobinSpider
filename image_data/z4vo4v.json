    "description": "A single untracked shot of the pre-dawn Milky Way core rising in the East taken during a power outage.  A brief power outage allowed me to experience conditions close to a dark site from my home for a few minutes.  As luck would have it, I left the camera out all night shooting exposures for a time lapse.  While reviewing the shots, I found several during the power outage.\r\n\r\nTaken with a Nikon D750 and Sigma Art 35mm lens at f/1.4 and ISO 1600.  Shot from a static tripod.",
