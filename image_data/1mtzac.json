    "description": "This is my biggest ever project.\r\nA 15 panel mosaic of the North America nebula region shot with both my setups at the same time.\r\nI used my ASI294MC Pro with the AT106 to shoot Tri-band and Ha and my QHY183M on the TS65Q to shoot Ha and Oiii so the total integration time is 150 hours but the imaging time is half of that.\r\nBefore the mosaic I have the cameras swapped between the 2 scopes but I changed them over for a closer field of view and pixel scale between the 2.\r\nI started shooting the mosaic in April this year and I finished it last month.\r\nUsing APP, I extracted the Ha shot with the 294 and Ha filter and the Ha and Oiii shot with the tri-band. After that I stacked all the Ha and Oiii for each panel and blended them all in APP.\r\nI used pixinsight Starnet++ to remove the stars from both Ha and Oiii, I blended them into the HOO image and worked on it until I was ready to put the stars back.\r\nI'm really pleased with the result, it might not be perfect but I can say that it's my best astro image.\r\nI hope you like it too.\r\nEmil",
