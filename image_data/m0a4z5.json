    "description": "This image was taken as a test to my new camera, so the imaging strategy isn't optimized for obtaining the best quality. Half of the exposures were made with GFX-50R while the other half by 645z.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in direct comparison of the images from the two cameras, here you go:\r\nhttp://group.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/whwang/old/misc/M42_GFX_vs_645z.jpg\r\nThe images are processed in consistent ways to my taste.  645z (modified) is clearly less noisy (reasons unknown yet), but the H-alpha sensitivity of the unmodified 50R is very impressive.",
