    "description": "The Rosette Nebula (Caldwell 49 and NGC numbers 2237, 2238, 2239, 2244 & 2246) is a large H2 region a little over 5,000 light years away in the constellation of Monoceros.  The nebula is around 130 light years in diameter.\r\n\r\nThis framing of a portion of the nebula concentrates on the Bok globules, named after the Dutch-American astronomer Bart Bok, who in 1947 proposed that these dark nebula indicated clouds of dust undergoing gravitational collapse as part of the process of new star formation.  Infrared observations some 50 years later confirmed that this was indeed the case.    \r\n\r\nWe began the Rosette Nebula project on 13 February 2019 and finished photographing it on the same date in 2021.   \r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n \r\nTelescope: TEC 140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nSII: 24 x 1200s\r\nHa: 38 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 24 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 32 hours and 40 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Steve Milne",
