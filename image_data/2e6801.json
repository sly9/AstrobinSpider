    "description": "I was looking for another target around the Vela SN remnant with my reduced FL of 585mm. Not much by way of identification around here, something to one corner called Pismis4?\r\n\r\nThis area isnt the brighest part of the SN remnant, but looking at the NASA  skysurvey images it did look complex and interesting... and I'm pleased how much of that interest comes out here, first thought was like a red silken spider web coming apart, or capilliaries, veins and arteries... maybe I've been watching too much true crime on youtube, but it also looks horrifyingly a bit like the aftermath of a violent crime hence the title.\r\n\r\nThis is 7hours of the better (guding not great) 300s exposures I gathered over three partially cloudy nights only imaging this in the early evening. Ended up unintentionally with almost twice the Ha as OIII but seems to bring out the fine red filigree detail well. \r\n\r\nStacked, then HOO combined and pre-processed in APP with some selective colour adjustment then into PS for some selective mask work to bring out colour and detail a little more.",
