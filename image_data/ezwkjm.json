    "description": "This composite of my eclipse images came from the data I acquired near Vicuna Chile in July 2019.  The composite image is somewhat out of scale in that the images of the eclipse were individually taken with a 350mm WO71 and the post sunset background was taken with a 24-70 lens at 42mm.  The eclipse images were reduced in size but not enough to create the correct scale.  The placement is roughly where the eclipse path ran.  So let's just classify this as art and not science!\r\n\r\nAll images were taken with a Canon 5d Mk IV.\r\n\r\nHELP Please: Can anyone tell me how to get rid of the banding that shows up here on Astrobin?  It doesn't appear on the same laptop when viewed before uploading.  I check and I did edit this at 16bit in PS.",
