    "description": "This photo shows the beginning of the night in July 21st, 2017, in a farm located in the southeastern Brazil. It is possible to see a pillar of light stretching vertically from the horizon upwards and passes through a bright star in the top, which is actually the planet Jupiter. This pillar of light is called Zodiacal Light and it is formed by the scatering of sunlight on dust particles present in the Solar System, among the planets. Since the Solar Sistem is almost a plane, the particles are present in this same plane and the Zodiacal Light is seen as a thin pillar. A satellite caused a flare seen to the right of the Zodiacal Light. The photo was taken during the 10th Brazilian Astrophotography Meeting.",
