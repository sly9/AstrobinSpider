    "description": "Back when I first saw a starless version of a nebula I was completely blown away. It looked so different than anything I had ever seen and I said to myself that I would try again and again until I learned the processing skills to achieve a solid image. Well, this is my first try I'm willing to publish after many many many failed attempts with different techniques.\r\n\r\nI'm extremely happy with the result and it was well worth the learning experience. It is just stunning to me how different you can process an image.",
