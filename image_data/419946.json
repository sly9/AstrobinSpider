    "description": "I finally finished processing this 20-hour exposure of the Fireworks galaxy. I believe I spent more time processing than capture! This is quite an interesting target with NGC 6946 peering out of dusty Cepheus.\r\n\r\nThis is an LRGBHa image with Ha added in the R channel. There was no noise reduction done on this image, which is actually a first for me :) \r\n\r\nThanks for looking, questions/comments much appreciated.",
