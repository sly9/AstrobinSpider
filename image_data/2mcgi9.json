    "description": "Target:\r\nFighting Dragons of Ara (NGC6188).\r\nDistance to Earth: 4,000 light years.\r\n\r\nStar & Starless version added.\r\n\r\nNGC 6188, The Fighting Dragons of Ara, is an emission nebula in the constellation of Ara. It gets its name from the apparent silhouette of two dragons engaged in a cosmic combat. \r\nDue to its hydrogen-rich clouds, NGC 6188 is a region of active star formation, and its structure is shaped by the powerful stellar winds of the young and massive stars within. \r\nThe glowing bipolar planetary nebula, NGC 6164, is visible at the bottom of the frame, which some liken to being like the \"dragon's egg\".\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquisition:\r\n2 nights being 12th & 21st May 2021\r\nBortle Class 6 Sky in Victoria, Australia\r\nIntegration Time: 6 hours & 12 minutes \r\nLights: 20x360s 3nm Ha, 21x360s 3nm Oiii, 21x360s 3nm Sii, 3x60s R, 3x60s G, 3x60s B.\r\nCalibration: 80 darks, no flats, or bias.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of trial & error in processing this image, all of it fun. Thanks for looking :D\r\n\r\nFeel free to take a look through my other images on my site:\r\nhttps://onebreathtakinguniverse.com/\r\n\r\nClear skies.",
