    "description": "In the west of the Mare Serenitatis you can clearly see the mountain range of the Montes Apenninus, which is up to 5500m /18000ft high. It is the largest mountain range on the moon. Here is also the Rima Hadley, the landing area of Apollo 15. The landing took place on July 30th 1971 at 10:16:29 UTC. In the northern extension of Montes Apenninus is the smaller mountain range of the \"Montes Caucasus\".\r\n\r\nThe recording:\r\n3000 frames (poorly exposed)\r\n5% = 150 frames used\r\nFps: 39\r\nGain: 148\r\nExposure: 2.8 ms\r\nGamma: 34\r\nFilters: Baader IR Cut Moon & Skyglow\r\n\r\nThis shows once again that you cannot achieve really good results without care. At the end of my observations on this evening I simply made a quick-and-dirty shot with 3000 frames without paying attention to the exposure and the gain. (De facto without paying attention to anything :-)) Once again I was in a hurry because of  rising clouds, as “always” in our area. The Autostakkert! Quality Graph looked like this :-(.\r\nHowever, due to the fact that this part of the moon is so fascinating to me, I started this attempt to get a more or less acceptable picture.\r\n\r\nThis time I had to sharpen with Autostakkert! because I didn't get any good results here with Registax, for whatever reason.\r\nThank you astropical (https://www.astrobin.com/users/astropical/) for pointing out the sharpening function of Autostakkert!.\r\n\r\nThe rest including additional sharpening and denoising, I did very carefully with Lightroom.",
