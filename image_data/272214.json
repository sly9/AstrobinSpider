    "description": "If you’ve had the patience to wait for this image to load, then you’ll probably read this.   \r\n\r\nIt is with great sadness that I must announce: a space telescope is currently out of my budgetary reach.   Undaunted, I still managed to find a way to make it look like I could afford it.  \r\n\r\nMy apologies for the loading time (~100mb file).  GIF was reduced to 50% resolution and only 64 shades of gray just to make it somewhat reasonable.   Please excuse the loss of some fidelity (especially highlights).   I’ve been slowly working on a different compilation in an actual video format.  \r\n\r\nOriginal image…\r\n<a href=\"http://astrob.in/264892/0/\"><img src=\"http://astrob.in/264892/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg\"/></a>\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:   \r\nBy popular demand, here is my workflow.   With anything AP related, the devil is in the details.   So, there is quite a bit more to it, but at a basic level...\r\n\r\n1. Take a full disk (or as close as you can come) image of a solar system object\r\n2.  Generate a 2D surface map in WinJupos\r\n3.  Use that map as a surface texture on a 3D sphere in Photoshop.  \r\n4.  Use a timeline to animate the camera motion.   \r\n5.  Render (wait 3 days, ughhhh).  \r\n\r\nOn my long to-do list is to actually create a walk through of the process.  ",
