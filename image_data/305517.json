    "description": "Situated not too far from the more famous Iris Nebula, the Ghost Nebula is a notably similar tangled structure of backlit dark dust.   The name comes from the obvious appearance of two figures to the lower left.   The nebula is classified as a globule, meaning it is a relatively isolated patch of dark dusty material.  \r\n\r\nI would be remiss in not mentioning this one took me a LONG time to get where I wanted it.   Capture was one aspect, but processing this dark nebula out of Orange Zone data was truly a challenge.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
