    "description": "The outer area of NGC6543 is very faint and the core extremely bright.\r\nIt was my longest exposure so far, and the conditions were very different.\r\nThe image processing was a challenge.\r\nMaybe I will add some exposure time .\r\n\r\n\r\nObject description (wikipedia.org): \r\n\r\nThe Cat's Eye Nebula or NGC 6543, is a relatively bright planetary nebula in the northern constellation of Draco, discovered by William Herschel on February 15, 1786. It was the first planetary nebula whose spectrum was investigated by the English amateur astronomer William Huggins, demonstrating that planetary nebulae were gaseous and not stellar in nature. Structurally, the object has had high-resolution images by the Hubble Space Telescope revealing knots, jets, bubbles and complex arcs, being illuminated by the central hot planetary nebula nucleus (PNN). It is a well-studied object that has been observed from radio to X-ray wavelengths.",
