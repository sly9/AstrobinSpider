    "description": "* Acquisition: iTelescope-Portugal.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n\r\nA group of friends of whom I am a member decided to make some photographs of the Southern Hemisphere. As we reside in the Northern Hemisphere, we used a remote telescope in Australia to make the images.\r\n\r\nWe made this object with a 16\" telescope and then tried the 17\" telescope. The difference in definition is very expressive.\r\n\r\nIn full resolution we can observe the detail of the hydrogen that extends through the nebula and also numerous stellar clusters, including the core, known as R136, filled with some of the most massive stars found in our neighborhood, weighing more than 100 times the mass of our Sun.\r\n\r\nAlso known as 30 Doradus or NGC 2070, the Tarantula Nebula, so called because it resembles a web, is a HII region (red/pink shows hydrogen) about 1,000 light-years in length, located in the Great Magellanic Cloud , a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, at an estimated distance of 170,000 light-years from Earth.\r\n\r\nDespite the splendor of this image, we are facing an extremely hostile place for life. Here the stars form, evolve, and end their lives rapidly, often violently. The photograph contains stars at different stages of its evolution, some newly formed (about 2 million years old), still hidden in dense, dark gas bubbles, as well as the remnant of giants that ended their cycle in supernova explosions.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that NGC 2070 is only 2 million years old and consists of more than 500,000 stars. Its core is filled with some of the most massive and young stars, warm stars carve the walls of gas with ultraviolet radiation, creating similar structures To pillars, valleys and ridges, as well as shock waves that will compress the surrounding material and, by the action of gravity, end up giving rise to new stars.\r\n\r\nSee also the same object but taken with the 16\" Astro Systeme Austria (Telescope 33):\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/337754/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/337754/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>    <a href=\"https://astrob.in/317998/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/317998/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>    <a href=\"https://astrob.in/317990/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/317990/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>    <a href=\"https://astrob.in/317991/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/317991/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
