    "description": "Exoplanet – it's non solar system planet. Currently there are over 4000 discovered exoplanets and this number is constantly going up. As you can see in the image below, I managed to capture transits of 3 exoplanets.\r\n\r\nWhat does exoplanet transit mean and how it's possible to capture them?\r\n\r\nExoplanet transit- it's event when from out point of view planet moves in front of it's home star and thus reducing the amount of light emitted by it. Check out the visualization - when planet is still not in front of it's home star, we can see that star is emitting it's usual amount of light, but when exoplanet starts it's transit, the amount of light begins to drop until whole disc of the planet is in front of the star and stays steadily lower until the end. If we were to capture light drop-off of only this one star, it would be difficult to discern whether it was a transit or just atmospheric turbulence or noise in camera sensor. Thus we need to compare the light amount emitted by this star to surounding stars of similar brightness, because they are also affected by turbulences and variation in camera noise. We can compare ratio between those stars and the star where transit is happening and see how that ratio shifts, which probably means that transit is happening. As I was capturing transits of already known exoplanets, it was not hard to find when it will happen and easily prepare for it.\r\n\r\nAll of my captured exoplanets are called hot Jupiters. It's Jupiter sized or larger planets that orbit very close to their star . Imagine it: planet that is almost 3 times larger than Jupiter but it orbit's in under a day! Our own planet that is much smaller takes 365 days to do that.\r\n\r\nRegarding missing gap in KELT-16 b's measurements- I had some gear hiccups, this was one of the first images done with new camera, so had an hour of lost data, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nSome more info about the captured exoplanets themselves\r\n\r\nKelt-16 b \r\nMeasurements- https://api.arturas.space/Images/KELT-16b.png\r\nImage- https://api.arturas.space/Images/Kelt16b.png\r\nPeriod – 0.97 day \r\nMass – 2.75 Jupiter \r\nSize – 1.4 Jupiter \r\nTransit duration – 2.5h\r\n\r\nHAT-P-49 b \r\nMeasurements- https://api.arturas.space/Images/HAT-P-49b.png\r\nImage- https://api.arturas.space/Images/HAT_P_49b.png\r\nPeriod – 2.69 day\r\nMass – 1.73 Jupiter \r\nSize – 1.41 Jupiter \r\nTransit duration – 4h\r\n\r\nQatar-3 b \r\nMeasurements- https://api.arturas.space/Images/Qatar-3b.png\r\nImage- https://api.arturas.space/Images/Qatar_3b.png\r\nPeriod – 2.5 day \r\nMass – 4.31 Jupiter \r\nSize – 1.07 Jupiter \r\nTransit duration – 4h",
