    "description": "Here’s another one of my “animals” from the high-declination regions of the milky way: not fish this time, but a reptile. This Gecko sits, very appropriately, in the constellation Lacerta (Latin for “lizard”). It’s a faint wisp of molecular cloud, 6 hours of integration at f/5.6 under good Bortle 3 sky were barely sufficient to produce a readable image.",
