    "description": "Abell 34 (PNG 248.7+29.5, PK248+29.1) is a large but faint planetary nebula located approximately 2,400 light-years away in Hydra. \r\n\r\nThe bright area on the bottom of the very circular image of Abell34 is a very tiny galaxy PGC3081651.  You can just make out its central core and the spiral wings.  The RGB image shows not the slightest hint of its existence. What we see of it on the Oiii/Ha enhanced image comes entirely from the Oiii and Ha signals.\r\n\r\nAbell 34 is fairly large for a planetary nebula at 4.8 arc-minutes in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe Oiii signal is many times stronger than the Ha.  The Oiii shows up only very faintly on the RGB image.  The central progenitor star of the PN is clearly visible in the center as a very small blue star.",
