    "description": "A day is 24 hours on Earth.\r\nA day (sol) is just 37 minutes longer on Mars.\r\nYou can imagine these two neighboring planets are spinning slightly off sync. \r\nTo see the full face of Mars, it would take about a month on Earth from a given location.\r\nThe figure here shows the rotation of Mars in 15 degree increments. \r\nI was lucky to get most of the images in about 2.5 months during the Mars 2020 opposition to create this figure.",
