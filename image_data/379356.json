    "description": "I really liked the color treatment Alan Pham did to his image revision, so I tried my version of this wonderful target. I think the colors came out just the way I wanted, 30 hours of integration time certainly helped. Unfortunately star colors are u really blank, because of the tonemapping technique i did to the different channels, anyways since this is false color it doesn't really matter.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it, critics are welcomed!",
