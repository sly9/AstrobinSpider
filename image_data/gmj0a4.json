    "description": "SH2-129 is a larger emission nebula complex in Cepheus that is dominated by H-alpha emissions. Ha makes the red background of this image. In 2011 a very faint OIII emission nebula structure was found by Nicolas Outters. OU4 is resembles to a squid which lead to the name of the nebula.\r\n\r\nThe image is a combination of image data shot with my 80/480 mm refractor with 0.79 x reducer for the field (=380 mm). The Squid data come from the 130/910 mm refractor which I originally had used to image only OU4.\r\n\r\nCamera: ASI1600mmp,  \r\n\r\n80 x 200s Ha (480 mm)\r\n63 x 300s OIII (910 mm)\r\n30 x 30s red, green, blue (480 mm)",
