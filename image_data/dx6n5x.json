    "description": "Two panel mosaic using Tak FSQ106N, Atik 11000 and Mesu 200 in L HaRGB. The idea was to try and catch as much of the outer glow as possible so I went for 30 minute luminance subs, which certainly helped. I also used some short TEC140 subs to try to reach into the core in luminance. In this reprocess of older data I used Starnet++ which wasn't available at the time and has helped with star reduction. I also followed the Hubble team on colour, cooling my original reds, lessening the intensity of the blues and generally going for lower saturation.",
