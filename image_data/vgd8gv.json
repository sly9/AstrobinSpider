    "description": "Here is our third image, we are not really satisfied because the layers Ha and OIII that we acquired are not strong enough to be integrated and it lacks precision, nevertheless we still decide to present it to you\r\n\r\nNGC 6744 : Beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 6744 about  is nearly 175,000 light-years across, larger than our own Milky Way. It lies some 30 million light-years distant in the southern constellation Pavo and appears as only a faint, extended object in small telescopes. We see the disk of the nearby island universe tilted towards our line of sight. This galaxy portrait covers an area about the angular size of the full moon. In it, the giant galaxy's elongated yellowish core is dominated by the light from old, cool stars. Beyond the core, grand spiral arms are filled with young blue star clusters and speckled with pinkish star forming regions. An extended arm sweeps past a smaller satellite galaxy at the upper left. NGC 6744's galactic companion is reminiscent of the Milky Way's satellite galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud.\r\nWe can also see 2 pairs of galaxies interacting; IC 4820 at the top of the image and IC 4823 at the bottom left of the galaxy. Other small ones are spotted in the field, ESO 104.38, ESO 104-42, ESO 104-42, LEDA 327024",
