    "description": "Celestial Dance  - March 2018\r\n\r\nThis scene was pure magic and was worth the effort of staying up all night, freezing our fingers to the bone, and spending 4 hours in the car. This breath-taking celestial drama unfolds every night as we sleep peacefully in our beds. The wonders of the Universe never cease to amaze me!\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way Galaxy photographed at 4:30 am from a secluded dark location 2 hours west of Ottawa in Ardoch, Ontario, 150 kilometers away. Ottawa's light dome glows brightly in the distance straight ahead while the city of Kingston's light dome shines a brilliant white in the lower right of the frame. The bare winter trees stand in silent witness silhouetted against the flaming sky. \r\n\r\nTechnical info\r\nCamera: Nikon D5500\r\nLens: Sigma 24-35/f2 Art\r\nTripod head: Sirui L-20S Pan/Tilt Head\r\nAperture F2\r\nExposure: 6 seconds x 28 images\r\nISO 3200\r\nFocal length 24mm\r\nShooting order:  4 rows, 7 frames/row. I began shooting at the top row left side and work left to right then down to horizon row.\r\nThe 28 images were stitched together with Microsoft ICE \r\nFinal processing of stitched image done in Photoshop CS5",
