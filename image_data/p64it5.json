    "description": "I had another go at this interesting nebula, but this time using the Triad Ultra Quad filter.  You can compare to my image, NGC7830 OSC, using the LeXtreme filter, but much less integration time with the Triad which probably explains why less of the fringe nebula dust.  My processing has gotten better so its not a totally fair comparison.  I see improvement with the Triad in color and star color, but not sure it is worth the cost over $1k from OPT.  When I first opened the box, the filter was well packed, but was extremely dusty...more dusty than any of my filters even after weeks of use.  I'm usually a good citizen and wouldn't return unless really unsatisfied, but I will be sending this back for a refund.",
