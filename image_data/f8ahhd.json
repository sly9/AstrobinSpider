    "description": "==========================================================================\r\n**Edit / Revision**\r\n\r\nBack at home and on my imaging laptop, I have an opportunity to process these captures properly.\r\n\r\nWith more control over the colour balance it is possible to see hints of red in the Rev D image, which is caused by excitation of oxygen at higher altitudes where it is less dense.\r\n==========================================================================\r\n\r\nComing only slightly delayed from Inari in Finland!\r\n\r\nWe got really lucky our first night here, as clouds and snow are forecast for the rest of the week.\r\n\r\nI don't have my image processing laptop with me, so I'll come back to the captures later for proper processing (tranferring the image to my mobile phone causes some ugly compression artefacts). Should be able to make a decent animation, too. \r\n\r\nBut I'm excited to share one of the best shots, as this is my first time seeing and imaging the northern lights ... with a reasonably well-known asterism in the frame as well.  ;)\r\n\r\nCapturing the images was borderline painful, as I had to rush to set up in -19 deg C temperatures. Ended up remote controlling my camera using my mobile phone (fastest and surest way to control long exposures on my Olympus) but didn't have my stylus handy to operate the touch screen.\r\n\r\nInitially I was taking my gloves off alternating hands to trigger each exposure, but that soon became unbearable ... so I ended up keeping both gloves on and using the (increasingly numb) tip of my nose to push the \"button\" on my mobile phone's screen.\r\n\r\nAll worth it in the end, thank you mother nature for a great show!  :)",
