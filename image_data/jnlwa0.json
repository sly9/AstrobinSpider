    "description": "Here is my version of the Soul nebula processed and combined in the Hubble Palette.  I managed to capture some good H-alpha data in december and some decent OIII and SII data in January/February. All data was captured from my backyard, processed with Pixinsight and Photoshop.\r\n\r\nRevision: Rework of sharpening and carefully working on small details, big thanks to <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/mxcoppell/\">Min Xie</a> for some super helpful tips on replacing RGB with narrowband stars :-)",
