    "description": "This is the first time i pushed my new telescope, newton Gso 10\" (f/3.8 with the flattener), into a multi sessions project. \r\nFrom my Bortle 9 city backyard (only the South is visible because of buildings), i can't shoot for more than 3 hours per night, so these almost 17 hours over 1 month it's a good result for my standard (considering the usable nights because of the Moon, bad weather and so on).\r\n\r\nIt's not wrong to say that one of the reasons that pushed me to buy this new 10\" telescope f/3.8, was to try the new technique of many short frames. I choosed 15 seconds for this new project, thinking that it was a good balance between the light pollution and trying to go as deep as it was possible with this very low 400 Iso of my 1200D full spectrum (usually i choose 1600 Iso but it's really noisy at that). \r\n\r\nWhy did i frame M31 like this? Because in the past i already took pictures of Andromeda with different setup (80/480 - 65/420 and so on), but this time i wanted so badly to have a lots of subs of the central zone! \r\nI didn't want to \"waste\" nights for a mosaic - as said, i already shot the whole subject with different focal lenghts. \r\n\r\nI wished so much the heart of Andromeda... so i went for it!\r\n\r\nThis is the story behind this project, hope you like the image.",
