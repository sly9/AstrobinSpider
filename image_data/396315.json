    "description": "Taken during the astrophotography trip to Coonabarabran on Mar-19. Not lucky enough to have decent weather and enough data, got attacked by clouds and rain over the trip. Half of the subs were discarded.  This is one of the shot taken on the last night of the trip. It looks like a face of a barking dog, anyone found out the same?",
