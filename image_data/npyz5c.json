    "description": "I have an affinity with Dark Nebulae. I think they're the gems of astrophotography. Tough to master. Impossible to capture in the city (to do them justice). And just incredibly cool to look at. These Nebulae in my opinion are some of the best to capture at a dark site. This one is VDB141 aka The Ghost. It's located just around the corner from the very popular Iris Nebula. I used the explorescientific ED127 at 952mm FL and the qhyccd 294M-Pro monochrome camera. This is only 4 hours of data. I barely had ANY color data at all because the night was short lived but the equipment stood up to the task. I'm incredibly excited to have a result like this. I'm considering another trip up this week.",
