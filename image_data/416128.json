    "description": "This one was one of the toughest objects for me to process. Even with almost 30 hours of OIII and 30 hours of Ha, it was so so faint. \r\n\r\nSh2-174 is an unusual ancient planetary nebula. Usually the white dwarf can be found very near the center of the planetary nebula. But in the case of Sh2-174 it off to the right. (It is the very blue star near the center of the blue gas). This asymmetry is due to the planetary nebula's interaction with the interstellar medium that surrounds it.",
