    "description": "This is a picture of IC 10 taken already 2 years ago. This is one of the disappeard pictures of the data crash in the springtime. I slightly changed the picture, but the background is too dark and the color setting is still not optimal. Once I have to redo it completely:-((\r\nDuring recording the air was very stable, which gave a good resolution!\r\n \r\nThe galaxy is in a distance of 22.000 Lj and has a visual size of 6,4 x 5,3 arcmin.  The galaxy is relativly weak with a surface of 14m9. This is the only starburst galaxy of our local group.",
