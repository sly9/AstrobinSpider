    "description": "I started imaging this object a bit late in the season, so was only able to get a few hours on it each night. This took nine sessions to complete across two months. In processing this, I was pleased to see that the bow shock from the black hole candidate Cygnus X-1 was visible in my image, seen here just to the right and bottom of the tulip. I have not colorized the bow shock in any way to make it stand out.",
