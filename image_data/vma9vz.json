    "description": "About 1,500 light years away in the constellation Auriga is the bright nebula, The Flaming Star (IC 405). The glowing blue region at the center of this image is created by the light from a massive, blue dwarf star, AE Auriga, reflecting off of the surrounding dust. AE Auriga was not formed in this location. It is a “runaway star” that was ejected two million years ago from the area of the Trapezium Cluster (Orion’s Sword) in a collision of two binary stars.\r\n\r\nThis image is another experiment combining data acquired in different years with different telescopes. The 2018 data were taken with an SW Esprit 100 (550mm) and the 2019 data with a WO FLT132 (925mm), both using the same ZWO ASI1600M Pro camera. In this rendition the 2018 data (FOV 1.84 X 1.39 degrees) were used for color mapping, while the 2019 data (FOV 1.09 X 0.83 degrees) were used only in a luminance mask. To help enhance the resolution of the nebular structure the 2019 data were edited to include only sub lights whose HFR < 2.7, reducing the data set from 20.1 hours to 9.2 hours.",
