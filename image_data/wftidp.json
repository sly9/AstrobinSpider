    "description": "NGC 1999 is a small bright reflection Nebula (the central small blue object) often called the Key Hole due to the shape of the empty patch in the center. Astronomers are still researching how a complete void came about in the middle of the nebula.\r\nNGC 1999 is surrounded by large clouds of ionized Hydrogen gas as well as regions of Oxygen III.\r\nImaged on our Officina Stellare RiDK 400 in LRGB at Obstech, Chile.\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby \r\nSystem control Software: Voyager by Leonardo Orazi\r\nRiDK 400 Team:  Mike Selby, Leo Orazi, John Kasianowicz, Rick Stevenson, Josh Balsam and Scott Johnson",
