    "description": "Late morning on Clavius - Third largest crater on the visible side of the moon. Named for the Jesuit priest and 16th century German mathematician/astronomer. The craterlet pattern on the 3.5-km-deep floor of Clavius is amazing.\r\n\r\nDue to its large size (225 km wide), Clavius is easily seen with the naked eye as a notch in the terminator 1-2 days after the moon reaches first quarter. One of the oldest craters on the moon at around 4 billion years. The curving chain of diminishing craters which run anticlockwise from the southern edge of the crater across the crater floor (Rutherfurd - Clavius D - Clavius C - Clavius N, Clavius J - Clavius JA) are a useful tool for amateur astronomers wanting to test the resolution of their smaller telescopes. Luckily, I can see numerous craterlets smaller than the 7-km-wide Clavius JA crater at the end of the chain. I have imaged around 48 craters and craterlets across the floor of Clavius, with my resolution limited to around a kilometre I believe. Imaging details listed on the processed image.",
