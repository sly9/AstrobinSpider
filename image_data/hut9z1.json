    "description": "Well AstroBin friends...we've all been there.  This one fought me every step of the way.  \r\n\r\nDoing broadband from my backyard is always a challenge.  The light pollution from the city makes it really tough to produce a great image.  And to just make things more fun, I ended up with dust on my L filter that I just could not get to flat out.  So between fixing the dust donuts and trying to get the background to look somewhat respectable, I put quite a bit of time into the post-processing of this image... Likely, too much as I may have ended up ultimately making things worse, but it's time to call it.  This image has REALLY made me appreciate the dark skies I get at Deep Sky West even more.\r\n\r\nHowever, I just fell in love with the composition and field of view, so I had to post it!  With my SCT I was focused right in on M106, so I never even knew there were so many other galaxies in the neighborhood.  It was fun to do a little bit wider view of this beautiful object and get all of its pals.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it as well.  Please be kind...I know it's not a show stopper... ðŸ˜‚",
