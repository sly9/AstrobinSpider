    "description": "We have very, very bad weather in all three months. So I gather even a single exposure with after assembly, then the clouds rolled in. This Cone nebula project, is and experiment too. I curious about the 6D performance. Well. Not bad. Almost 2 times faster than the APS-C 1100D. I Like it! \r\n\r\nBut the 6D comes four times more cloudly days, so this was a strange decision. :-)",
