    "description": "California Nebula in HaRGB - Starless version\r\n-------------------------\r\nThis is the starless version of the image I was able to capture back in November/December 2019.\r\nIt is the result of 12 hours of combined Ha + RGB colour data on this enormous emission nebula, which is located ~1500 light years away from us.\r\nIt was produced using the Starnet++ software.\r\n\r\nThe original image can be found here:\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/60r91f/E/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/60r91f/E/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>\r\n\r\nThe Ha-only version of it can be found here:\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/v4shpy/B/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/v4shpy/B/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>\r\n\r\nI don't usually do starless images, but sometimes they can be very impressive and show a clearer definition of the details of the nebulosity.\r\n-------------------------\r\nTotal imaging time: 12 hours (90x300\" in H-alpha + 90x180\" in colour)\r\nTelescope: Sky-Watcher Evostar ED80 Black Diamond\r\nCamera: ZWO ASI294MC Pro\r\nMount: Celestron AVX",
