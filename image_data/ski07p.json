    "description": "Abell 1185 is a galaxy cluster visible through the southwest edge of Ursa Major.  The cluster contains at least 82 galaxies at a distance of about 400 million light-years from Earth.  The most prominent galaxies in this image are elliptical galaxies, but many spiral, lenticular, and irregular galaxies are also seen.  The blue structure at lower right is part of Abell 1185 and is also listed in Halton Arp’s Catalog of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 105.  This structure is reported to be formed from the collision of a spiral (NGC 3561A) and an elliptical (NGC 3561B) galaxy.  This merger apparently created star–forming tidal dwarf galaxies at the ends of the tidal tails emanating from the spiral.  Arp 105 is often called “The Guitar” as it appears to have been designed by guitar innovator Leo Fender (who remarkably never learned to play the guitar).  The Hubble Space Telescope confirmed the presence within Abell 1185 of many globular star clusters that are not gravitationally bound to any individual galaxy.  These star clusters are known to be roaming around Abell 1185 in search of the concert that Fender will never play.\r\n\r\nLinks to online references used in this narrative:\r\n\r\n<a href=”APOD: 2005 November 22 - A Galactic Collision in Cluster Abell 1185 (nasa.gov) “ target= _new>APOD: 2005 November 22 - A Galactic Collision in Cluster Abell 1185 (nasa.gov) </a>\r\n<a href=”The Lumpy Cluster Abell 1185 - NASA/ADS (harvard.edu) “ target= _new>The Lumpy Cluster Abell 1185 - NASA/ADS (harvard.edu) </a>\r\n<a href=”Abell 1185 | British Astronomical Association (britastro.org) “ target= _new>Abell 1185 | British Astronomical Association (britastro.org) </a>\r\n<a href=”The globular cluster systems of Abell 1185 - NASA/ADS (harvard.edu) “ target= _new>The globular cluster systems of Abell 1185 - NASA/ADS (harvard.edu) </a>\r\n<a href=”https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2011/04/aa15939-10.pdf“ target= _new>https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2011/04/aa15939-10.pdf </a>\r\n<a href=”ARP Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies (caltech.edu) “ target= _new>ARP Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies (caltech.edu) </a>\r\n<a href=”901063.pdf;sequence=1 (herts.ac.uk)“ target= _new>901063.pdf;sequence=1 (herts.ac.uk) </a>",
