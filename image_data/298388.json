    "description": "This is a HaRGB image that I processed from data from the Liverpool Telescope with a cryptic name on the subs \"bd65_1637\", so I had no idea what it was during processing. The coordinates are 21 42 50, +66 06 46. \r\n\r\nPlate solving by Astrobin solved the mystery:  it is NGC 7129\r\n\r\nNGC 7129 is a reflection nebula located 3,300 light years away in the constellation Cepheus. A young open cluster is responsible for illuminating the surrounding nebula. A recent survey indicates the cluster contains more than 130 stars less than 1 million years old [all according to Wikipedia] \r\n\r\nFliters and Exposures used:\r\nsdss- r 15 x 90 s\r\nHa 9 x 120 s (stacked 40:60 with sdss-r for red channel)\r\nBessell B  14 x 90 s (blue channel)\r\nBessell V  13 x 90 s (green channel)",
