    "description": "Sh 1-89 is a small bipolar planetary nebula in Cygnus approximately 6,400 light years away. It was originally included on the Sharpless catalog of emission nebulae but it was left off the revised Sharpless 2 catalog since it was found to be a planetary nebula. Thus, it’s one of only two ‘Sh1 but not Sh2’ objects (along with Sh1-118 in Cassiopeia). This target is faint and small, but it’s not incredibly faint or small - along with the fact that it’s got a lot of interesting structure, I’m surprised it isn’t a more popular target.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I'm really happy with how this one came out (especially considering the camera troubles I was having early on when imaging this). Special thanks to Jeremy Sheere and Keith Hanssen for constructive criticism on this one.",
