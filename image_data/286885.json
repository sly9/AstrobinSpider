    "description": "M51 taken from my backyard near Denver, Colorado. \r\n\r\nI ended up using about 24 hours of data, which was only half of what I originally took. \r\n\r\nEven though I collect a lot of frames, much of it is sub-par due to seeing and the occasional high clouds blocking the target but also reflecting light pollution.\r\n\r\nI was hurt by having less Ha and Luminance data to stand against a larger amount of R,G & B data, so I had to get a little creative when it came time to combining color channels - without introducing noise from the lesser-time channels.. The Ha ended up just getting mixed in with R. The Luminance was mixed with extracted lightness from the RGB to quiet it down a bit more, then blended back after an attempt at deconvolution.\r\n\r\nI'm still fighting my subtle ICX814-related background \"tiger stripes\", but mostly controlled them through PixelMath.",
