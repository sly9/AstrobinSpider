    "description": "HFG1 (PK 136+05) is a very old large, low-surface-brightness planetary nebula in Cassiopeia that was discovered by Heckathorn, Fesen, and Gull in 1982. It surrounds, and was produced by, a binary star system (V664 Cas) that is moving rapidly through our Galaxy. The star is moving towards the lower left of the image. As HFG1 plows through the interstellar medium, a bluish bowshock is produced; and a red trail of gas is left behind in its wake.\r\n\r\nRef: Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 396(2):1186 - 1188 Â· June 2009",
