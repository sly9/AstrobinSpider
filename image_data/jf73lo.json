    "description": "While waiting to finish my backyard project of M106 (2 weeks of rain here), I shot another must-do Southern Nebula, the Dragons of Ara. It is a nebula situated at 4000 ly and is a star forming region. The Dragon shape is absolutely impossible to miss, I think you can probably observe it without knowing the name the first time you look at it. \r\n\r\nThis time I drizzled the image, yes a Chilescope drizzle ! , but since I followed the rule of undersampling I was just below 2 pixels with the FWHMEccentricity measurement. Visually there were some small squared stars, so the math confirmed it. The full is pretty big. The problem with a drizzle master is that the processing in Pixinsight is much longer, each step requires more computing power.",
