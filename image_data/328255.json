    "description": "I find the OIII rich nebulae to be the most interesting thing here.  I wonder how many other galaxies would benefit by OIII data?\r\n\r\nThis image is an odd amalgamation of data from the 2016 and 2017 seasons.  In 2016 I had shot quite a bit of LRGB binned 2x2 and unguided due to some guide camera issues.  I added more bin 1x1 guided RGB data in November.  All of the LRGB data is 300 seconds.  I then started shooting Ha.  Since I thought of the Ha only enhancing red color data I shot that bin 2x2 at 900 seconds.  Seeing so much nebula structure I thought some OIII could help  and added OIII 2x2 at 900 seconds.  (see my other narrowband only post on this)\r\n\r\nI now have 260 LRGB subs and 105 Narrowband subs with a total integration time of 46 hours.  Non of the Luminance is 1x1 binned!  So I guess next year I work on that....\r\n\r\nThe brightest nebulae are on the edge of saturated in Ha.  I guess that's for next year too.\r\n\r\nThe Ha and OIII were added as layers in PS with a lighten blending.  Ha was colored Magenta and OIII blue.",
