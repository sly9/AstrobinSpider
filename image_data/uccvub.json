    "description": "Lately, I have been processing the many images I acquired of Comet NEOWISE back in July and this image taken on July 14th showed the bow shock the best. When the comet's nucleus gets heated by the Sun, it creates an atmosphere around it called the coma as seen in the image. The bow shocks are the result of the interaction of the solar wind and this coma atmosphere. Comet NEOWISE had several bow shocks.",
