    "description": "This  beautiful Nebula I had in my list for quite a time. While imaging and processing I found the stunning structure right of the pillar more interesting than the pillar itself which of course is the eyecatcher of this image. Like always OIII was the most difficult under my suburban sky. So I decided to try something new this time. I added a good amount of Cls fitered frames in the OIII stack, which worked quite well. Overall I found interesting how many colors appear in that object, when you find the balancing point. I am quite happy with the result and hope you like it too....\r\nCS, Christoph",
