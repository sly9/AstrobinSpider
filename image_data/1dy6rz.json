    "description": "This cloud of dust and gas is part of the Veil Nebula, a supernova remnant of a massive star that exploded 8000 years ago (NASA site). It is situated in Cygnus, at around 2100 ly away. The Pickering Triangle doesn't actually have a NGC number and it wasn't discovered by Pickering, but by Williamina Fleming in 1904. Credit went to EC Pickering the director of the Harvard College Observatory (Wikipedia). Reading about the discovery I found out that W. Fleming first worked as Pickering's maid, before working at the Observatory. She also discovered the Head Horse Nebula. \r\n\r\nI really like this part of the Veil since it captures so well  the end of the star, with its delicate filaments that start to fade deep into the Cosmos. It is the first time when I adventure into HOO territory. I think it is much more adapted than a SHO for this supernova remnant, but adding a S layer could be part of a future project.",
