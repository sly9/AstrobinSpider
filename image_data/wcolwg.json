    "description": "Credits: José Ignacio Alvarez-Hamelin (Nacho) & Jorge Vaccaro (jorvacc)\r\n \r\nCropped from a full frame image taken with a Nikon 80-200mm @200, F/16. ISO 400, 1/320.\r\n\r\nThis photo was taken on Neuquén Province, Patagonia Argentina. It was a fantastic moment having the adrenaline of taking a good photo and keep watching the breathtaking moment!! We had planned to control the camera with the computer but things didn't  work out last minute so we decided to move to safety, shooting manual.\r\nWe could' t witness 2019 eclipse, here in Argentina too, so we had all our hope put on this event, but the pandemic made anything much complicated. Even living here in Argentina it wasn't  easy to decide going. The decision was made last minute based on weather forecast.",
