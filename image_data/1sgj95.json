    "description": "Here we have an attempt at NGC3628, one of The Leo Triplet and better known as The Hamburger Galaxy.  I'm not fond of this nickname and I prefer to use the Sarah's Galaxy moniker instead after I had the pleasure of viewing a great image done recently by @Michel Makhlouta and reading the excellent project description he provided to go along with the image.  \r\n\r\nThis galaxy season I have managed to capture all three of the members of the Triplet with varying degrees of success.  But I learned a lot and now, at the end of galaxy season I am looking forward to next year.\r\n\r\nI had thought this was the least interesting of the three but I was wrong...  This galaxy is quite active and after reading some material published by Arp et al (https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2002/33/aah3558.pdf) and some other material on quasar.org, I find this to be a very interesting subject indeed.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I have included a secondary image as a revision that contains some annotations of several confirmed quasars, some suspected ones and labeled the X-ray plume coming from NGC3628.  There are more but these were those of which I was reasonably certain were identifiable.  One of them, Wee 52 is purported to be 10.5 Gly distant which, to me anyway, is completely mind bending to consider.\r\n\r\nI was very careful to preserve background details and did not do any aggressive star reduction because of the richness of the background.  \r\n\r\nI tried to bring out the iconic star stream that is associated with the galaxy but just could not make that happen in the way I had hoped, but there is a hint of it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think I have one more galaxy to go that I need to finish and that will be it for galaxies this season.  It has been fun and valuable to me.\r\n\r\nHope you like the image and CS and good health to everyone!",
