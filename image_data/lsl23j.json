    "description": "Hello everyone, Astrobin friends.\r\nAs some of you already know, I have not had much time lately to dedicate to astrophotography, however I continue to take advantage of to improve my configuration, consider changing my mount, I need a more precise and consistent guidance and the path was clear for me, Astro-Physics or\r\nParamount like my good friend Uwe, but again I took a risk for Sky-Watcher, I started it immediately and I could see what I already knew, it was not up to the task, luckily I had a plan, \"astronomyslt.com\" , I had the phone of these guys for a long time and I knew they were professionals, I sent them my new mount and they got to work, informing me and sending me images and videos of the comprehensive tuning process, they also tested my mount for three nights until obtaining spectacular results. (See images D, E and F), now I can say that I have a great mount and some new and good friends, THANK YOU FERNANDO, I owe you some beers.\r\nFor my first test with the new configuration I decided on an object that I already liked, so I compare progress, I hope you like it.\r\n\r\nGreetings friends, take care and clear skies.\r\n\r\nIÃ±igo Gamarra.",
