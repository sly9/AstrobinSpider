    "description": "Cygnus is so rich in striking targets whether narrowband or tradition broadband and here I have eschewed any restraint and allowed the rich narrowband possibilities to display the swirling molecular dust and structures in the gases to their unabashed glory.  The ridge-like VdB130 contrasts with the swirling dark cloud of B344 with its globules and fluted manifold structure - a mysterious delight.\r\n\r\nIt's also been rewarding to capture an image from my home observatory to which I've had to give it a 'birthday' with strengthening my western wall which had warped slightly over the years and had caused a minor slew to my roof's rail; and also a leak on the windward side that took some ingenuity to plug.\r\n\r\nLet me know if the image is too bright ;-) & thanks for looking.",
