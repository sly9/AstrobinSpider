    "description": "Sub-frames acquired by SkyGems Remote Observatory. Unprocessed integrated FITS are available for download.\r\n\r\nThis is a LHaRGB rendition of the starburst galaxy, NGC 253, in the constellation Sculptor. It is pretty dim and only can be viewed with a telescope (actually all objects in the imaging field are too faint to be viewed by naked eye).\r\n\r\nH-alpha data is first black clipped to remove background noise and retain only active regions, then scaled up 4 times and added to the R channel (this way R and Ha are blended with approximately 2:1 ratio). HaRGB channels are all hardware binned to 2x2, then upsampled to align with luminance channel. Heavy denoising and convolution are applied to HaRGB image to smooth out color grains before merging with luminance.\r\n\r\nColor calibration done with AutoColor script in PixInsight, denoised with EZ Denoise script and then stretched. Saturation curves, HDRMultiscaleTransform, LocalHistogramEqualization and UnsharpenMask are applied to bring out more color and sharpness.",
