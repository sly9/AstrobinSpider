    "description": "RCW114 in HaRGB, from Melbourne, Australia.\r\n\r\nPoking around in Galaxy map, I came across this huge but very faint nebula that is rarely if ever photographed by amateurs. \r\n\r\nIt was originally thought to be a ring nebula surrounding the Wolf-Rayet star WR 90, expanding into a pre-existing cavity created by the supernova remnant 343.0-06.0. However, current research suggests that is much closer to us than WR90, so is an Ancient SNR in it's own right.\r\n\r\nIt's big (and dim) too, this is only 1/4 of the region in the FOV - maybe another mosaic required! \r\n\r\nIt's an awesome looking target, but rarely (if ever) photographed in colour. \r\nI scoured the web but could only find references to two images, one on IIS by DVJ and one here on Astrobin by John Gleason. \r\n\r\nFor the curious it's located next to Sargas in Scorpius, 345.07, -6.445 \r\n\r\n7 hrs Ha3nm - 1800sec subs - could do with a lot more data too\r\n8x600sec subs RG&B\r\n\r\nTaken from my light polluted suburban backyard in Melbourne, Australia.",
