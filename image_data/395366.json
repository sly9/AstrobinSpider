    "description": "This is almost 10 hours of M97 taken with C11 RASA . This is ca 50% crop of orginal frame after stacking. I cannot quite manage darks with this camera, having edges bloom, thereofore have to cut heavily. I am happy but not quite, the material after combination with L seems to loose bit of details and sharpness and I cannot conclude why is that. outer ring colour is a bit my interpretation, to make it visible better I had to stretch blue channel quite heavily.",
