    "description": "Another image that from start took over a year to complete, and then few months to get myself to process this image. It has been tough couple of months psyhologically, so I have put away lots of astro stuff, but now I'm trying to get back to it :) I have 2 full images to process and one wfor which I got more RGB frames, so that means I have to redo it :) Also I have finally calibrated my monitor, but as usual, all the profile stuff is making me numb, as now seems PNG's show images incorrectly, ugh. Seems to be chrome's issue though, but not sure really.",
