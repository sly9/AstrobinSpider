    "description": "I've been wondering if I could image this object even though it doesn't get above 21 degrees above the horizon.  I decided to try as my site is at 5600 ft in elevation and has good transparency this time of year.  The end result was pretty good, but I did notice that blues are a bit underdone compared to southern hemisphere images, as would be expected.  This is a 2-panel mosaic.  Each has 80 subs of 100s, using an OSC camera.  The stacked image was 2x2 binned for better post processing speed and noise reduction.",
