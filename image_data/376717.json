    "description": "I know, this is a bit out of date, but I hope, You still like it. The image was done on the early morning on september 15 after my deep sky schedule, and only a few minutes left until astro twighlight. I was surpriesd how beautiful the composition of the open clusters and the comet. If I had had more time, I would have set a better composition, but I like it this way too :-)",
