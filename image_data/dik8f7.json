    "description": "The large filaments that were a filaprom yesterday were lifting off/dissipating today and I caught some of it.  Unfortunately when I reset Firecapture to do another hour of captures (and I left it to go pick up groceries!)  FC shut down for some reason and I didn't get that extra hour on it!  Still a beautiful prom and lovely movement.  60 minutes in real time.",
