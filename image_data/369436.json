    "description": "Just a quicky whilst waiting for the last couple of objects to rise: The good ol' Owl Cluster. Actually I expected not a lot as it was hazy and full moon so overall not the best conditions. The original subs had a massive halo around the cluster which was quite a task to reduce ... \r\n\r\nHowever it was a great excercise to get prettier stars (without Star Spikes pro, which I sometimes used when I was unhappy with how the stars turned out). I recommend having a look in full view.\r\n\r\nRevision D is the full field of view. \r\n\r\nHope you like it :)",
