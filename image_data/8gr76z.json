    "description": "NGC3621 ist located in the southernmost part of Hydra, if you start at the Hamburger Galaxy (NGC3628) just drive 45Â° south. It's pretty big 12x6arcmin and considerably bright (10mag). Its a SA(s)d spiral, and its missing any sign of a bulge. At the very center a massive black hole is suspected, driving the active galactic nucleus - the brightest point at the very center. The outer spiral arms are very delicate to bring out and merge gradually to the background.\r\n\r\nThe picture was taken at Rooisand farm in Namibia in June 2019.",
