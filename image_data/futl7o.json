    "description": "I stumbled on it as an accident when I was looking for targets in the same area (I already shot few of the more famous ones in that region and it is full of gems like this). I couldn't find the designation (Selected it by looking at region in SGP's framing wizard).  The extended view of this region is fascinating with knots of dust and bunch of emission and reflection nebulae all over the place.\r\n\r\n I kept shooting after plate solving it in PI to find that it is designated as Barnard 22.  Apparently the little emission region is IC 2087 called \"Little flame nebula\" !  \r\n\r\nI wish I had framed it better  but I had collected a bunch already  so this will have to do. I have one more target  in this same region and I have to force myself to look at other areas!\r\n\r\n\r\nL - 65 x 10 minutes\r\nR/G/B - 12 x 10 minutes per channel",
