    "description": "The great barred spiral galaxy NGC1365. This is the jewel in the crown of the Fornax cluster and one of the most beautiful galaxies I have seen. I've been aiming to image this galaxy for a while now and was disappointed that there was a lot of high cloud around when i attempted it.  Nonetheless, you can see dust lanes and pink star forming regions. It's great to image with the longer focal length of my 10inch newt which i'm finally able to use again after our lockdown has been finally lifted. Stay safe and clear skies.",
