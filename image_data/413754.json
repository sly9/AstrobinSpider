    "description": "Hi everybody!\r\nThis is a new image from a very recent star party. I was able to collect data for about 4 consecutive days on that one. The sky was really nice only the first day and on the next 3 we've had strong winds and very bad seeing, the trasparence too was getting worst on a daily basis... Anyway this is the result on which I've added few more integrations including about 2 hours of H-Alpha data acquired 2 days later from another location. The subject is LBN 442 (Gecko nebula) and the result soffer of bad seeing and is a little \"blobby and noisy\" but still nice. I will try more integrations soon (I hope). Anyway is about 8h LLRGB+Ha from my usual itinerating setup + some data from a Vixen RSS200...\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by!",
