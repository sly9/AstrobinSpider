    "description": "As I imaged Venus in UV on 19th March the seeing remained good as I continued to make 5 minute captures, alternating with IR captures over 1.5 hours. I was therefore able to produce this animation showing the movement of the cloud features over this timeframe. The planet rotates very slowly, taking 225 Earth days to complete one revolution and the rotation is retrograde. Therefore this motion is entirely due to circulation of the clouds, which move very rapidly. Venus is Earthâ€™s twin! Imagine clouds moving across this much of the Earth in 1.5 hours!",
