    "description": "A target I've tried to get for several years. Thrid year is a charm.\r\nIt is VERY low in my sky in Michigan and so it never raises over 20 degrees above horizon.  I'm in Bortle 6.5 LP with it being much worse LOW near the horizon where this target passes between two trees for a total of 2 hours a night for about a 10 day period before the moon rises. I lucked out with 6 clear nights in a row.  Still it was very hard to process. Lights only, no darks or flats.",
