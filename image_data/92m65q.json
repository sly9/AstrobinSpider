    "description": "Stars vs. Starless.  Starnet++ software has enabled imagers to explore deep images without the eye interference of foreground stars.  The result is a revealing landscape of subtle structures normally lost to the eye. It comes at a cost however with artifacts as a result of the replaced stars, especially in an extremely star-rich field such as this one.   Starnet++ results can be used as a separate layer to enhance faint structures while preserving star intensity.  Image on the right is HRGB, combined with starless layer.",
