    "description": "Arp 77, or NGC1097 in the constellation of Fornax has a lot of peculiar structures, hence its inclusion in Arp's catalogue of 'weirdos'. The disruption in one of its arms is easy enough to see in this image. The unusual optical jets are harder to see, the brightest passes through a small background galaxy at about 10 o'clock. Even more unusual are the anomalously high number of quasars in this field of view.\r\nThis image was taken over 4 nights through the observatory 16\" about 18 hours worth of images in all.",
