    "description": "I started this project already a year ago, but never got around to processing the data. During February and March I shot some more frames and finally the pictures is ready for presentation. The area is very interesting as it contains two supernova remnants (the Jellyfish and the background filaments) and the emission nebula SH2-249. The Jellyfish has abundant SII emission but the SH2-249 has almost none. The nebula was processed as SHO, stars are RGB.",
