    "description": "This image is my first attempt at using a guided setup. I spent many frustrating nights recently learning how to make guiding work for my mount, it was not a simple setup and the myriad of software used added greatly to the complexity.\r\n\r\nAfter spending ~2 hours setting up and polar aligning, I was finally happy with the guiding accuracy I was seeing. I decided to still keep the exposure length on the shorter side and not push my luck too much on my first guided shoot.\r\n\r\nThis was shot at my local park which is under Bortle 8-9 skies.",
