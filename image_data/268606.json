    "description": "Moving along to a more commonly imaged object, this target has become somewhat of a benchmark of mine.   This is actually my fourth attempt at it.   The first two are absolutely not worth posting.   My third attempt with a DSLR can be seen here.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://astrob.in/135986/D/\"><img src=\"http://astrob.in/135986/D/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg\"/></a>\r\n\r\n... and finally I got around to trying it with my current setup.   There is no doubt that this is my best interpretation of the target, but feel I still have quite a number of possible improvements.   I won't do a detailed write-up on this one since most readers know what's going on here (or is a short Wikipedia visit away).    \r\n\r\nOne of the things that I struggled with here was that there is faint IFN throughout the area.  It's hard to process the undulating background without making it look like an accident.  In the end I just chose to keep the background low and display the galaxies and not focus on the depth of the integration.   My light pollution situation makes a clean interpretation of the IFN difficult anyway.  \r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
