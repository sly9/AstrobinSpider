Their declination is strongly Southern (DEC -77), they can be observed exclusively from the regions of the southern hemisphere. IC 2631 reflection nebula is the brightest part of the Chameleon molecular cloud in which the phenomena of star formation creating low-mass stars takes place . This cloud is of great importance in the study of the formation of planetary systems and brown dwarfs.\r\nGN11.07.3 is the orange triangular nebula - an infrared nebula. \r\n\r\nExposures:\r\nThe upper part of the mosaic contains:\r\n12xR, 10xG, 10xB all 5 minute exposures.\r\nThe lower part of the mosaic contains\r\n14xR, 16xG, 18xB all 5 minute exposures.\r\nTotal 400 minutes.\r\nUsing a SBIG ST11K on a Takahashy FSQ 106 with 530 mm focal length on a Paramount ME mount.\r\n\r\nAll images were exposed remotely on the T12 of Siding Spring iTelescop Farm.\r\nJune 9th and 10th 2016 and August 9th, 10th 2016",
