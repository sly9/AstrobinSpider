    "description": "This object is actually a series of objects located in the constellation of Vulpecula.  VdB 126 is the central bright blue reflection nebula, reflecting the light of the hot blue star behind it.  Similarly, LBN 133 is the blue reflection nebula to the right of center.Two prominent dark nebulae are also present - LDN 768 to the left of center, and LDN 772 to the upper right.   All four of these nebulae are surrounded by the dense star field in this part of the Milky Way.    \r\n\r\nThis is one of the few deep sky objects where I can clearly see and understand the reason for its nickname.",
