    "description": "The Cat's Eye Nebula is a planetary nebula in the northern constellation of Draco, discovered by William Herschel on February 15, 1786.\nThis one was a bit of a challenge to process. It has a very bright core and very faint dust towards the outer part of the Nebula and was difficult to try and resolve detail in the center as well as bring out the fee details. HOO. Color palette. Total integration time 12.5 hours",
