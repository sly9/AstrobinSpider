    "description": "The constellation of Cepheus is literally bathed in Milky Way dust structures.   Near the center of the frame is the popular Iris Nebula.  I admit that it is barely recognizable when you step back this far.   The bright blue stars are some of the main visual stars of Cepheus.       \r\n\r\nI was finally able to get out from underneath a light dome and shoot some wide and fast exposures in sky measuring 21.7 SQM.   The astrophotography, well, was definitely like nothing like I am used to!   I've never even travelled with any of my equipment before.    It was a whole new experience, mostly plagued by rookie mistakes.    I also had to tend to a dew problem that actually led to a nice diffusion effect on the bright stars.  I decided to leave those frames in the stack because I rather liked the wash-of-color appearance.\r\n\r\nBut, the simplest rig I could muster gave the best result.    This includes a Canon 6D with a Rokinon 135mm at f/2 on a Celestron AVX mount.   It was shot with an intervalometer cable release and centered using the mount's hand controller.   \r\n\r\n+1 for simplifying your life.",
