    "description": "Version A is a keogram of last night (20/21 June 2020). It is a panorama made from the central verical line of each seperate image from the AllSky camera. You can see stars and sometimes clouds passing the meridian in a keogram. Near the middle of the image you can find the constellations of Swan and Lyra.\r\n\r\nAt 53 North lattitude, there is only astronomical twilight for a month before and after summer solstice as you can clearly see in this image. Only narrowband imaging is possible now.\r\nTime scale is in UTC and local time is UTC+2. \r\n\r\n<A HREF =\"http://astropix.nl/allsky/videos/allsky-20200620.mp4\"TARGET=\"_blank\"> <B>Click here </B></A> to see the AllSky movie of the shortest night.\r\n\r\nVersion B was made on 21 September, a lot more hours of imaging time!",
