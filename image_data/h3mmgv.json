    "description": "I love this classic target because it has such strong signal in all three narrowband channels which can really make for great color variation and contrast. In fact, it took me forever to choose those colors tones for the SHO palette, there are so many beautiful options! This is my first time capturing Rosette in a wider FOV, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much HA signal there is surrounding it.\r\n\r\nI've included a greener toned version as Revision B. Let me know which you like best :)",
