    "description": "Most recent attempt at M33. I collected new data over two nights and improved the processing a lot compared to my first attempt. I like this one a lot more than my initial version, but I still have work to do. This would benefit from a good deal more time for luminance. However, since the moon is too full to collect more data at the moment, I'm making the best out of what I have now.",
