    "description": "This is a project I thought of after the stimulating exchange we had with Gary and Andy in the Fine-art astrophotography topic. I wanted to capture in this image the feeling I had when I thought about the moment when the nuclear reactions sparked in the center of the Sun and our dearest star had lit up. Before that moment, our solar nebula was dark. Even emission nebulae are emitting because they are ionized by a nearby star. We always somehow take the Sunlight for granted, just like we do with the concept of day, since we never experienced anything else. This contrast between dark clouds where no light shines and the star forming regions the emit the light that finally illuminates the Universe is perfectly substantiated by the North America Nebula situated in Cygnus, close to Deneb, at around 1600 ly (exact distance not known). \r\n\r\nI managed to include data from 2 nights at a darker site in the mountains, Bortle 4. The main data comes from my backyard. Clear skies !",
