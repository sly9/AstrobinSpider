    "description": "A very brief experiment in combining short 30s exposures from my red zone backyard. Also sorting out my new gear (Quattro f4 8\" scope) with the aim of seeing what can be captured completely in one night after dinner with work the next day. Its a portable setup so requires setting up (inc collimation), alignment and packing down. So all a bit grainy and lacking depth but some potential to build upon I hope.",
