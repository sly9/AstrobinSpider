    "description": "My team colleague Xavier Strottner and I are delighted and incredibly proud to present our latest discovery, the new faint candidate for a planetary nebula in the constellation Hydra, which has been catalogued by Pascal Le DÃ» as \" STROTTNER-DRECHSLER 47\" (StDr47).\r\nAlthough the object is undoubtedly a real planetary nebula, a spectrum will definitely confirm its status.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFrom the discovery to the finished photo it was a long and difficult way.\r\nMany, many dozens of working hours were necessary, research, analysis, programming of the telescope, monitoring of the photos in a total of 8 nights, spread over April and May 2020 and of course the hours of processing the photos. But considering this wonderful discovery, we can say that the exertions were worth it.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSTROTTNER-DRECHSLER 47\r\nCoordinates: 09:27:31.485 -23:22:34.44\r\nConstellation: Hydra\r\nDiameter 4 arc minutes\r\n\r\nTotal exposure time: 28 hours\r\n-12.3 hours H-alpha\r\n-12.7 hours OIII\r\n-3 hours RGB\r\n\r\nTelescope: 1m RC, Chilescope\r\nCamera: fli 16803 proline",
