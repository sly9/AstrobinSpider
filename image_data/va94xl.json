    "description": "A small company my good friends were running in Tokyo went bankrupt because of an unreliable investor. This is the sad result of their hard pioneering work and I was shamefully lucky to get one of their office PCs for free, a Thinkpad E590 coring an i5. Although my own Fujitsu laptop sports an i7, the Thinkpad's USB-3 port processes and saves my ASI camera's images to HDD much faster without buffering at constantly fast fps, feeling like a new imaging era with fairer chances to outrun clouds. Stacking in AS!3 takes longer with the Thinkpad, but good data is more important. \r\n\r\nIn spite of high air humidity the atmosphere was quiet enough to risk imaging with a 3x barlow.\r\n\r\nThe original (final) image taken without barlow, FL=750mm, 1ms, gain 100, 6x mosaic. \r\n\r\nAll images are stacks of 400 out of 4000, raw8 color frames, pre-sharpened (20%) and 1.5x drizzled in AS!3, further processed in Photoshop CS2.",
