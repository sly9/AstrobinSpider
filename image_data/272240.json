    "description": "What a beautiful sky area!\r\n\r\nThis dusty wide field view includes the bright blue Iris reflection nebula (NGC-7023) on the left as well as the Ghost Nebula (Vdb-141) on the right  \r\n\r\n. The Ghost Nebula (Sh2-136) is around 2 light years across and 1200 light years away. The Ghost Nebula shown in the middle of the image is a reflection nebula that has several embedded stars. These stars give the nebula an brown color. The nebula itself consists of numerous Bok globules - areas where the dust and gas is condensing to form protostars.\r\n\r\n. The Iris Nebula lays in the constellation of Cepheus (left on the picture). It is a complex mixture of reflection, emission and dark nebulosity surrounding a 7.4 magnitude star that illuminates the struture. The Iris Nebula is located 1,300 light-years away with an estimated size of 5.6 light-years in diameter.",
