    "description": "The Spindle galaxy NGC3115 is about 32 million light years away in the constellation Sextans. At magnitude 9.9 it's relatively bright and is seen almost exactly side on, which is why it appears so thin. There's an interesting bulge above and to the left of the nucleus if you zoom right in, as well as chains of globular clusters near the galactic disk. The 17th magnitude dwarf galaxy UGC200 is visible to the left of the image centre and is part of the same group as the spindle.",
