    "description": "I am fortunate that the CDK 1000 allows imaging the Pillars at high resolution. There are of course many images of M16, it is always interesting to see the detail around the area of the pillars.\nImaged on our CDK 1000 in SHO at Obstech, El Sauce, Chile\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\nSystem Control Software: Voyager by Leo Orazi",
