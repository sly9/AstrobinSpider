    "description": "This is the second image from my new yet old Meade 10\" ACF SCT. I like the tighter FOV to really get to the core of bright nebula like M16 and M17. I am currently working on M20 and IC5146. Here are the Pillars of Creation in M16 in SHO Hubble Palette. \r\n\r\nThe Eagle Nebula (Messier 16 or  NGC 6611) is a young open cluster of stars in the constellation Serpens. The Eagle Nebula is part of a diffuse emission nebula, or H II region, which is catalogued as IC 4703. This region of active current star formation is about 7000 light-years distant. A spire of gas that can be seen coming off the nebula in the northeastern part is approximately 9.5 light-years or about 90 trillion kilometers long.\r\n\r\nThe cluster associated with the nebula has approximately 8100 stars, which are mostly concentrated in a gap in the molecular cloud to the north-west of the Pillars. The brightest star (HD 168076) has an apparent magnitude of +8.24, easily visible with good binoculars. It is actually a binary star formed of an O3.5V star plus an O7.5V companion. This star has a mass of roughly 80 solar masses, and a luminosity up to 1 million times that of the Sun. The cluster's age has been estimated to be 1â€“2 million years. The descriptive names reflect impressions of the shape of the central pillar rising from the southeast into the central luminous area.",
