    "description": "This incredibly detailed view of the iconic Horsehead Nebula was photographed in infrared light by the Hubble Telescope in 2013.   This image was assembled by downloading the publicly available original calibrated data from the MAST archive - https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/heritage/horsehead/\r\n\r\nThe processing of the data was performed by me using PixInsight and Photoshop.  \r\n\r\nWhile dark nebula are generally invisible (except of course where back lit as in the case of the Horsehead), their dust grains very effectively absorb light and ultraviolet radiation and then re-radiate this energy at infrared wavelengths.  This false color image was assembled with data from two of Hubble's wideband infrared filters - f110w and f160w - and nicely captures that re-radiated energy.\r\n\r\nColor Assignments: red - f160w, green - f110w, blue - f110w",
