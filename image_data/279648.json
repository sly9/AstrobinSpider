    "description": "The Pleiades is an open star cluster very close to us, around 440 light years, in the constellation of Taurus. It can be easily spotted to the naked eye from suburban skies. It contains hot and extremely luminous B-type stars that have formed within the last 100 million years and the brightest of them are surrounded by interstellar dust that forms a faint reflection nebulosity that can be seen in long exposure photographs. Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to the strong winds that comes from these stars and the gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.",
