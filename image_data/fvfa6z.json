    "description": "I live at 51 degrees North and we don't have astronomical darkness here around this time of the year. Despite that, I was surprised to see parts of the intergalactic cirrus around the Fireworks galaxy. The visibility of the dust is enhanced in the full field of view. \r\n\r\nYou can also see that my sensor is tilted diagonally, I hope I can fix this with a tilt adapter. I won't be able to use an OAG + tilt adapter due to the limited backfocus of the GPU corrector though. Suggestions for improvement are welcome!",
