    "description": "I tried uploading this a couple times last night and said Bad Gateway. After work today I saw there was 3 of them with no information, so sorry if it appeared I uploaded so many with no info. lol\r\n\r\nAs much as I love the contrast and color of the Hubble Palette, I do love the natural look equally as well, so I decided to do a more natural bicolor version as too. \r\n\r\nThe Eagle Nebula is a 5.5 million-year-old cloud of molecular hydrogen gas and dust stretching approximately 70 light years by 55 light years. Inside the nebula, gravity pulls clouds of gas together to collapse inward. If enough gas is present, nuclear fusion is ignited in the center, and the compact cloud becomes a shining star. The Eagle Nebula is thought to have several star-forming regions within it.\r\n\r\nThe Eagle Nebula lies 6,500 light-years away in the inner spiral arm of the Milky Way next to our own, the Sagittarius or Sagittarius-Carina Arm. When viewing the sky, the stellar nursery is found within the constellation of Serpens, the Serpent.\r\n\r\nOne of the best-known pictures of the Eagle Nebula is the Hubble Space Telescope image taken in 1995, highlighting the \"Pillars of Creation.\" The three columns contain the materials for building new stars, and stretch four light-years out into space. Newborn stars outside of the famous Hubble image are responsible for sculpting the pillars, using ultraviolet light to burn away some of the gas within the clouds.",
