    "description": "Enjoy this detailed look into the mineralogy of the moon. By saturating the natural color and boosting the contrast between features, the lunar surface comes alive with new perspective.\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\r\nThe colors represent the different soils and layers created through chemical and mechanical processes. Some examples of this include the bright rays deposited by impact ejecta, vast plains created by ancient lava flows, and the darkening effects of space weathering. Peer deep into this image and the more you will see.",
