    "description": "APOD! Thats awesome news !!! :-)\r\n\r\nWell, hello guys and girls...:-) thats my attempt to process NGC 1672...hope you enjoy this rendition !\r\n\r\n\"The barred spiral galaxy NGC 1672, showing up clusters of hot young blue stars along its spiral arms, and clouds of hydrogen gas glowing in red. Delicate curtains of dust partially obscure and redden the light of the stars behind them. NGC 1672's symmetric look is emphasised by the four principal arms, edged by eye-catching dust lanes that extend out from the centre.\"\r\n\r\nSource: Hubble site...\r\n\r\nWarm Regards !!!",
