    "description": "A widefield view of the Bubble, the Lobster Claw and the Northern Lagoon Nebula. Captured with the Celestron RASA 8\" and processed in the Hubble Palette. \r\n\r\nI really liked the green hue so I decided not remove it. Maybe I'll post an other version with the classic Hubble Palette Colors. Lots of post-processing time went into carefully sharpening the Bubble.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it, comments are appreciated as always :)",
