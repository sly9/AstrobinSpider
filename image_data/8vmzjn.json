    "description": "Abell 33 (PK238.0+34.8 ) is a commonly imaged Abell planetary nebula  about 2700 light years distant in Hydra. Abell33 is a large size Abell, measuring 4.5 arc minutes and has a magnitude listed at 12.6, fairly bright for an Abell. It shows well on the RGB image. The Ha signal is weaker than the Oiii signal, but both are strong. Both signals form a perfectly round disk, with a bright progenitor star in the middle.\r\n\r\nThis PN has what I find to be two very interesting stars:  the very large star on the exact edge, and a very tiny white star almost perfectly sitting on top of the central progenitor star.  I have not seen this mentioned before.\r\n\r\nMy Collections:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2627/\" target=\"_new\">Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2626/\" target=\"_new\">Galaxies</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2625/\" target=\"_new\">Sharpless 2 Objects</a>",
