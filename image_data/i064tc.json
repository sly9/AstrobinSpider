    "description": "This is part of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The large dark nebula in the centre is Barnard 7, surrounding LBN 782, a blue reflection nebula. To the left is vdB 27, lit up by the young variable star RY Tauri. Another reflection nebula to the right is illuminated by CW Tauri. In the bottom right the eliptical galaxy IC 359 shines through the dust from 186 light years away.\r\n\r\nThis is 6.6 hours of data from a Tak Epsilon 130 and ASI071 posted on SGL by Richard Sweeney for anyone to process to comfort us during the corona closedown. I did it mainly in PS.\r\nThanks a lot Richard!\r\nhttps://stargazerslounge.com/topic/350599-3-data-stacks-to-play-with-during-lockdown/\r\nRichards own great version and details on the data:\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/375000/C/",
