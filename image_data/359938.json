    "description": "Barry and I photographed the 'Witch's Broom' back in June & July 2018.  On review, we felt that it would be worth extending the image to include the nearby Pickering’s triangle.  This, therefore, is a two panel mosaic of the Witch’s Broom and Pickering’s Triangle imaged between 19 June and 6 August 2018.  \r\n\r\nThe Veil Nebula complex is a supernova remnant located some 1,500 light years away in the constellation of Cygnus. It is believed that the original supernova would have been visible on Earth around 3,000 - 6,000 BC.\r\n\r\nData were captured from a remote imaging rig located in Spain jointly owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nCamera: QSI 683 WSG\r\nFilters: Astrodon 5nm\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\nHa: 41 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 39 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 26.7 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData Capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
