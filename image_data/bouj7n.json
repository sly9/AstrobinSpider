    "description": "My girlfriend and I planned this trip a long time ago… and here we are! On Saturday, we gathered a lot of camping as well as astrophotography equipment. On Sunday, at around 4AM, everything was packed up in two backpacks, weighting respectively 18 and 20kg… Then, after just a few hours of sleep, we left for Täsch and took the train to Zermatt. We arrived at the Stellisee at 5PM and needed to wait for the sunset! At midnight, when we installed the camp, there were around 10 other astrophotographers with us!\r\n\r\nThe Stellisee is a famous spot for day and nighttime photography. Its unique view of the Matterhorn is very impressive, with a nice water reflection. Lying at 2550 meters above sea level, the temperature was freezing cold, even in July.\r\n\r\nThe mountain at the center is the Matterhorn, one of the most emblematic mountains of the Alps. The summit is 4478 meters high, making it the sixth highest peak in the Alps. In this picture, the Matterhorn is showing its east and north faces. From 4AM till the sunrise, we saw a dozen of people climbing the north-east ridge.\r\n\r\nThis picture was taken at 2.30AM and totalize 30 minutes of exposure. The bright light on the left is not a star, it’s actually the arrival of the Klein Matterhorn lift.\r\n\r\n10x2min for the sky, 5x2min for the foreground. Lens: 24mm @ f/4\r\n\r\nVersion B: Screen format (16:9)",
