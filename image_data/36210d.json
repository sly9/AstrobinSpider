    "description": "You could say that NGC 1097 is a twisted mess. The small, but mighty, companion galaxy NGC 1097a has created large scale tidal debris and distortions in its much larger neighbor.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are four faint jets, made of stars, indicating that NGC 1097 cannibalized a dwarf galaxy in the distant past. To top it off, NGC 1097 is a Seyfert galaxy with a super massive black hole in its core.\r\n\r\nThis is an RGB image processed with a synthetic luminance.\r\n\r\nTech Notes for ASA 500/3.6:\r\nASA Newtonian, 500 mm aperture, 1900mm focal length, F3.6\r\nFLI Proline 16803, 9 mm pixel, 4096 X 4096\r\nASA DDM85 equatorial mount\r\nProcessing with PixInsight, StarTools, and Affinity Photo",
