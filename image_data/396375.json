    "description": "I was doing some test shoots on the Orion nebula, the only problem was after the test I could not stop shooting.  So, after 10+ years I have made a new picture of this eternal beauty :-)\r\n\r\nA goal of processing was to retain the natural brightness relations to some extent. So the brighter parts also look brighter, not at the same or ever lowen level than the weak nebulosity - as is seen so often in HDR pictures nowadays.\r\n\r\nEos6d at Iso800 3min throughout, and some shoots 30sec at Iso400 and Iso100 for the bright core.",
