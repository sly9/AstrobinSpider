    "description": "This image captures a reflection nebula (IC 5076) and a star cluster (NGC 6991), both located 6000 light years away in the constellation of Cygnus.  The blue reflection nebula is reflecting the light from the brightest star in the star cluster.  This star, HD 199478, is a variable blue supergiant with an average magnitude of 5.7.  This star is bright enough to cause artifacts with my camera.\r\n\r\nMy favorite aspect of this image is the brownish dust cloud which lies just above the reflection nebula.  The contrast between the brownish dust cloud and the blue reflection nebula is pleasing to me.  \r\n\r\nThe dense star field surrounding these objects is orange tinged due to the large amount of dust in this part of the sky.",
