    "description": "I wanted to get a more detailed view of the Jellyfish's thick area - something that might look very interesting on a metal print, so I re-captured it with my bigger refractor and still cropped around the edges even more.  Bad weather prevented me from capturing as much data as I wanted and the forecast does not look promising, so I went ahead and worked with what I had.",
