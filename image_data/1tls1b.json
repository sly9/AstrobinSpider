    "description": "One of the 'iconic' astronomy objects that triggered my interest in observing the skies many years ago, Centaurus A has ever been on my whishlist to observe myself.  Unfortunately, even from the Canary Islands it never rises higher than 18 degrees above the horizon.  But I had to try.\r\nStar sizes and guiding RMS were twice what I usually accept as limit, so resolution isn't great, and thus I've binned down the image 2x.",
