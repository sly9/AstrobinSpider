    "description": "I have wanted to image this planetary nebula since it was first discovered in 2008. The field of view is only 12 arc minutes wide, no cropping. It’s a total of 44.5 hours of data that I captured from 23 nights of imaging from August 11-Oct. 22, 2020. Oh and I threw out about 25 hours of data. This image scale is a big challenge. I used my processing technique which I call ‘Spectral Palette’ using Ha in red close to its wavelength, OIII as a green/blue close to its wavelength and Hb as blue close to its wavelength. The stars are from regular RGB filters. The colour of the gold bubble is a combination of Ha and OIII, which is correct as when you add red and green light, you get yellow. There was a lot of OIII in the bubble. The Hb adds blue to the red nebulosity giving a more fuchsia richer colour. Hb shines through when there is little dust to attenuate it. I think it looks like a Christmas tree ornament in front of a lit-up Christmas tree. It's such a perfect sphere.\r\nR:G:B:Ha:OIII:Hb  3.5: 3.0: 3.5: 15: 9: 10 hours",
