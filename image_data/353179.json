    "description": "This is a (2)Panel mosaic that includes Sh2-64 and LDN 557\r\nI have to say I was surprised by this area of the sky, this is not uncommon becaues I am regularly surprised by what shows up. But a low texture translucent and water like nebula,  not very common!\r\n\r\nOverlaying a rich starfield is a large molecular cloud. This cloud is both reflecting light and absorbing. This cloud is partialy obscuring several bright stars in the foreground the brightest is mangitude V 5.49 and  a KOIII type just a tad bluer than our Sun.\r\n\r\nAlmost obscured is Sharpless Sh2 64 above center and slightly right below the bright 5th magnitude star HIP 90642.  Sh2 64 is just peeking out of the cloud, which I think is a very nice effect. Near the bottom and nearly centered are LDN563 with LDN557 combine into what looks like a shark.\r\n\r\nThis image was a lot of fun and easy to process.  I'd suggest adding this to your list.\r\n\r\nI have included as the origianal an annotated image to help.",
