    "description": "Well, since the weather here in the Midwest is so lousy during the winter, I subscribed to Telescope Live, so I'd have some new data to process during the cloudy cold winter.  This was the first set of data that I downloaded (only 3 1/2 hours total of HA, OIII, and SII).  I was pleasantly surprised that, for such a short amount of TOT, the image came out pretty good.  I know that I'm cheating by using data that I haven't taken myself, but I couldn't get up close and personal like this with my rig!\r\nHope ya like it!\r\nTom",
