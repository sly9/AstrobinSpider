    "description": "I really loved the cave nebula I got in my widefield shot even though that was narrowband, that I decided to go big. Quite happy with overall result, and waiting for next autumn to get narrowband data on it as well. One interesting thing I learnt while processing this image is that LRGBCombination with \"chrominance noise reduction\" checkbox enabled created some weird halos around some of the stars, I even nearly gave up figuring out what is causing the issue, but tried disabling this option just for the sake of it and it worked, so I am really happy I managed to solve it :)",
