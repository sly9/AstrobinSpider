    "description": "I am trying to process most of the planetary nebula data in the Liverpool Telescope data base. For this one there was not much data, only 8 usable subs and totally 9 min of exposures. Considering the low amount of data the image did not turn out to be too bad, and this is in any case a rather featureless nebula.\r\n\r\nFilters and exposures:\r\nsdss-r  30 s and 120 s (red channel)\r\nHa  30 s (red channel)\r\nBessell V  30 s and 120 s (green channel)\r\nBessell B  30 s and 120 s (blue channel)\r\nsdss-g  30 s (blue channel)",
