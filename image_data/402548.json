    "description": "The Tarantula Nebula is located in the outskirts of the Large Magellanic Cloud and is considered the only deep sky object (except galaxies) outside of our Milky Way visible from Earth, with the aid of binoculars or telescopes. It is so large that, if it was placed in the Orion Nebula region, it would appear with the size of 60 full Moons and would cast shadows.",
