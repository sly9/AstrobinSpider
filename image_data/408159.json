    "description": "Not a high resolution image as I chose to take this at bin 4x4 and 2x2 to speed up the image acquisition and I really wanted to get the Soap Bubble Nebula and with the shorter lighter nights approaching I did not want to let this one run till next year.\r\n\r\nNarrowband images taken as bins 4x4 and 2x2 and stars taken at bin 2x2 and a few at 1x1. Narrowband data processed after star removal with Starnet++ and RGB stars added back.\r\n\r\nStarnet++ removed all the stars and I did not need to do any manual touching up, a fantastic program.\r\n\r\nImaged over 6 nights May 11-21 2019",
