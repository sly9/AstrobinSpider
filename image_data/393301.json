    "description": "SH2-157 - emission nebula in the constellation Cassiopeia. It's also called as Lobster Claw nebula.\r\nThe northern part of the nebula has a ring shape, which is caused by the stellar wind of several giant stars. At the same time, the southern sector is illuminated by hot stars of spectral class O. Inside the nebula there is an open star cluster consisting of young stars.\r\n\r\nThe Bubble Nebulae (NGC7635), NGC7538, a part of SH2-161, and a NGC7510 open cluster are also present in the full-size image.",
