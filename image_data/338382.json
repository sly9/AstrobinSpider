    "description": "56 million light years away, in the constellation of Volans, there is a dramatic lopsided intermediate spiral galaxy known as the Meathook Galaxy.  Its asymmetric shape has one arm tightly folded in, while the other is dotted with star forming regions that extend far out from its galactic nucleus.  These regions are trailing off to the left on the lower arm, and have a slightly pink and reddish colours.\r\n\r\nThe galaxy itself is around 110,000 light years across and is moving away from us at 1466 kilometres per second.    I have always enjoyed looking at interesting shaped galaxies as usually have an interesting history.   In this instance, around 200 million years ago, there may have been a gravitational interaction with the fuzzy galaxy to the lower right, AM 0738-692.   If you look carefully, there is a fairly easy to spot almost edge background galaxy, around the two o’clock position. \r\n\r\nWithin inner region of NGC 2442, there is a background galaxy just popping through.  I had to resort to some Hubble images to verify, and there it was.  That is so cool to be able to see a galaxy through a closer galaxy.  To locate it, draw a line from the core, moving outwards toward the 4:30 clock position, and there is what looks like a horizontal line perpendicular to the line you have just drawn out.  It is very subtle.  Another feature to help locate it, look at the ends of a forked brownish structure that connects back to the core of the galaxy.  There are quite a few dim, far off galaxies throughout the frame.\r\n\r\nExposure Details\r\n16 Blue Binned 2X2 – 450 Sec each\r\n17 Green Binned 2X2 – 450 Sec each\r\n19 Red Binned 2X2 – 450 Sec each\r\n19 Lum Binned 1X2 – 900 Sec each\r\n14 Ha Binned 1x1 – 1200 Sec\r\n\r\nInstruments Used:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter",
