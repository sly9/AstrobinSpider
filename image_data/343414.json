    "description": "Wizard Nebula - NGC 7380\r\n\r\nWhat powers are being wielded in the Wizard Nebula? Gravitation strong enough to form stars, and stellar winds and radiations powerful enough to create and dissolve towers of gas. Located only 8,000 light years away, the Wizard nebula, pictured above, surrounds developing open star cluster NGC 7380. Visually, the interplay of stars, gas, and dust has created a shape that appears to some like a fictional medieval sorcerer.\r\n\r\nTech details:\r\nSky-Watcher NEQ 6 Pro tuned by HAS, Takahashi FSQ-106N, Moravian G2-8300 with Astrodon 3nm filters. 20x1800s Ha + 16x1800s [OIII] + 17x1800s [SII]. (26.5h.)\r\nTaken from my backyard observatory. Valencia (Spain).\r\nProcessed in PixInsight.",
