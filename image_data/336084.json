    "description": "Taken from Deep Sky West in November and December 2017. I have had the Stellarvue Raptor 105 for maybe 5 years and used it very little at home because I also have the \"better\" TOA-130 and FSQ-106 at home. I only started to use it when it went to DSW because it was available and not used much at home. It is not at all bad- I should have used it more. Too hard to separate dates taken and filters so I just put in date of the last data taken.",
