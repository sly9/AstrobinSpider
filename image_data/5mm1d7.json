    "description": "This well known nebula is visible from the Southern Hemisphere and is situated in Centaurus at around 6000 ly away. It contains the Bok globules discovered by David Thackeray in 1965, visible in the upper left part, near the cluster. They are therefore called 'Thackeray globules'. But apparently no stars are forming inside (Wikipedia).\r\n\r\nI reinstalled Pixinsight 1.8.8.4 in order to be able to use the Starnet module since the starfield is pretty dense and I used a standard SHO luminance in order to obtain the information from all the channels. Stars were really bloated in S2 but the S channel contains significant nebular information. So finally the star control looks acceptable thanks to Starnet : ).",
