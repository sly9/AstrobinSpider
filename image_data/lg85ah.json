    "description": "Lynds Dark Nebula (LDN) 1251 is a large star forming molecular cloud located about 1,000 light-years away in the constellation Cepheus.  It is one of many sites of low and intermediate mass star formation making up the region known as the Cepheus Flare.  My FOV is estimated to be ~10 light-years in width.\r\n\r\nWithin the various patches of faint clouds captured here lurk some ever-interesting Herbig-Haro objects, a few of which are labelled in my annotated version, including HH 149, HH 189, and HH 189 C.  A few distant galaxies are also visible around the edges of the cloud, barely visible through our dusty line-of-sight.\r\n\r\nI really love this object.
