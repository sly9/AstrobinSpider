    "description": "I had to struggle extremely with this picture. Recorded with the Chilescope, there were extreme gradients in luminance and red channel - nobody knows what went wrong. Incident the red channel which brightened up to 3/4 of the picture.\r\n\r\nFor 3 1/2 months now I have been working on the picture to save what can be saved. Fortunately, I have a lot of patience. And even if you take a closer look and see what is wrong, I still find it very successful!\r\n\r\n2 hours and 10 minutes of luminance.\r\n30 minutes per color channel\r\n\r\nHope you like it.",
