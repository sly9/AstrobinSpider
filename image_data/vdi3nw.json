    "description": "The Geminid meteor shower will come in 2020 as scheduled. Before and after December 14, China Lijiang Gemini Observatory and I have combined meteor monitoring with remote stations. After several consecutive days of testing, the average number of catches per day is: Sony a7s camera has 1000 + and Sony imx291 webcam has 400 +. The effect is very good. In this photo, the brightest meteor is selected as the base image, and the meteors in other photos before and after are aligned to the bottom image.",
