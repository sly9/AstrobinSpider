    "description": "The Gecko Nebula, LBN 437, is a molecular cloud in the constellation Lacerta and is paired with the large emission nebula Sh2-126 that runs through this frame.  The left lobe of the Gecko contains many bright stars that were newly formed from the cloud.  In this region, the young star V375 is associated with the X-shaped Herbig-Haro object HH398.   These objects are bright regions of nebulosity associated with newborn stars, and are formed when gas ejected by the star collides with nearby clouds of gas and dust.",
