    "description": "The Fish Head Nebula is a bright emission nebula with complex regions of dark nebula attached to the Heart Nebula complex located at a distance of 6,000-7,500 ly. This image was made using Ha, OIII, and SII narrowband filters and combined using the Hubble palette.\r\n\r\nI struggled a bit to grab all of the data I needed to process this image through periods of wind and mediocre seeing. I wound up processing this data using 64 bit integrated data to insure that the processed data remained above any quantization limits and it worked out pretty well. I always struggle a bit deciding how to control the green cast in any HSO composition and this image was no exception. In the end, I went with with the green component dialed way back to produce the blue/yellow/orange variation presented in this image.  Hopefully it works for you folks.\r\n\r\nAs always, C&C is welcome so feel free to let me know what you think...\r\n\r\nJohn",
