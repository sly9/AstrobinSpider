    "description": "Two reflection nebulae, IC4603 in centre of image and Rho Ophiuchi at lower right.  Tried cropping out the partial reflection nubulae at left and bottom of image but judged the widefield image looked better.  Frames acquired in Queenstown, New Zealand on nights with thin high altitude hazy clouds and was surprised how these conditions seemed not to affect the final image.  The yellow colours seem real and are noted in Bracken's Astrophotography Sky Atlas.  Image scale shown 2.214 arcsec/pixel.  Image field of view 2deg 50' by 2deg 7'\r\n\r\nTotal integration time 5.6 hours of 67 5 min subframes L:21, R:16. G:14. B:16.  Camera gain 100 (0.095 e-/ADU), camera temperature -16degC.  Subframes calibrated with flat & bias frames, flats were cailbrated with dark frames only.
