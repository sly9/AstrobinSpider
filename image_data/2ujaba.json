    "description": "The witch head nebula! Finally  managed to shoot this. I have attempted to shoot this before from Austin and actually managed to get this in spite of the LP (using the faster E130D scope). The target is quite bright for a non emission target. The field is also very colorful and littered with some pretty spiral galaxies. I Also got couple of asteroids (posted as a video earlier). OVerall, a very rewarding region to image. \r\n\r\nI did shoot some Ha (about 8 frames) but ended up not using it. This is pure LRGB image and the Ha is visible . I did shoot 15 min L subs and each of the frame has a lot of signal (The whole nebula is clearly visible in a single frame than I ever got in my backyard)\r\n\r\nProcessed in PI and PS\r\nCamera gain: 26, Offset 10\r\n\r\nL - 46x15 minutes\r\nR/G/B - 12x15 minutes per channel",
