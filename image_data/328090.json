    "description": "Revision B adds RGB for stars and background.  I particularly like the small blue star in the very center of the nebula.  I wonder if it has any special significance.\r\n\r\nAbell 31 is an ancient planetary nebula in the constellation of Cancer. It is estimated to be about 2,000 light years away. Although it is one of the largest planetary nebulae in the sky, it is not very bright.",
