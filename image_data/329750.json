    "description": "The Tadpoles Nebula was the other object that I captured along side the Heart Nebula. Basically, the Heart before midnight, and the Tadpoles after midnight. This is another reason why it took me nearly three months to finish either project. :)\r\n\r\nFor processing, I went through quite a few iterations to get to these colors. Hopefully, it reveals the intricate details of the nebula well.",
