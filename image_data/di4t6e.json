    "description": "Dim Planetary Nebula at Cancer, really dim.\r\nWith a surface magnitude of  27 arc-sec-1, it was discovered in 1955 by George Abell.\r\n It is estimated to be about 2,000 light years away.\r\n\r\nThis picture is the result of my longest integration time up to today,  it's more than 90 hours of frame capture during the past 3 years.\r\n\r\nThe work desk was complicated due the different scopes and cameras used and the low signal captured.",
