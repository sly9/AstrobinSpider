    "description": "Pickerings Triangle, the lesser photographed part of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. It actually has no NGC classification number, although NGC 6979 is sometimes used. This portion of the Cygnus loop was discovered in 1904 by Willamina Fleming, but credited to Edward Pickering, the director of her observatory. This was customary back in that time. \r\n\r\nI tried this object last year but was not happy with the data as my timing and clear skies happen to occur during some extremely hot and smoky filled(forest fires) days. This year, the skies cooperated and was able to capture some decent data.\r\n\r\nStill cant beat the Halos with the OIII filter unfortunately, but I don't think its to distracting in this image. Let me know what you think, always looking to improve!\r\n\r\nCS\r\nDan.",
