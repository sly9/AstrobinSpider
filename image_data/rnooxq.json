    "description": "From Wikipedia: \"NGC 5907 (also known as Knife Edge Galaxy or Splinter Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy located approximately 50 million light years from Earth.[2] It has an anomalously low metallicity and few detectable giant stars, being apparently composed almost entirely of dwarf stars.[3] It is a member of the NGC 5866 Group.\r\n\r\nNGC 5907 has long been considered a prototypical example of a warped spiral in relative isolation. In 2006, an international team of astronomers announced the presence of an extended tidal stream surrounding the galaxy that challenges this picture and suggests the gravitational perturbations induced by the stream progenitor may be the cause for the warp.\r\n\r\nThe galaxy was discovered in 1788 by William Herschel. Supernova 1940A was in this galaxy.\"\r\n\r\nSteve and I were pleased to have discovered that we had captured the faintest trace of the extended tidal stream with a glimmer of one of the loops.  Subsequently we imaged some longer 1200s luminance subs however this extra data has not added anything further of the very faint streams.  Hats off to the team who discovered the full extent of these streams . . . maybe a dark sky with a patient team and a light bucket can produce a more worthy attempt ;-)  CS!\r\n\r\nThanks to Steve - I had somehow misaligned the loop data from the 1200s subs in my boosted revised lum master and which I thought was the hint of a second loop.  Now corrected in rev B.  Just to be clear, Steve and I only found the faintest evidence of a single loop . . . wish we had found the rest though :-)\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
