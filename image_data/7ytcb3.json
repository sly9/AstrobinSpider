    "description": "With a recently updated acquisition of Uranus, I have now produced what I think are improved images of all the planets, except Mars  and the Moon, this year. The Sun is also an older image, when there were actually some sunspots.\r\nA no I didn't acquire the Earth image :-D.\r\nThese are to a modified scale:\r\nThe inner planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon and Mars are all 20X their size relative to the Sun whilst the outer planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are all 5X their size relative to the Sun.\r\nEven though I have some nice false colour images, particularly for Venus, I choose to use all colour images except for the Sun, which is colorised to have a yellow hue for aesthetic reasons. Of course, it really should be white.",
