    "description": "Click and zoom in to enjoy the lunar features in high resolution, Our Natural Satellite is around 4.5 billion years old, moon's surface has many features, including Mountains, Valleys, Craters, and Maria, in this high-resolution image of the moon one can see all these features also by zooming into the image one can see the fine details of Rilles, Wrinkle ridges, Escarpments, Mountainous capes and Chain of craters. Visually the color of the moon is somewhat seen in shades of grey but due to the different mineral composition, one can bring out the true colors in post-processing, blue and orange shades indicate volcanic lava flows, the dark blues indicate that those areas are richer in titanium-bearing minerals., pink colors indicate iron-poor, aluminum-rich minerals that make up the lunar highlands. Orange and purple indicate regions that are relatively poor in titanium and iron.\nThis image is a Mosaic of 19 separate panels each was stacked with 2500 frames and stitched together and enhanced the actual colors on the moon.",
