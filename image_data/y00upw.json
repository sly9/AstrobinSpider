    "description": "This is the first image where removed the stars with StarNet during processing to further enhance the nebulosity and I think it worked quite well. \r\nHowever I'm really not satisfied with how the color of the nebula turned out. I suspect the light polution suppression filter I'm using is causing the pinkish red of Hydrogen to be shifted towards a more orange-red. At least in other images without it Hydrogen was always nice and pink. I will try and use my IR/UV-cut filter instead of the LPS for the next emission nebula and see how it turnes out.",
