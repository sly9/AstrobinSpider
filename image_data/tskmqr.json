    "description": "Comet C/2010 Y4 at April 10, 2020 from my backyard.\r\n\r\nOkay, i f***cked it up.\r\nDuring comet alignment, i thought the comet must have changed his trajectory over the session. So i aligned each color channel separately, which resulted in lateral offsets between the channels in the comet stacks. I realigned them manually as good as i could. But the remaining misalignment - together with the moon which showed up during the session - causes color artifacts, still visible in the final image. \r\n\r\nLater i found, i additionally opened subs from pre-registration, they caused the \"curve\". But i was too lazy to start over from the beginning.",
