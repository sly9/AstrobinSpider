    "description": "A fun target, surprisingly difficult to get it done in SHO! Lot of haziness added with the Oiii data, struggled to make it not look like a blur, while also not removing too much of how it truly exists. This is the 5th revision of the data, think I can finally call it done (or at least acceptable for sharing!)\r\n\r\nYou can actually see one of these older revisions on my Instagram, but figured that was a bit too rainbowy for my tastes :)",
