    "description": "This image was taken through a remote set up at 'Image The Universe Remote Telescopes, Fregenal de la Sierra, Extremadura, Spain', e-Eye, from where my data will now come from. I have simply reached a point where due to the weather, poor skies, chronic light pollution and time constraints here in the UK, my 'hands on' imaging will be much less - and I am tired of fighting for the slightest opportunity. The data provided by ITU is superb, as well as being under perfect consistent skies. I just want to provide the sorts of images I might be able to, if I lived in a place such as this! I will miss some of the aspects of my back garden work...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe image consists of 20 subs at 20 minutes each in Ha, SII and OIII. Integration time 20 hours, all taken through a Borg 125 SD (5\" refractor) and using a QSI 683 WSG CCD camera and Astronomik filters. It is my first ever fully narrowband picture!",
