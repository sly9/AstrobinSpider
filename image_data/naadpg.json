    "description": "About 12,000 light years away, in the constellation Canis Major, is an emission nebula popularly known as Thor’s Helmet. The center of the nebula is roughly spherical, with extending filamentous structures of gas and dust that may have been the result of interaction with a nearby molecular cloud. In the middle of the object is the Wolf-Raynet star, WR7, a very hot star that may be nearing supernova. \r\n\r\nIt was a slog to gather enough data to make this image. Frequent overcast, fog, and poor seeing, coupled with this object’s location low on the horizon, resulted in many short (2-3 hours) unproductive data gathering sessions. All together I was only able to collected about 30 hours of data over a two month stretch. Of those data, I used about 13 hours (with HFR <3.0) for color mapping, and 8.4 hours of better quality data (HFR <2.6) to create a master luminance. Version F is an HOO rendition where I used a color palette that better reveals the gradients in OIII and Ha mixtures. The second rendition, Version B, use a more traditional HOO color palette.",
