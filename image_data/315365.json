    "description": "I’m betting I’m the only astrophotographer who has ever tried HFG1 before giving M31 or M45 a shot. Anyway, after having concentrated on a couple of galaxies, I wanted to do a really challenging narrowband image, but this was even more challenging than I was expecting. I’ve been wanting to do HFG1 since I first saw Stephane Zoll’s version, which brought me to Nico Geisler and Frank Iwaszkiewicz’s absolute masterpiece of this duo. Even with more integration time, I couldn’t approach the detail or luminosity they were able to achieve. I'm starting to realize why people spend so much on those 3 nm Astrodons... I’m going to have at least a week of cloudy nights ahead – I might try downloading Astro Pixel Processor and seeing if it can help me bring out more detail and keep down the noise.",
