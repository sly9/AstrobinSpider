    "description": "The Andromeda galaxy, our Milky Way's closest neighbor, is the most distant object in the sky that you can see with your unaided eye — but only on a clear night from a location with a very dark sky. The galaxy is a beautiful sprial, but one fact you may not be aware of: We’re safe for a few billion years, but Andromeda is headed our way and on a collision course with the Milky Way. Here we explain that cosmic train wreck, plus explain Andromeda's location, shape and other facts.\r\n\r\n",
