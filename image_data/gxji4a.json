    "description": "Crescent nebula looks more like a brain to me, a brain structure surrounded by blue nerves.  It is not an easy target with so much details  and lot of gas around.  Not to mention how faint the O3 signal is.  I shot it over two months because of weather and issues with my Moravian 16200.  The first  issue was that I accidentally  blew out the fuse and shortcut a zenner diode on power board. After I fixed it and completed the session,  the mechanical shutter blade fell off:-)   \r\nThis is my second try on NGC 6888. This time I shot it with much longer subs. That's a big advantage  with CCD camera. \r\n\r\nNights:\r\n6/18/2020, 6/26/2020, 6/27/2020, 7/3/2020, 7/4/2020/, 7/9/2020, 7/24/2020, 7/25/2020, 7/30/2020\r\n\r\nSubs:\r\nHa: 17x1800s\r\nO3: 18x1800s\r\nS2: 14x1800s\r\nR/G/B: 30x120s",
