    "description": "Sharpless 2-112 emission nebula lies approximately 5,500 light years away within the constellation of Cygnus – nearby to the bright star Deneb. The nebula’s H-alpha emissions are stimulated by the mag. +9.2 star BD+45 3216 a little to the right of the nebula´s center. The north-western side of the nebula is separated by a dark band of dust. There is abundant Ha nebulosity surrounding Sh2-112 together with several dark dust clouds.    \r\n\r\nThe image comprises a combination of Ha, [OIII] and RGB frames taken between 2017 and 2020 during seven different nights - almost 30 hours of exposure from the center of Vienna.\r\n\r\nH-alpha only:\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/48c3x6/D/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/48c3x6/D/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
