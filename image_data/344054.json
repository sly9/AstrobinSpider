    "description": "This is a two frame mosaic, taken mostly on Maunakea.\r\n\r\nMy earlier attempt on this subject can be found here:\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/120256/?nc=user\r\nI didn't like it.  So I took it again using a different camera.  The new version is indeed better, thanks to the higher sensitivity of the camera, and probably better processing too.\r\n\r\nVer.B is a reprocessing made in 2020, particularly with the help of Starnet++.\r\n\r\n(The plate-solved overlay seems way off.)",
