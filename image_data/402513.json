    "description": "This nightscape was done with a two-frame mosaic of the sky and one frame of the landscape. Each of the sky frames was a stack of 54 exposures of 120\" @ f/4, ISO 1600 with a Canon 50mm f/1.4 lens on a Canon 5DS R, which was mounted on a Fornax LighTrack II. The single land shot was done during blue hour with a Samyang 135mm f/2. The camera was set at ISO 125 for the foreground only.",
