    "description": "This image covers the area of nebulosity surrounding the star Eta Carina and is generally known as the Eta Carina Nebula (NGC3372). At the top right of the image is the Gabriela Mistral Nebula (IC2599) so named due to the resemblance to the Chilean Poet. NGC3372 makes for a stunning vista with the tendrils and swirls of nebulosity spread throughout this relatively wide field image.\r\n\r\nThe narrowband imaging technique applied to this project was to capture data with the Ha, OIII and SII filters. The filters used with this camera are the Astronomik 6nm 50mm round filters, providing a reasonably tight bandwidth window for capturing the narrowband data. Data processing was completed using the Pixinsight software with some minor adjustments in Photoshop CC.\r\n\r\nI have also included a starless version in Revision A (Original). Starless versions of narrowband nebula images can present an alternative view of the detail contained in the nebulosity that may not otherwise be apparent. They can make for quite striking and beautiful images.",
