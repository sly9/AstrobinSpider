    "description": "The commonly named Oyster Nebula, NGC1501, is a very small but very bright PN where you need to do very short exposures of RGB to not blow it out.  Here I used 10 second exposures, which were way more than needed.  Even with those I had to tone down the intensity of this image from the basic RGB result.  This is a very easy PN to do, and has a very interesting mottled appearance and a very strong teal color.  Oyster is 0.9 arc minutes in diameter, and lists as magnitude 13.  I think it much brighter than that.\r\n\r\nWikipedia says this:\r\nNGC 1501 is a complex planetary nebula located in the constellation of Camelopardalis, discovered in 1787 by William Herschel. It is also known as the Oyster Nebula.",
