    "description": "Looking for a warmer place to rent a home for a while, I naturally started with the Bortle maps!  We ended up choosing a community outside of Sedona Arizona.  This was a Bortle 3 location - which is pretty dark - but then I ended up shooting narrowband!  I've had the Spaghetti Nebula on my list for a long time and, being a Winter object, it's not accessible from Portland.  So NB it is.\r\n\r\nAs large as the FOV is on the QHY600M/FSQ106 combo, 240 is still far too big.  So this required a two panel mosaic to shoehorn in.  \r\n\r\nWe ended up getting some cloudy nights so this doesn't include as much data as I would like, but still a respectable 23.8 split across the two panels.  Twice as much would be better.\r\n\r\nThe mix is straight HOO.  Because these SNRs tend to have very different Ha and OIII components, I was not able to rely on the Ha for Luminance.  The resulting Cyans have been shifted slightly to the blue.  \r\n\r\nNoise reduction was with Topaz Denoise 5.1.  I added a touch of Topaz AI at the end, masking off all but the shadows.",
