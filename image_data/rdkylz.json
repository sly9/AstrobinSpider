    "description": "First image from Chile! Have some data for an LRGB image, but this one has always been a dream to do in SHO so I had to do it first! Definitely happy with the overall look of this image as well, most of the time I end up iffy on my SHO images by the end. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to many more. awesome images coming out of this scope.",
