    "description": "A joint discovery with expert galactic prospector Dana Patchick. This is the first ever image taken. It is believed to be a possible planetary nebula, but getting confirmation of this via spectroscopy is going to be challenging as it is so faint. Capturing this required almost 60 hours of data shot at bin 4x4.  Processing was problematic in terms of separating the nebula from faint gradients. Luckily my two scopes are oriented 180 degrees from each other to avoid the cameras colliding during autofocus.  This made it possible to detect the gradients by processing the data from each scope separately and then comparing the two images. Background subtraction was used to stretch the faint signal before re-adding the background.",
