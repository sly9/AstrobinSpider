    "description": "This is a bicolor of the Medusa Nebula aka Sh2-274, plus star color by RGB. This is also my first image with my new ASI 2600MMPro. I think that I will be quite happy with this new camera. The 16bit ADC, increased full well capacity and efficiency seem to make it a better camera than the 1600 which was already a really good camera. I am eager to explore more ...\r\n\r\nWorkflow has changed recently as I have found the star less approach to cause some artefacts that I did not like. Now I work on the original narrowband images and use Starnet only to obtain a good star mask. Star color is blended in a later stage - still experimenting here.\r\n\r\nI hope for a few more clear nights soon ...\r\n\r\nCS\r\nVolker",
