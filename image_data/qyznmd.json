    "description": "NGC 266 is a barred galaxy right on the border of Andromeda and Pisces. In fact sources list it in either of the two constellations. It was discovered by William Herschel on September 12, 1784. It is probably 200 million light-years distant and classified as SB(rs)ab with LINER-type galactic nucleus. It is a large impressive galaxy, likely some 180,000 light-years or more across.",
