    "description": "For reasons that have not yet been determined NGC 6357 is forming some of the most massive stars ever found. NGC 6357 contains the open star cluster Pismis 24, home to these tremendously bright and blue stars. The overall red glow near the inner star forming region results from the emission of ionized hydrogen gas.\nImaged in SHO Narrowband, on our  RiDK 400 remote telescope at El Sauce,  Chile.\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\nSystem Control Software:  Voyager  by Leonardo Orazi",
