    "description": "When we started to edit this data, little would we know what we were about to start. Out of curiosity, I tried getting detail from the core. This revealed a surprising structure, a barred shape.  First confirming that this was not an artifact, I asked my astrophysics professor Reinout van Weeren, who actively studies extragalactic objects, what this structure was. He found that this structure had been resolved by Hubble in 1985, and it was a dustlane that ran right through the core. It is quite unusual to see this structure in an amateur image!",
