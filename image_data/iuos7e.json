    "description": "Here I show you another breathtaking photo of our Lofoten trip. We were lucky because there was a lot of aurora activity.\r\n\r\nIn the picture you can see the mountain \"Olstinden\" above which a mighty polar light has formed. It looked like a giant eye ... It seemed like green waves were pounding from the center to the edges.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to describe but it was reverent :)\r\n\r\nForeground: 10 sec. / f2.8 / ISO 3200\r\nSky: 8 sec. / f2.8 / ISO 2500\r\n\r\nCS\r\n\r\nGernot",
