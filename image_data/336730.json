    "description": "First Liverpool Telescope data that I processed this year. Data is from 20150329-20170504 taken with the Bessell V, Bessell B, sdss-r and sdss-g filters. \r\n\r\nI have not seen many other good images of this galaxy from earth-bound scopes, with the notable exception of one from Adam Block. This is a 2 m f/10 RC scope = a focal length of 20 meters. So for most telescopes this will be a very small galaxy.",
