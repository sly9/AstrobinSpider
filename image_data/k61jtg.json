That motion, plus the usual  fast and slow wind components of the interstellar media have affected the geometry of this nebula (Wareing, C., et al., 2004). The  leading edge (at 4:00) suffers a bow-shock as from the nebula’s interaction with the winds. Presumably, the faint “tail” of the nebula consists of gases left behind or blown of the trailing edge as the bulk of the nebula moves rapidly onward.\r\n\r\nThe fast-moving central star (now a white dwarf) is marginally visible in this narrowband image (with a great deal of zoom); it lies close to the small blue star just inside the lower-right part of the bubble. It is this central star, with the assistance of the shock wave, that ionizes the gases of its planetary nebula.",
