    "description": "NGC4038 and NGC4039 - The Antennae Galaxies form a beautiful pair of interacting galaxies that are 45 million light years from Earth at a declination of -18Â° 52'.  Around 1.2 billion years ago, NGC4038, a barred spiral galaxy, and NGC4039, a spiral galaxy, were independently going about their business.  Around 900 million years ago, they got too close to each other, and their respective gravity pulled the two of them together.  It is believed they passed through each other 600 million years ago. In this violent collision stars form and explode and the galaxies are completely remade.  300 million years later stars and dust from both galaxies start to be ejected into intergalactic space, forming the two streams that look like antennae, giving the pair their nickname.  In approximately 400 million years from now the two nuclei will merge and will likely result in a single, large elliptical galaxy. \r\n\r\nAlso shown in the lower right corner is NGC 4027.  This barred spiral galaxy is oddly shaped, with one of its arms being pulled away from the core, indicating that it, too had a collision with another galaxy in its past.  It lies 85 million light years from Earth, another 40 million ly away from the Antennae galaxies.",
