    "description": "My next visit to Ziołowy Zakątek, a unique botanical garden in the heart of Podlasie. The Milky Way, that is the summer part of our galaxy, and in the foreground the historic Church of Our Lady of Berries. The summer part of the Milky Way is the most expressive part of the northern sky. On the other hand, the Church of Our Lady of Jagoda was moved from Grodzisk in 2015, which was then the parish church. Currently restored and blended into the beauty of the nature of the local garden. Something amazing that is worth seeing. It was my second visit to this place and certainly not the last. The photo shows the Milky Way with the constellation Swan. \r\n\r\n22.07.2020 Koryciny, Podlasie, POLAND\r\n\r\nCanon EOS R mod plus Sigma 28mm f1.4mm ART \r\n16 x Pano 15s ISO3200 f1.8",
