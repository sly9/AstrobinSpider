    "description": "Three panel Mosaic featuring RCW114 in HaRGB, from Melbourne.\r\n\r\nThis huge but very faint nebula has rarely if ever photographed by amateurs. \r\nLooks a bit like Indiana Jones'whip :)\r\n\r\nIt was originally thought to be a ring nebula surrounding the Wolf-Rayet star WR 90, expanding into a pre-existing cavity created by the supernova remnant 343.0-06.0. However, current research suggests that is much closer to us than WR90, so is an Ancient SNR in it's own right.\r\n\r\nIt's big (and dim) too, this is now 1/2 of the region in the FOV! \r\nFor the curious it's located next to Sargas in Scorpius, 345.07, -6.445 \r\nThe Glob at the upper left is NGC 6388\r\n\r\n27 hrs - 54 x1800sec subs - Ha3nm \r\n11.5 hrs - 69x600sec subs RG&B\r\n\r\nTaken from my light polluted suburban backyard in Melbourne, Australia.",
