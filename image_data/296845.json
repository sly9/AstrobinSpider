    "description": "Saturn and Titan!\r\nMy best record this year of the Lord of the Rings.\r\nNearly perfect Cassini division, Encke's slightly visible division and C ring though tenuous, in the correct coloring that is a steel blue. Many bands visible as well as the hexagonal hurricane and even its dark black tone kernels.\r\nTitan was captured and processed separately, the assembly was made to make the photo more interesting. I tried to put it in the correct position in relation to the planet but they are disproportionate in size since for Saturn was used a resize of 140% and for Titan a resize of 200%.\r\nBetween the two catches there is an interval of 13 minutes.\r\nHttp://www.astrobin.com/full/296845/0/?nc=astroavani&real=&mod=",
