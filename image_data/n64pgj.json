    "description": "I have taken the focal reducer out of my imaging train that I would normally use and reverted back to the native 2000mm FL of the 10\"RC.  Perhaps that is why the color needed quite a bit of stretching especially in the spiral arms.  I have brought out some of the gaseous disk that extends beyond the galaxies bright optical disk but there is definitely more there than is captured in my image.  Perhaps in  following years I can add to the exposure to bring out more of the gaseous disk but it will be difficult in my Bortle 5-6 skies.",
