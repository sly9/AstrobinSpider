    "description": "It was a challenging day.  Seeing conditions were not ideal.  Out of 167 video files captured, I only managed to keep 123 - and I could have tossed out more, but then the smoothness of the animation really would have suffered.\r\n\r\nThis animation is running at 32 frames per second and packs 1 hour and 6 minutes of sun activity into 3.84 seconds, running in forward and reverse motion.",
