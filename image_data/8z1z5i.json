    "description": "This is the second object from that night. I chose it because it was on the opposite side of the moon. It's not very famous, it has no name and I can't think of one either. But I like it, definitely an interesting area with a lot going on.\r\nNext time I'll start with the galaxy season.ðŸ™‚",
