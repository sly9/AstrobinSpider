    "description": "This project has been another long-held ambition for me and has been a labour of love over the past few weeks for Steve and I on our shared rig in Spain.  We alternate over three weeks the duties of controlling and operating the rig and the capture programme and have both shared the joy and frustration of the winter weather - yes even in Spain.  I've been intrigued by NGC1999 and its 'keyhole' along with the faint blue reflection nebula that surround the main attractions or M42, 43 and the Running Man and am delighted to have stitched together this four panel mosaic to show their relative positions.\r\n\r\nProcessing has taken as long as the total integration, circa 40 hours, and I can foresee us adding to this data next year.  There is a tiny amount of data to capture to help the mosaic in a couple of places and we hope to be able to do this when the weather clears and at the next New Moon.\r\n\r\nEach panel has 13 x 1200s Ha; 12 x 300s + 15 x 180s + 30 x 30s Lum; 12 x 300s of RGB each.  A total integration of 37.3 hrs.  Tak 106, 10 Micron GM1000HPS, QSI683wsg-8, Astrodon filters, SGP for capture and PI for processing, e-Eye, Spain.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson.\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy.",
