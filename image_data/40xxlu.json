    "description": "My first attempt on IC 63 and like many others i struggeled with Gamma Cassiopeia. The reflection is really heavy, the form a little bit unusual and the large scale diffraction patterns pointing to a not so perfect collimation. I tried to process or clone the reflection away, but was not successfull at this task. On the other hand I am happy with this result from a bortle 5 sky and limited exposure time.",
