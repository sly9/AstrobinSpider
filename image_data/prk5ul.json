    "description": "This is my longest project so far. The O3 and S2 signal was really faint, so I think I made a good decision with this long exposure, especially from my Bortle 8 zone. I had to throw 7h worth of subs due to clouds and guiding issues. I also added the RGB stars.\r\n\r\nIt is a faint emission nebula situated in Cepheus. It is located around 10000 ly away and it contains Wolf-Rayet stars, massive, evolved and luminous stars . \r\n\r\nAcquisition from August 24 to September 13 :\r\n \r\nHa 143 x 300s\r\nO3 130 x 300s\r\nS2 112 x 300s\r\nRGB 3 x 60 x 60 s\r\nTotal : 33,5 h.",
