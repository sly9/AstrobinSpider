Abell36 is a fairly large  PN, measuring 6.2 arc minutes and has a magnitude listed at 12. It shows some on the RGB image. The magnitude is listed as 11.8, both the Ha and Oiii are fairly strong, and each has its own unique distribution.  It has a very interesting interwoven appearance.\r\n\r\nIts central progenitor star is exceptionally large and bright blue, very unusual.\r\nIt is located 780 light years away in the constellation of Virgo.\r\n\r\nMy Abell Collection is here:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\nCurrently 60+, and soon to be complete.",
