    "description": "With this image my challenge was to deal with a very bright core while still presenting the dimmer, outer gasses and how to blend the SHO data to get representation for all of the colors.  \r\n\r\nI pre-stretched each channel master leaving the background quite bright and the highlights at .95.  Then combined the now non-linear masters using the excellent dynamic NB combination method described here: https://thecoldestnights.com/2020/06/pixinsight-dynamic-narrowband-combinations-with-pixelmath/\r\n\r\nThis method uses the OIII channel to determine how much Ha, SII, and OIII to blend for Red and Green at a pixel level.  The basic formula the author describes worked well for me.  That is:\r\n\r\nWhere f = OIII\r\nRed:       f*SII + ~f*Ha\r\nGreen:   f*(.7*SII+.3*Ha) + ~ f*OIII\r\nBlue:      OIII\r\n\r\nAfter that combination was used, I ran a fairly light application of HDRMT to tame the core.  This was followed with Starnet++ and PS clean-up to produce a starless. \r\n\r\nNoise reduction was applied to the starless image with the PS reduce Noise for the mid-tones and shadows.  Highlights received Topaz noise reduction with sharpening turned off and opacity at 85%.  \r\n\r\nUnsharp masking was use to add sharpening at a 4 pixel span and contrast at a 48 pixel span.\r\n\r\nStars were then added back in and a minimum filter used to reduce them a bit.  \r\n\r\nColors were enhanced with the PS vibrance tool, curves in the LAB mode and the final touch of color balance.",
