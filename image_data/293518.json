    "description": "Even when we are travelling we are looking to the skies... :-) Lenticular Clouds here...\r\n\r\nAfter couple of days I could saw some news about that:\r\n\r\n\"Clouds with 'mysterious format' caught the eye in the region's sky this morning (26). Experts say the phenomenon is common in mountainous regions.\r\nThe clouds were seen by residents of São José dos Campos, Jacareí, Jambeiro and Pindamonhangaba. The phenomenon generated curiosity.\r\nAccording to experts from the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies (Cptec), clouds are called lenticular and, despite calling attention, are common in mountainous regions, such as the Paraíba Valley.\" ( local papers news )...\r\n\r\nSorry for the crappy low resolution cellular camera and for the weird long name of my city !!! :-) I had never seen before this kind of clouds so...its a very different kind of cloud... (BTW, lot of clouds .....thats what Im seeing these days here ....)  :-) hope you enjoy !",
