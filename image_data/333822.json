    "description": "On my website I have this image in the \"Unreal Reality\" category. To me this means something that represents reality but could not be captured in a single image or with a single instrument.\r\n\r\nThe background sky image was captured (multiple combined images) with a Canon 5D Mark III DSLR mounted piggyback on my Paramount ME.  The image of the thunderstorm on the horizon was made  with the same camera on a tripod in my driveway and was composited from about 5 10 second images  (out of maybe 50 I took of the storm) so as to capture the thunderstorm cloud and lightning on the horizon. The horizon profile image also came from these shots since the camera was fixed. The two parts were captured on different nights although the local sky was clear above the thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nOverall I think it represents what your eye would see if it had the sensitivity to do so.",
