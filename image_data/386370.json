    "description": "Statue of Liberty Nebula in Narrowband HOO&SHO\r\nHOO: Original revision and B \r\nSHO:  Revision C\r\nH-alpha: 6×300s  O-III: 9×300s  S-II: 3×300s\r\nMe and one of my friend together rent Chilescope 1m RC to image this spectacular region. We were so excited when we got the frames and I was shocked when I finished the process-so many details and such amazing shape with so many dark filaments around it! This region looks like Statue of Liberty flying in the sky, or a warrior is about to kill the crocodile around his belt. Hope you like the image:)",
