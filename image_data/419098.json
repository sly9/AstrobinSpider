    "description": "This is an \"All-Backyard\" project - all data from my bortle class 9 backyard under the moon, including Ha, S-II, O-III and R/G/B star layers. It took 7 nights to collect all the data for this project. It's quite unusual - one whole week with clear night sky. Right after I failed miserably trying to capture some data for the SH2-129/Ou4. Now I do admit that some targets are not practical for backyarders. \r\n\r\nLearned quite a lot from imaging and processing the RGB stars. Intentionally, the stars are decreased a lot to expose more nebulosity. Three versions are made and uploaded - star spikes, no spikes and no stars. Don't know why one is better. \r\n\r\n<B><I>Comments are welcome! </I></B>\r\n<I>Thinking about Western Veil as the next target. </I>\r\n\r\n<I><B>Pre-processing of Narrowband Masters</B></I>\r\n\r\n- Calibration / Integration, Astro Pixel Processor\r\n- Deconvolution, PixInsight (Only for H-Alpha)\r\n- MultiscaleLinearTransformation (Denoise), PixInsight\r\n- ScreenTransferFunction / HistogramTransformation, PixInsight.\r\n\r\n<B><I>Pre-processing of RGB Masters</I></B>\r\n\r\n- Calibration / Integration, Astro Pixel Processor\r\n- Dynamic Background Extraction, PixInsight\r\n- MorphologicalTransformation, PixInsight\r\n- ScreenTransferFunction / HistogramTransformation, PixInsight.\r\n\r\n<I><B>RGB Combination</B></I>\r\n\r\n- LRGBCombination, PixInsight\r\n- MorphologicalTransformation, PixInsight\r\n- ScreenTransferFunction / HistogramTransformation, PixInsight.\r\n\r\n<I><B>Narrowband Combination</B></I>\r\n\r\n- PixelMath, PixInsight\r\n- ScreenTransferFunction / HistogramTransformation, PixInsight.\r\n\r\n<I><B>Narrband & RGB Combination</B></I>\r\n- Star adjustment, Lightroom\r\n- Final Touch-up, Photoshop",
