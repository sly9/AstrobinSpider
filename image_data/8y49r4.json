    "description": "Bruce Waddington began astro-imaging 15 years ago and has been using QSI Cameras since 2013. Bruce also spends plenty of time writing free software for astro-imaging including heavy involvement in the PHD2 open source telescope guiding software project.\r\n\r\nThe Cat’s Eye image was a major challenge for me and I started to think of it as “the target from hell.”  The difficulty is the huge dynamic range of the object – the core has an apparent visual magnitude of 8 with a very high surface brightness,  but the outer extensions are very faint.  So I had to approach it almost as two separate targets.  The core needed exposure times of 1-2 minutes to avoid saturation while the outer nebula extensions needed the 10-minute exposures I normally use for deep-sky targets.  To make matters harder, it’s a summertime target in the northerm hemisphere which coincides with the annual monsoon season at my observing site in New Mexico.  Consequently, I collected data during 9 nights spread across two years, 2019 and 2020.  The final integration has 220 minutes of LRGB, Hydrogen-alpha, and Oxygen-3 for the core; and another 15 hours of LRGB for the outer nebula areas.  Creating a composite image that looked natural and still retained all the structural and color detail was equally challenging, and I would estimate I spent another 20 hours doing that.  Post-processing was done with CCDStack, PixInsight, and Photoshop CS5.   All of the imaging was done from my installation at SkyPi Remote observatories in New Mexico using a Planewave 12.5” telescope and my QSI-640ws camera working at f/8.",
