    "description": "Here's the SHO version. Tonight there was just enough clear sky to gather some reasonable SII data despite marginal seeing. Shooting with a reducer on this scope makes processing more complicated, with vignetting and a host of other issues. I am swapping the FLI out for a smaller chip, still grade 1, which is better matched to the image circle the reducer throws on this 8RC. Moving te FLI over to the 132 for now.",
