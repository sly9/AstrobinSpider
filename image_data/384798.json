    "description": "This area for sure gets a lot of attention by astro photographers. Like many, I attempted to feature these objects as one of my first targets. Now, some 4 years later, the time has come to see if I can do any better.\r\n\r\nI would have loved to add more HA to the picture, but the weather conditions this winter have been nearly as bad as last year and so I have to work with what I have got.\r\n\r\nThis was the first picture I did with APT and PHD2.",
