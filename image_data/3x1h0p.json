    "description": "Kn61 was given to me as a challenge by <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/users/Pat_Rodgers/>Pat Rogers</a> after we had both done Fe6 and had a short discussion about what our most difficult targets had been up to that point. He said his was <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/296347/>Kronberger 61</a>. Yeah, this one was brutal. Insanely faint and with a very delicate structure - it was an extremely difficult target on several levels. I sat on these data for months because I just couldn't get anything I was satisfied with (I also messed up my capture and had red running instead of blue once). I started and stopped processing it several times, and each attempt barely looked any different from the previous one. I'm still a little dissatisfied, but the data I have are the data I have and I can't squeeze any more of them. I don't think I'd try this one again unless I can get a scope at least 12\" in diameter or could image it from somewhere significantly higher in elevation than my usual ~90 m above sea level. You should definitely check out the images from the <a href=https://www.gemini.edu/node/11656>Gemini Observatory</a> (twin 8 meter scopes at high elevation) and the <a href=http://www.capella-observatory.com/ImageHTMLs/PNs/Kn61.htm>Capella Observatory</a> (12.9 meter scope) to see what this target really looks like - my 0.2 meter scope (and imaging conditions) are simply no match.",
