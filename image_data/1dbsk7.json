    "description": "A fun processing challenge with my friend Tim Hutchison after discussing the various types of narrowband combinations and ways to go about it. Even though we both took similar approaches to combination, it is very fun to see how different our final images ended up being.\r\n\r\nYou can check his out here: https://www.astrobin.com/fbzok7/\r\n\r\nI tend to go for a (roughly) gold and cyan color scheme, so this definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone- but I ended up loving the end result. Will probably add this to my regimen for processing SHO images from now on, or at least try a combination like this to see if I am liking the way the colors look.",
