    "description": "This material was gathered in May,  weather was ugly all month but I found 20 lucky hours to shoot this popular target but at bit less popular scale.\nMy RC12 with ASI 2600MC gives scale 0,31 so I decided to go for BIN2 as the dust usually does not bring taht many detail. Well, it quite did.\nI live in the suburbs of big town, but I decided not to use my anti LP filter (IDAS LP D2), as it gives sometimes halos and here central star is quite bright.,",
