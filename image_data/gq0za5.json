    "description": "A pearl of the southern sky with dark shapes and brilliant outlines that cross the dusty NGC6188 spanning decades of light years. This emitting nebula is near the edge of a large, usually dark molecular cloud in the southern constellation of Ara, about 4,000 light-years away.\r\nLower right, the dragon's egg or the NGC6164 nebula is a bipolar emission type ejected by a Wolf Rayet star located 3,910 light years away. This composition was made with a mosaic of 4 panels and totaling 70 hours of exposure  during Jully and mid-August.",
