    "description": "This image was made with the use of 100 frames for the Light-side and 100 frames for the earth-shine. The images were aligned and stacked in photoshop and then blended together to show the entire moon. The colours are a little over saturated to show the mineral composition of the moon. I also flipped this Image to how it is seen in the northern hemisphere compared to what I see in the southern hemisphere.",
