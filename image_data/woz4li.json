    "description": "This may seem redundant to many, but there is a reason.  I have seen a few really good M33s lately, and all of the good ones have a characteristic that mine lacked (or shall I say they didn't have a characteristic that mine did)...that is saturation.  So common are galaxies, M33 included, portrayed with saturation boosts and bright colors.  My previous M33 is a prime example.  I tried to tame it--and by version Z was getting somewhere--but enough was enough.  I decided to reprocess and am proud to say that I did not touch saturation--not once did I give it a boost.  The only saturation in this image comes from the original mix, with curve adjustments to brightness to increase dynamic range.  Such adjustments lesson brightness and tighten up the details, which tend to seemingly add color.  But that is only an illusion--the same chroma is present, its just that as I have said before, brightness hides details and color.    So here is a new version of M33 with the same data as my previous image, processed with a shackle on the vile enemy that is over saturation.  I suppose an argument could be made that the Ha is oversaturated or the image.  I only inserted 70% of the Ha, so I tried.  And the Ha regions were masked out for most of the brightness curves adjustments I mentioned --just to ensure saturation did not creep up.  This image is not reduced in size at all unlike the previous.\r\n\r\nSo--I wanted to put this M33 on its own page and intend to delete the version that the general consensus says is inferior.  Having it on its own page makes comparison a bit easier as far as other peoples opinion, which I value immensely (some would say to much--but writers don't write to the vacuum, or for themselves...well sometimes, but writers write for the enjoyment of others. \r\n So too photagraphers...at least me).  What do you think? Should I nudge the saturation up a bit---I have a few versions with small bumps, but I wanted to start off pure.",
