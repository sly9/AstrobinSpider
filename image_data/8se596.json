    "description": "I saw this beautiful galaxy for the first time when working with the <a href=\"https://data.galaxyzoo.org/\">Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset</a> for a college project. For this project I just needed low-res JPGs from SDSS so I went there to get some (reduced) plates try to compose a photo, but the resolution wasn't very good. I searched in other telescope archives but went with nothing, except for the Liverpool Telescope, that has some (not many) useable Bessell-B, Bessell-V, sdss-g and sdss-r fits. Although the resolution is not great anyway, I went ahead and finally assembled the sdds-r, V and B integrations into the RGB channels and made some processing to get the colors about right (tried photometric calibration but didn't get enough stars). \r\n\r\nI've not seen many images of this galaxy out there, Hope you like it. \r\n\r\nR: sdss-r  14x 120s\r\nG: Bessell-V 12x 30s \r\nB: Bessell-B 12x 30s \r\n\r\nCredit:\r\nLiverpool Telescope, http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/\r\nInstrument: IO:O\r\nProposals: NSO_Priority_1, NSO_Priority_2., NSO_Priority_3",
