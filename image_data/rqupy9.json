    "description": "The Iris nebula on the left is a bright reflection nebula in the constellation Cepheus and lies some 1300 light years away. Throughout the frame are dense dusty regions that block out the light of background stars. Some starlight still passes, but is more red in color. The preferential scattering of blue light allows the red light to pass through, in the same way sunsets are red, and our sky is blue. This also gives the Iris nebula its distinctive blue color near the bright star SAO 19158.\r\n\r\nThroughout the frame are additional dusty regions that stand out from the background including LDN1158 to the right.",
