    "description": "I photograph this region quite often and this time I got a nice clean image being a mosaic of two frames. This composition contains many interesting and characteristic formations. Mare Humorum and a wax seal in the north, Gassendi crater. Ditch complexes in the west: Rimae Mersenius, Rimae de Gasparis and Rimae Doppelmayer, in the east: Hippalus Rille and the crater with two \"faces\" - Hippalus. In the upper corner - Montes Riphaeus, a band of shock artifacts that have recently intrigued me. Below is a lava landscape with hill ranges.",
