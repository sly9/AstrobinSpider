    "description": "I was reading Rob Howley webpage on narrowband imaging http://www.almadenobservatory.net/Color_Imagery.html , very useful reading.  I took three images: Hydrogen-Red, Oxygen-Green, Nitrogen-Blue and stacked in Fitswork, received Version A (similar to Rob's image). But when I aligned the channels more or less equal - I got completely different color image - Version B. What is right and what it wrong? To leave the colors AS IS or align colors? What do you think, friends? I appreciate your comments. \r\n\r\nThinking about Nitrogen filter now, my mind is poisoned now by narrowband palettes :)))",
