    "description": "This image was created using the free luminance images from Deep Sky West and an image from the public data pool by Christopher Gomez.I processed it using PixInsight. Since the weather has been terrible around here I needed something to process. I haven't imaged the Horsehead for 2 years and the ones I tried to use for the RGB just didn't look very good, so thanks to Christopher Gomez for putting his in the data pool.",
