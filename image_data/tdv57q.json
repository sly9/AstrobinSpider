    "description": "Approximately 15 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra, the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy is one of the closest and brightest barred spiral galaxies in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe reddish nodes in the arms of the galaxy are regions of Hydrogen, diffuse gaseous nebulae, inside which the star formation is just starting, and whose light radiation is due to the gas ionized by some news very hot stars. The bluish regions correspond to a population of existing stars, but recently formed (that is to say between a few million and a few tens of millions of years).\r\n\r\nThis image is the composition of 335 poses totaling 30 hours of exposure. I am not sure that the last hours have had a very big impact on the main object but they help to soften the sky background and the general rendering.",
