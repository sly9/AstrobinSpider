    "description": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nfollows a new image of Mars taken at dawn last Friday with variable turbulence and good transparency! This is face of large volcanoes, region of Tharsis, where found two blains that randomly cut the surface of the planet, like tracks left by an eraser or something crawling .. for the latter that these “tracks” are popularly known as “worm tracks ”And it is not difficult to remember the giant worms in the book“ Dune ”. In reality these characteristics were made by the wind, landslides and collapse of lava tunnels that abounded between the 4 great volcanoes of the region: Monte Olympus, Monte Arsia, Monte do Pavão and Monte Ascraeus.",
