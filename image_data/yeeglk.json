    "description": "One of the two images I did with my new QHY178M camera, when I didn't manage to start imaging some exoplanet or do some EAA, so as a result I just imaged random targets, other being NGC7331. Ideally, for a good picture, I'd want 4 more times integration that I have gotten here, but this will do. I quite like how it's \"in your face\".  I also had some increadible guiding, especially for EQ6- whole night it was bouncing from 0.4-0.5\" RMS. Just crazy good stability.",
