    "description": "Another one from the Moon.  I played with changing the photographic region of interest in FireCapture as I wanted to try and get Tycho and Clavius in the same shot.   This is in the south region of the Moon.   As I understand it, Tycho is 85 km (~53 miles) across and â€Ž4.8 km (2.98 miles) deep and is the youngest of the large craters.   Maginus is larger at 194 km (~120 miles) across and 4.3 km (~2.67 miles) deep.   One of my favorite craters is at the bottom, Clavius measures about 225 km (140 miles) in diameter and 3.5 km (~2.1 miles) deep.   It was formed by an asteroid whose impact occurred about 4 billion years ago.    I'm particularly drawn to the five craters in a semi-circle on the inside.    Tycho, by the way, was where the Monolith was found in the movie \"2001\"!     Shot was taken July 12th with a CGE 11 using a QHY5III178M. Best 20% of 4000 frames were taken using FireCapture and stacked in Autostakkert 3, with processing in PS-CC.",
