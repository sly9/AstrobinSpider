    "description": "Although very photogenic and well placed for northern observers these two objects are rarely imaged: LBN 762 / MBM13 dubbed the Drunken Dragon Nebula can be seen in the lower half of the image with LBN 753 just above it. This 2.5deg field is located in Aries just south of MBM12.\r\nThis relatively young association of gas and dust is home to an early stellar nursery and a few newborn stars [McGehee 2008]. Once believed to be the nearest dust cloud from our solar system it is now suggested to be about 850 light-years away.\r\nThe structure of both LBN 762 and 753 are quite amazing and one must wonder what forces are at play to create such intricate features. Numerous background galaxies are visible, some even through relatively dense part of the translucent clouds. \r\n",
