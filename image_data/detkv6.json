    "description": "It is another faint object. I had to use stars to confirm my composition. A 1800 seconds sub could barely show the shape in O3. This nebula is dominated by O3 signal with some spots of Ha here and there.  As the picture shows, the gas has been blowing out through the mouth.  The lights traveled 4350 light years to reach earth to share this awesome shape to us. \r\n    From my location,  it only goes to 33 degree on heavy polluted south side , that gave me 3.5 hours windows per night with blocking tree and house. Luckily Texas winter gave us lots of clears long nights, I was able to finish this in 20 days together with two other objects.\r\n\r\nNights: \r\n12/17/2020, 12/19/2020, 12/20/2020, 12/24/2020, 12/25/2020, 12/26/2020, 1/2/2020, 1/4/2020, 1/8/2020\r\n\r\nSubs:\r\nha: 20x1800s\r\no3: 26x1800s\r\nr/g/b: 20x120s",
