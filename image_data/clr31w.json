    "description": "I reworked this image of Mars from 1st October, within a few days of closest approach. For this capture I had perhaps the best seeing of the entire apparition and a lovely aspect with Olympus Mons very prominent. The Tharsis shield volcanoes Arsia Mons to the south and Pavonis Mons are substantially covered by orographic clouds, whilst the prominent peak of Ascraeus Mons further north and more towards the limb is cloud free and with one flank in shadow. Despite being on the limb the detail of the Vallis Marineris can be readily discerned. Solis Lacus is also near the limb and about to rotate out of view.\r\nThe large albedo area to the south and central to the images is Mare Sirenum.\r\nOn the f side of the shield volcanoes are the vast plains of the Amazonis Planitia.\r\nBy this stage the South Polar Cap was much reduced and asymmetrically placed to the true south pole.",
