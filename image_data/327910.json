    "description": "Larger on the sky than M101, this is tricky because it's faint and because the FOV is dominated by bright field stars which need to be controlled. Colour balance is also difficult because of the reddening effects of the dense Milky Way through which we see it. Tom O'Donoghue used the Les Granges TEC140-Mesu200-Atik 460 rig to supervise most of the capture. This is my processing. LRGB, 15 hours altogether.\r\nIn the house 14 inch Meade SCT the only sign of this galaxy at the eyepmiece was the nucleus itself which looked like a blurred star, no more than that. It's remarkably faint, making it all the more fascinating as an object!",
