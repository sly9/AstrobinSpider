    "description": "I'm dialing in the setup one step at a time and hopefully improving my processing.  This one definitely allowed for a lighter touch in post and I think it shows in the end result.    \r\n\r\nThis will be my largest Mars for the year.   It's all downhill from here!    I cobbled this setup together just in time for opposition.   At this point, I'll consider it a mission accomplished.   Though I really think there is more capability hiding here.   I will need to keep at it.  I just hope I don't forget all I have learned as Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter slowly recede for the year.",
