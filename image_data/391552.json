    "description": "Reprocessed September 10 Mars captures with drizzle and WinJUPOS treatment. I think this is arguably my best effort to date from last year's opposition.. recording spanned 15 minutes at 146 captures per second with an average of 6.3% usable frames (~1500 per stack).\r\n\r\nI've derotated three 180 second AS!2 stacks in line with other days. Again, non-drizzle and drizzle versions are compared side by side. Capture midpoint is at 11:12 pm with sunset taking place at 5:51 pm local time.\r\n\r\nSinus Gomer and western portions of Mare Cimmerium exhibit some very dark albedos with the peak of Elysium Mons standing out in the south. Eridania and Mare Chronium are visible in high southern latitudes with a dark linear feature flanking the SPC. There's a hint of terminator projection at 8 and 2 o'clock for Nth and Sth up images respectively. Bright Aeolis and Zephyria regions show reasonable amount of fine detail despite <20 arc second disk.",
