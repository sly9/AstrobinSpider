It appears as a modest brightness making it one of the easier Sharpless catalog objects to view. It features an apparent central star inside the nebulosity however it is not part its system nor a left over remnant.\r\n\r\nThe nebulous area is fairly large with an irregular shape appearing as a 180° arc shape surrounding a central star. The remnant has an apparent diameter that covers approximately 150' and an estimated distance of approximately 650ly away. \r\n(Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nMy Collections:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae (Complete)</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2627/\" target=\"_new\">Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2626/\" target=\"_new\">Galaxies</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2625/\" target=\"_new\">Sharpless 2 Objects",
