    "description": "NGC 4753 is a lenticular galaxy located around 60 million light years from here in Virgo. It has a series of very distinct dust lanes around its nucleus.\nThe distribution of this dust in is in an inclined disk wrapped several times around the nucleus. The material in the disk may have been accreted from the merger of gas rich dwarf galaxy.\nAnother possible explanation is that the dust originated from red giant stars in the galaxy.\n\nImaged in LRGB on our CDK 1000 at El Sauce, Obstech, Chile\nImage Processing: Mike Selby",
