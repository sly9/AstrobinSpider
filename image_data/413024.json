    "description": "A very photogenic and popular nebula region filled with dynamic dark light-absorbing nebula in complex patterns along with very strong emission data, making it a magnet for every imager.  This two panel mosaic only shows a small portion of the fabulous region in Cygnus which spans over 100 light years.\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed the processing of the colourful Hubble palette and emphasised the gaseous structure by modifying the palette with selective colour masks.  Plenty of long subs helped bring a depth to the structure and detail.  Captured between 27 May and 28 June.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
