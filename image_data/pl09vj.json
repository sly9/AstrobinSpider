    "description": "Due to cloudy weather in Germany I am busy with processing training and reworking older data. When I went to my astroholiday last August to beautiful France, the lagoon nebula was on the top of my target list. There is no way to get it from my backyard because of a street lanterne. I imaged this stunning nebula always as the first object after sunset and got data in H alpha,OIII,SII,R,G and B. What you see here is a wild mix of all. Only RGB, seemed a little boring to me, so I decided for this of course a little special combination, from which I hope you like it.\r\n\r\nCS for all of you, Christoph",
