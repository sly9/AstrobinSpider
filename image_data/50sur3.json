    "description": "The blue filaments, cataloged as Sh2-96, are a small part of a larger Supernova Remnant (SNR) G65.3+5.7 located in the constellation Cygnus about 2500 light-years from Earth.  This image displays a small arc of the entire circular SNR most of which is out of the frame to the lower right.   Sh2-96 is one of the SNRâ€™s major filaments located along the northern edge.  The red HII area, in the upper center of the image, is thought to be surrounding galactic nebula into which the SNR is expanding.",
