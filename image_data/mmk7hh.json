    "description": "A colorful cosmic mess.\r\nAround 11,000 years ago a star 800 light years from here went supernova and exploded. What remains is known as the Vela Supernova Remnant which consists of glowing gas filaments and a pulsar. The VNR itself is thought to be embedded in a larger older supernova remnant which is the Gum Nebula.\r\nThis image captures only a portion of the Vela SNR in the central region.\r\nImaged in SHO Hubble Palette on our RH 350 F/2.8, 980 mm FL OTA at Obstech, Chile\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\r\nSystem Control Software: Voyager by Leo Orazi.\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/masterdarksastro",
