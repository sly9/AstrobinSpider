    "description": "This is the match to my sunrise picture taken in September 2020, only this one I actually planned using PhotPills back in July. The sunrise picture was just luck.\r\n\r\nThis was taken on my Nikon D750 and a 300mm Nikkor lens. The photos are 180 seconds apart. \r\n\r\nOf course, one lonely little cloud had to wonder into the frame!",
