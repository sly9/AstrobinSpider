    "description": "I started collecting the new photos needed for the shot back in January, but due to the weather and the placement of the object, I was able to take 300 raw images. Last year I wanted to take a photo of this object, but then the situation turned out differently.\n\nThe Boogieman fog is after the M78 in the Barnard Arc. Its shape resembles \"boogieman\". The area is very complex full of dust and gas mists.\n\nHis photography was very exciting because I was only able to expose him for 2-3 hours one night because the subject was heading towards distracting lights, so it was like I was photographing four subjects at night. There’s something that’s done, there’s something you’re publishing right now, and there’s something that’s average but not yet processed, plus there’s the series for which the raw is the most. :)",
