    "description": "It amazes me that structures like this exist in nature.  A giant sphere, seven light years in diameter, formed by stellar winds from a young, massive star that can be seen in the 5 o’clock position inside the bubble.  Pillars of ionized hydrogen gas laced with dust appear at the bottom and top of the picture, and more “fingers” appear faintly behind the translucent bubble. Also known as NGC 7365, it resides near the open cluster Messier 52 and the border of the constellation Cepheus. This false color image was created using a modified Hubble Palette (Sulfur=red, Hydrogen=green, Oxygen=blue). Details from https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/hubble-sees-a-star-inflating-a-giant-bubble and https://www.constellation-guide.com/bubble-nebula-ngc-7635.",
