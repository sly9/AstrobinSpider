    "description": "I like using Unity Gain, but with my level of light pollution, teetering between a Red Zone and White Zone, it means I need to keep my exposures short or risk being over-exposed.  This is M81 captured with 850 subs (each one 30 seconds).  I used a Lum filter with a 2\" CLS filter in front of it.",
