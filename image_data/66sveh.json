    "description": "It's getting more and more challenging to catch Jupiter. For one, this time of year is very cloudy in Singapore (spectacular thunderstorms though - see rev C!) plus Jupiter is above the roof of my neighbouring apartment block by the time it gets dark and seeing suffers accordingly.\r\n\r\nI managed some quick captures on the 17th and 25th of October, but it has taken me a while to get around to processing them. Here are the results.\r\n\r\nI was mainly hoping to see what has happened as a result of the NTrZ outbreaks. The NEB still appears to be in complete turmoil, and it's very difficult to distinguish the NEB, NtrZ and NTeB ... they almost seem to be intermixed!",
