    "description": "NGC 1532 is an edge-on barred spiral galaxy located approximately 50 million light-years from the Solar System in the constellation Eridanus. It may possess several dwarf companion galaxies. The galaxy is clearly interacting with one of these galaxies, the amorphous dwarf galaxy NGC 1531. The tidal forces from this interaction have created unusual plumes above the disk of NGC 1532.\r\n\r\nNGC 1532 is also an outlying member of the Fornax Cluster.",
