    "description": "Here is a nebula in the constellation Centaurus which was suggested to me during the last period of the new moon.\r\n\r\nNGC 5367 is a reflection nebula associated with the cometary globule CG12. CG12 extends over the entire diagonal of the image by more than 1 °. Discovered in 1976 on an ESO plate, CG12 contrasts with most other cometary globules because it is distant from the galactic disk. In fact, its galactic latitude is greater than 21 °. The NGC 5367 nebula reflects light from two bluish stars: the two components of the h4636 binary system.",
