    "description": "After imaging my first comet, I wanted to try C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) before it possibly disintegrates or – if we are lucky – gets brighter and even more impressive ;). \r\n\r\nThe biggest contrast to my first comet image (C/2017 T2) is, that this one does not have a bright round core. It is elongated and not saturating my camera even at 5 minute exposures, which C/2017 T2 did. It also does look uneven in the \"front part\", if you zoom in. Interesting and beautiful object.",
