    "description": "Drechser 21 (PNG 107.1-14.8) is a new, and by a spectrum confirmed planetary nebula and was already discovered by me in May 2019. The PN has a size of about 8 arc min and is located in the constellation Andromeda.\r\n\r\nMore information about Dr 21:\r\nhttp://planetarynebulae.net/FR/page_np.php?id=505\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nDr 21 was, as always, masterfully photographed by my friend, the Austrian astrophotographer Markus Blauensteiner at the Ursa Major Observatory (ROSA remote observatory southern alps).\r\n\r\nInteresting fact: In the south of Dr 21, but still within the nebula, Markus Blauensteiner and I discovered another potential PN, which is far behind Dr 21. Visually, however, it gives the impression that both PNs are connected. The second PN was named \"DrBl 1\" (PNG 107.1-14.9).\r\n\r\nMore information about DrBl 1:\r\nhttp://planetarynebulae.net/FR/page_np.php?id=816\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTelscope & Camera:\r\nLacerta N25010c Newtonian, f/D = 4\r\nSX Trius 694, Baader LRGB filter\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nExposure time:\r\n[OIII] 31x20 min / Ha 59x20 min / RGB 13x5 min per filter.\r\n33 h 15 min\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nPhoto: Markus Blauensteiner\r\nImage processing: Marcel Drechsler\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nDr 21 (PNG 107.1-14)\r\nCoordinates: 23:23:49.89 +45:16:54.43",
