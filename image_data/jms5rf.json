    "description": "Jones-Emberson 1 is a 14th magnitude planetary nebula in the constellation Lynx and lies some 1600 light years away.  The relatively close distance makes this a rather large nebula with low surface brightness.  Visible in this image is also the white dwarf central star of magnitude 16.8.",
