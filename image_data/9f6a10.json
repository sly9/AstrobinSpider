    "description": "Here is another rendition of IC10 - different from the one that I had posted yesterday. This region has a lot of Ha and hence the background. I did make an effort to not process Ha so much that it would stand out as 'red' background, but let the data speak for itself. \r\n\r\nI believe this is a more scientifically accurate representation of the galaxy, just not as eye pleasing as the version from yesterday - but I am fine with that. \r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts!",
