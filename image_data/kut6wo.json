    "description": "This is an object that I had on my target list for a long time and finally this year I planned to spend the whole summer on it and thus achieve a good amount of data. Unfortunately this year the weather has been very uncooperative and between troughs, dust from the Sahara, tropical waves, hurricane threats, I barely achieved 8.45 hours of integration. Still I decided to give it a try. Processing it presented quite some challenges as the Sahara dust layer that has prevailed this summer degraded many of the frames considerably and I had to work with them as is. Despite all the setbacks I am happy with the result I achieved. Thanks for watching!",
