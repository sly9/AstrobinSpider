    "description": "After captured Leo Triplet, M66 seemed a good target for my 11\" SCT. The shape of M66 looks like an Arabic numeral 6 in this image. Did Charles Messier see this way and listed it #66 in the catalog? The data was collected during the period of below-average seeing. I also collected Ha 48 frames of 900 seconds, however, I couldn't blend Ha into the Red channel due to lack of details. \r\nAny C & C are welcome\r\nThanks,\r\n-- Facts ----\r\nMessier 66 (a.k.a. NGC 3627) \r\nM66 is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Leo, discovered by French astronomer Charles Messier in 1780. M66 is located 35 million light-years from Earth, has an apparent magnitude of 8.9, and is about 95 thousand light-years across with striking dust lanes and bright star clusters along sweeping spiral arms.\r\n\r\nTechnical details:\r\nTelescope: Celestron Edge HD11 + Reducer 0.7x\r\nMount: AP Mach2GTO\r\nImaging cameras:ZWO ASI2600MM Pro\r\nSoftware: PHD2, PixInsight, Lightroom 6.4, Sequence Generator Pro, Photoshop CS6\r\nLocation: Palo Alto, California, USA\r\nPhotometricColorCalibration data (pre-corp):\r\nResolution ............... 0.198 arcsec/px\r\nRotation ................. -69.911 deg\r\nObservation start time ... 2021-03-30 05:44:23 UTC\r\nObservation end time ..... 2021-04-18 08:27:39 UTC\r\nFocal distance ........... 1955.68 mm\r\nPixel size ............... 1.88 um\r\nField of view ............ 26' 7.4\" x 19' 5.5\"\r\nImage center .............
