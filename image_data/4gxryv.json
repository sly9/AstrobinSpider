    "description": "Here's a One-Click Observation from Telescope Live of the Running Chicken Nebula.  I processed it in SHO and HSO and combined the two images.  It's only 2 subs each HA, OIII, and SII taken with their Planewave CDK24/FLI ProLine PL9000 in Chile.\r\nHope ya like it!\r\nTom\r\nPS: I can't see the \"Chicken\" but I guess it's because it's taken with a 24\" long fl scope!",
