    "description": "A relatively rarely photographed theme is a member of Sh2-132 Stewart Sharpless's 312 Bright Emission Fog. Each of the Sharpless Nebula flames from the light of the ionized hydrogen, which typically has a red color. We find dark spots in the picture, which is nothing more than a dust that cleans the bright parts of the fog and creates interesting formats. In addition to hydrogen, there is a lot of oxygen-rich parts that can be seen on blue, but here with the red they produce a very interesting color effect.\r\n\r\nSharpless 2-132 is an extremely low surface gloss emission mist on the boundaries of the constellations of Cepheus and Lacerta. As a member of the Cep OB1 association in the Perseus arm of our galaxy, its distance is around 10,000 light-years. The Wolf-Rayet star in the object is responsible for the ionizing of radiant hydrogen and oxygen gas clouds.\r\nInstrument:\r\n200/1000-es Newton,carbon astrograph, Camera:Atik ONE 6, Mount:SkyWatcher EQ6 GoTo\r\nGuiding:Lacerta Mgen OAG, Exposure:R:120; G:70; B:110; Ha:720 minute",
