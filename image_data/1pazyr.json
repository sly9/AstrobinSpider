    "description": "This is my first light with a 2nd hand v3 HyperStar lens.  Because of the strong light pollution in my neighborhood, my intention was to use narrowband filters, but the OIII filter produced a huge halo around the star 15S Monocerotis.  So...I switched to RGB filters and hoped for the best.   \r\n\r\nAfter an inmense and intense battle with the light pollution gradients, and in spite of the very weak signal I got in the Blue filter, I think I got a pretty decent image considering that this is from a Bortle 7-8 area.  \r\n\r\nI am very happy with the HyperStar and I know it will be permanently fixed to my scope for many months to come.",
