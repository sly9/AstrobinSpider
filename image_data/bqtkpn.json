    "description": "NGC 3324, also known as The Gabriela Mistral Nebula (who was a Nobel winning Chilean poet)  is located in the  Southern constellation Carina and is located at the northwest corner of the Carina Nebula complex.  It lies at a distance of 7,500 light-years from Earth and covers an area of about 35 light-years or about 12x15 arcmin and shines at magnitude +6.7.  Actually, the designation NGC 3324 is associated with the open cluster inside the nebula which is designated IC 2599 (Gum 31 bubble).  Stellar winds and intense radiation from the hot young stars in the open cluster NGC 3324 inside the emission nebula are responsible for the beautiful illumination of the HA, OIII, and SII ionized gases in this image.  At the lower left of this image is the cluster NGC 3293.  The image was taken at Deep Sky West-Chile and consists of mostly HA, OIII, and SII data with just bit of RGB data included for star color.\r\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\r\nTom",
