    "description": "Jupiter on Fri 14 Jun 2019 UTC.\r\n\r\nWinJUPOS derotation covering twelve minute period between 11:00 and 11:12 pm Canberra time as the planet neared maximum elevation. Although seeing was not as good as on Saturday reasonable detail is visible across 46 arc second disk. \r\n\r\nOf particular note is interesting spiral structure within SEB (right on the meridian) and S4-LRS-1 (South Polar Red Spot) rising in the west. Also previously jagged boundary between SEB and STZ now appears flattened. A number of dark spots pepper the NTB.",
