    "description": "\"The American Pelican\"\r\n\r\nOn the left, bright emission outlined by dark, obscuring dust lanes seems to trace a continental shape, lending the popular name North America Nebula to the emission region cataloged as NGC 7000. To the right, just off the North America Nebula's east coast, is IC 5070, whose profile suggests the Pelican Nebula. The two bright nebulae are about 1,500 light-years away, part of the same large and complex star forming region. At that distance, the 6 degree wide field of view would span 150 light-years.\r\n\r\nThis cosmic portrait uses narrow band images to highlight the bright ionization fronts in false color, also known as Hubble Palette, the same technique used by the famous Hubble Space Telescope. After more than 11 hours of exposure using a monochrome camera with Hydrogen Alfa (red), Sulphur (green) and Oxygen (blue) filters ended up with three black and white pictures, one for each filter, representing the gas in the nebula. The first picking up light in the frequency of Sulphur ions (assigned to the color red), the second Hydrogen (green), the third Oxygen ions (blue). Switching the red channel (Hydrogen) with green (Sulphur) reveals details that the human eye cannot easily see, if at all.",
