    "description": "I took the images used to create this panorama last week. I have been working on  acquiring images for a 135mm mosaic, so while my modded camera is imaging, I run around and work on some nightscapes with my other camera. 6 tracked images were used for the sky and 3 were used for the foreground and where edited and blended together in PS. \r\n\r\nSky images:\r\nSony A7riii, Tamron 35mm f1.4 @ 2.5, 179s, ISO 640\r\n\r\nForeground images:\r\nSony A7riii, Tamron 35mm f1.4 @ f1.8, 119s, ISO 640",
