    "description": "Fire in the sky. Eastern and Western Veil nebulas with Pickerings triangle in the middle. Witch's broom. Finger of God. Network Nebula. So many names for this structure or parts of it. And this structure is a supernova remnant, which exploded approximately 8000 years ago. In our sky it is huge, as big as Andromeda galaxy. Unfortunately, visually, it is a challenging object and not for small apertures. But, it is easily picked up by a camera, even a simple unmodified DSLR. I have imaged part of this nebula 4 years ago, and it still came out quite great",
