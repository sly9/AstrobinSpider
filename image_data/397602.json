    "description": "My try with M106 , a beautiful and large galaxy  with LRGB and Halpha subs to enhanced the core with its filaments. You can also see small spiral galaxies around : NGC3231, 4231 , and 4226  and a larger one like a yellow UFO :  NGC4217 !\r\n\r\nsee zoom in M106 here : <a href=\"https://astrob.in/397674/0/\">Zoom in -  M106 and Friends</a>\r\n\r\nWiki :  It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781. M106 is at a distance of about 22 to 25 million light-years away from Earth. M106 contains an active nucleus classified as a Type 2 Seyfert, and the presence of a central supermassive black hole has been demonstrated from radio-wavelength observations of the rotation of a disk of molecular gas orbiting within the inner light-year around the black hole\r\n\r\nFor the Light , I selected around 30% of the best Fwhm subs and combined them with all the subs to get sharper details and smaller stars\r\n 5 Nights  were necessary to get the subs:  13,14, 15, 16 and 24 of  February\r\n\r\nRed 30 subs@180s -20°C gain 139\r\nBlue 30 subs@180s -20°C gain 139\r\nGreen 38 subs@180s -20°C gain 139\r\n\r\nLight 113 subs@180s -20°C, gain 139 and zero\r\nHalpha 96 subs@180s -20°C gain 139\r\n\r\nTell me what you think  ?",
