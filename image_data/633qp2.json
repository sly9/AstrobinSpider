Looking for an alternative.  In the meantime, playing around with some techniques with what I have.  Attempted to layer in RGB stars with little success.  \r\nHope you enjoy and clear skies.\r\n\r\nAbout 3 hours of RGB data with Optolong L-Extreme at 120 gain for 180 seconds\r\nAbout 3 hours of Ha with Baader f2 filter at 120 gain for 180 seconds at BIN1 with 294MM pro.\r\nThe data at BIN1 with MMPro is the best I have ever taken.  \r\nI used the Ha as luminance for the HOO mapped image with the Optolong L-extreme",
