    "description": "This is a reprocessing of data I collected at the end of 2018. In prior versions I used a standard SHO approach and HST palette. This time I used Steve Milne's \"natural\" narrowband Pixinsight pixel math formula. I also cropped and rotated the image to give it a bit more drama. At the top of the image is the Cone Nebula and beneath it, the Christmas Tree Cluster. Moving down the image are the Fox Fur Nebula and the Snowflake Cluster. And, yes, it is still cloudy in Northern California.",
