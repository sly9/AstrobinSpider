    "description": "Hi all, Mars on August 24 with fair to seeing and good transparency! \r\nIn the image we can see the Meridiani Planum area, resting place of the Opportunity robot jeep, in the central portion of the image, above Noachis Terra and below, the great Arabia Terra desert. On the right we have Margaritifer Terra, which stands out as a patch of albedo quite contrasted with the clear areas around it and on the left, already at the Martian terminus, Terra Sabaea is already getting ready for another night. :^)",
