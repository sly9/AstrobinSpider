    "description": "Got some unexpected clear skies and decided to get as much quality Lum data for this since the previous attempt only yielded decent RGB data and poor Lum data. I am really, really happy I was paying attention and have an observatory ready to go at a moments notice. Still working on my processing skills, but I am making progress.\r\n\r\nI did change my dithering protocol. In SGP I increase the dither amount to \"high\" and went to every frame instead of every 3. From what I read with long subs, the time to dither is small enough that it will pay off in the stacking with rejection doing its thing. I do feel that this was a success, the Lum data here was really clean after stacking.",
