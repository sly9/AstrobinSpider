    "description": "This object is a part of the Vela supernova remnant, located 800 light years away in the southern constellation of Vela. It is estimated that the supernova exploded approximately 12,000 years ago. The Vela supernova remnant overlaps the Gum supernova remnant, and the two are among the largest and brightest features in the X-ray sky. The Vela SNR is one of the closest supernova remnants to earth.\r\n\r\nThe region captured in this image shows a spiraling helical length of twisting OIII filaments.  A large patch of hydrogen provides the flame.    An interesting bright hydrogen nebula is seen at the lower left of the image.  \r\n\r\nMy favorite part of the image are the faint reddish Ha wisps which follow some of the leading arcs of the greenish OIII filaments.\r\n\r\nThe weak strength of these emissions, combined with the low declination of the target from my viewing site, makes this a tough object for me to capture.",
