    "description": "A rare straight 7 days of near perfect weather, and I got called in for jury duty during most of it. That meant NO traveling out to my favorite darker sky site. Instead, I set up behind my home and let it run while I slept. I had never shot this region before and it was largely unobstructed for both nights, so it was ideal. To help gather some detail, I captured Ha and OIII in addition to the RGB. I'm not really the best at blending all this data, but the NBRGB script in Pixinsight really helped bring it all together.\r\n\r\nLots of stuff going on in this image, starting with Sh2-157 (Lobster Claw) on the left, with the small open cluster NGC 7510 below it. To the top center is the Bubble Nebula (NGC 7635), with open cluster M52 just above and to the left. Below that is a small red diffuse nebula Sh2-159 and emission and reflection nebula NGC 7538.",
