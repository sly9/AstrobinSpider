    "description": "I finally found time to process my Saturn data from the same night as my recent <a href='https://www.astrobin.com/404469/C/'>Jupiter image</a> and <a href='https://www.astrobin.com/404807/0/'>Jupiter animation</a>.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the dew that (unexpectedly and unbeknownst to me) formed on my corrector towards the end of the Jupiter captures was present for the entire Saturn session, compromising the data slightly. This is evident from the \"ghosting\" around the edges of the planet and rings.\r\n\r\nNone-the-less, some good detail is visible.\r\n\r\nThe final image represents 9 x 90s captures de-rotated in WinJUPOS.",
