    "description": "The colorful \"Hidden Galaxy\" (IC 342) imaged over November-December 2020 with my mobile setup, the 250 mm f/4 Lacerta PhotoNewton and ZWO ASI183MM Pro camera on the Orion HDX-110 EQ-G mount. IC 342, the largest galaxy of the Maffei/IC 342 Group, is roughly 10 Mly from us. Due to the proximity to the Galactic plane , it is obscured by intervening dust and gas and appears dim and highly reddened. IC 342 has a prominent bar in the center and a well-developed spiral structure with lots of regions of recent and ongoing star formation.\r\n\r\nThis image was produced using both broadband (LRGB) and narrowband (H-alpha) data. The R channel is a combination of R data and H-alpha data. The luminance image is composed of the three different sets of exposures 90s, 180s and 300s duration taken at different camera gain settings (0 and 110).\r\n\r\nExposure Information:\r\nL: 28x300s (Gain 0 bin 1x1)\r\nL: 30x180s (Gain 0, bin 1x1)\r\nL: 24x90s (Gain 110, bin 1x1)\r\nR: 47x180s (Gain 110, bin 1x1)\r\nG: 31x180s (Gain 110, bin 1x1)\r\nB: 38x180s (Gain 110, bin 1x1)\r\nHa: 28x600s (Gain 200, bin 1x1)\r\n\r\nTotal exposure: 14.9 hours",
