    "description": "Sometimes known as the Bow-Tie or Moustache Nebula this beautiful shockwave of glowing filaments of Ionised Oxygen overlaps the Hydrogen Alpha rich Gum nebula region.  At this orientation it resembles cosmic butterfly wings. \r\nWithin the Eastern section of the Vela Supernova Remnant, the expanding debris cloud is from the death explosion of a massive star. Light from the supernova explosion that created the Vela remnant reached Earth about 11,000 years ago. In addition to the shocked filaments of glowing gas, the cosmic catastrophe also left behind an incredibly dense, rotating stellar core, the Vela Pulsar. Some 800 light-years distant, the Vela remnant is likely embedded in a larger and older supernova remnant, the Gum Nebula.
