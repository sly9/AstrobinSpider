    "description": "Completed 100 hours of narrow band data, 45 hours from last year (Apogee 8300) plus 55 hours from current year (QHY600). Acquired with an AP 6.6-inch apo refractor, FL 1250 mm. Composition is HS:HSO:O, and the processing tries to approach the HST image, with emphasis on the core details rather than surrounding nebulosity. My longest integration thus far.",
