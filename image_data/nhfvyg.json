    "description": "=================================================================================\r\n**For a higher-quality version of the time-lapse animation, please visit the link below**\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lmWe_QJrPQmf9hYI5chYIhOf_SAzHnYT\" target=\"_blank\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lmWe_QJrPQmf9hYI5chYIhOf_SAzHnYT</a>\r\n\r\nPlease note: the Animated PNG (APNG) format <u>does not work in all browsers</u> - recommend you use Google Chrome on a laptop/desktop computer (it will likely not work on mobile devices).\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\n- Click on the link above to open the shared Google Drive folder, then double click on the image.\r\n\r\n- <u>The file is large</u> (105Mb) and will take a little time to load.\r\n=================================================================================\r\n\r\nI thought we had been lucky on the 27th November when I captured <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/f8ahhd/B/\" target=\"_blank\">my previous aurora image</a> ... but it turned out this was just a prelude to the \"main event\" on the night of 29th November.\r\n\r\nIn total I captured over 300 images that night. At times it seemed as though half the sky was on fire, making it difficult to decide where to point the camera ... it certainly was quite a show! Given we are at the minimum of the Sun's 11 year activity cycle and the weather is often quite cloudy at this time of year, we feel very lucky indeed to have witnessed it.\r\n\r\nThe image presented here is my favourite of the night, partly due to the spectacular patterns shown but primarily due to the bright band that appears on the left-hand edge of the image. When we showed this image to a native SÃ¡mi reindeer herder the next day, she became quite excited as the pattern formed by this band resembles their traditional \"teepee\" houses.\r\n\r\nThe time-lapse animation consists of 183 individual captures (10 seconds each @ f2.2, ISO800) over a period of approximately 45 minutes total. The main still image occurs at frame 165.\r\n\r\nThe file format restrictions of Astrobin only permit the use of GIFs for animation, a file format that was designed for blocks of solid colour ... this means it does not handle gradients at all gracefully, and doesn't do justice to the event in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI therefore implore you to take the effort to view the Animated PNG (APNG) version, which can be found at the link above and below:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lmWe_QJrPQmf9hYI5chYIhOf_SAzHnYT\" target=\"_blank\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lmWe_QJrPQmf9hYI5chYIhOf_SAzHnYT</a>\r\n\r\nThe downsides of the APNG format:\r\n\r\n1. It is not currently supported by all browsers, so I recommend using Google Chrome on a laptop/desktop computer (it will likely not work on mobile devices).\r\n\r\n2. For the animation to play, the file must be opened in a separate browser window. Therefore I have linked to the folder only - you will need to double-click on the APNG image to open and play it.\r\n\r\nWARNING: the APNG <u>file is quite large</u> (105Mb) and will take some time to load. But hopefully you will agree it's worth the wait.  :)\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
