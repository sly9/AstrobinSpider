    "description": "NGC 3199 is an emission nebula in the constellation Carina. It is commonly known as the Banana Nebula. The object was discovered in 1826 by the Scottish astronomer James Dunlop. It is a bow shock around the central star, WR 18, an especially hot and especially luminous Wolf–Rayet star. The bright edge was thought to indicate a bow shock produced as the star plowed through a uniform medium, like a boat through water. But measurements have shown the star is not really moving directly toward the bright edge. So a more likely explanation is that the material surrounding the star is not uniform, but clumped and denser near the bright edge of NGC 3199. According to Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nSince I have no astro darkness at my own obsy I take the opportunity to process some sothern hemisphere data by joining Telescope Live at the El Sauce hosting facility at 1500m elevation in Río Hurtado, Coquimbo Region, Chile. LRGB data contains 4 x 10 min for each colour channel and 6 x 10 min Lum.",
