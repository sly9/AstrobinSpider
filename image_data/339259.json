    "description": "Early that morning, it was still dark and I saw the crescent moon still shining with light. I decided to make a close up with the Tamron at 1200 mm. Unfortunately, the time to install the equipment, to point and make the focus, the sky had cleared up.\r\n\r\nThat's when I saw the big clouds rise. I then changed my rifle and quickly installed the 135 mm on a light tripod. Among a series of shots, I choose two, one whose focus was made on the clouds iridescent by the rising sun and the other on the moon that had already turned pale.",
