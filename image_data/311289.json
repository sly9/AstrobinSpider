    "description": "ESO just posted a press release with some images from one of the 8.2 m telescopes in the VLT array, now equipped with new adaptive optics. See:\r\nhttp://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1724/\r\nI thought there was more to bring out of these images with some processing in PS, using tricks like deconvolution and high pass filtering, and some curve stretching to bring out more faint stuff, so here is my version of the IC4406 from one of these 8.2 m telescopes",
