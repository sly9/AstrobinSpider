    "description": "* Acquisition: iTelescope-Portugal.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* Distance: 12 Mly.\r\n\r\n\r\nCentaurus A is a species of galactic fossil. The light used to produce this image was emitted more than 12 million years ago when mammals dominated the earth and humanity had not yet taken its first steps.\r\n\r\nCentaurus A is considered an object of interest essentially for 2 reasons:\r\n• It is quite bright what makes it ideal for astrophotography and\r\n• Is the radiogalaxy closest to our planet, reason why its active nucleus has been the object of extensive studies.\r\n\r\nLooking at the image, we find that Centaurus A is a peculiar galaxy that does not appear to be ellite nor spiral. The explanation is given by computer simulations that show that Centaurus A was a large elitist galaxy that collided and merged with a smaller spiral galaxy.\r\n\r\nIn the image it is possible to observe:\r\n• Regions formed by blue clusters containing young stars,\r\n• Imposing dark bands of dust that hide young stars whose origin may be related to what is left of the center of the molten galaxy and\r\n• A central glow caused by hundreds of billions of older and cooler stars.",
