    "description": "This would have come out better if I had used the Newtonian, but I had the refractor up and this target was well-positioned, so I did it with the refractor. Even with a decent amount of data, I found it very hard to keep the noise down while preserving structure - and there is a lot of interesting structure in this one. \r\n\r\nAlso of note is Asteroid 189 Phthia, which can be seen to the center-right of the image. I first thought it was a cosmic ray, but it couldn't find it any of my subs, so I looked more closely and found movement over the 3-hour period I did the RGB field. You can find an animation of it here: https://www.astrobin.com/332490/",
