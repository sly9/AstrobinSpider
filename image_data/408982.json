    "description": "A planetary nebula in the constellation of Bootes. It was discovered in 1995 by George Jacoby. Allegedly one of the faintest planetary nebulae, this really was a challenge but eventually I managed to drag out of it some structural detail. But then I did have to capture over 42 hours of OIII at bin 3x3! Not for the faint hearted!",
