    "description": "Trying out Eric Coles narrowband HST- selective histogram level colour mapping & editing technique again. Very pleased with the effect and results, a processing game changer really!\r\nExcept I like RGB stars much more than NB purple or white ones. - (Sorry Eric!)\r\n\r\nAt 5,500 light years distant, the Cat's Paw nebula NGC 6334 is an emission nebula with a red colour that originates from an abundance of ionised hydrogen atoms. Alternatively known as the Bear Claw Nebula, stars nearly ten times the mass of our Sun have been born there in only the past few million years. Pictured here is a deep field image of the Cat's Paw Nebula in light emitted by hydrogen, oxygen, and sulphur. (text from Apod).\r\n\r\n\r\nHa - 11x1200secs\r\nO3-17 x 1800 secs\r\nS2- 10x1200secs\r\nRG&B 10x180 secs ea.\r\nCaptured via Ekos on a Mac.\r\n\r\nProcessed in APP & PS CC 202 with Topaz NR\r\nTaken from my light polluted suburban backyard in Melbourne, Victoria.",
