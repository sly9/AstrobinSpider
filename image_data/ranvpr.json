    "description": "NGC 2264 identifies two astronomical objects as a single object: the Cone Nebula, and the Christmas Tree Cluster. Two other objects are within this designation but not officially included, the Snowflake Cluster, and the Fox Fur Nebula.\r\n\r\nAll of the objects are located in the Monoceros constellation and are located about 800 parsecs or 2,600 light-years from Earth. (Source: Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nWe've had 3 consecutive clear nights for December's new moon, who would have thought 2020 would end with something positive :) I have spent the precious clear nights in a Bortle 4 area imaging one of my favorite deep sky objects. There's a lot happening in this image, which makes me want to revisit this area with various focal lengths. \r\n\r\nClear Skies, and Merry Christmas!",
