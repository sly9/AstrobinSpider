    "description": "A panorama of a very bright display of noctilucent clouds (NLCs) on June 19, 2019, taken from southern Alberta in the evening twilight at 11:24 pm MDT, before they began to fade as the sun angle decreased. This was from the grand old barn site near home. \r\n\r\nEarlier in the evening – just 20 minutes earlier — there were wisps of NLCs much higher and even overhead, but they soon faded leaving this bright horizon display which lasted another hour. This display was in the northwest, centered at about 30° west of due north. \r\n\r\nThis is a 6-segment panorama from segments with a 50mm Sigma lens on the Sony a7III, each exposure 1 second at f/2.8 and ISO 400. Stitched with ACR.",
