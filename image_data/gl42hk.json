    "description": "Here's another image from last two weeks' clear skies. For the reasons I don't know I apparently did not take any Ha data so the image lacks the purple Ha regions. I also learnt a new term when googling this target, a field Galaxy which apparently means a Galaxy which is gravitationally alone.\r\n\r\nI cropped the image slightly more than usually just to bring it a bit closer.",
