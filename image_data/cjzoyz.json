    "description": "This was my first time imaging the Eagle nebula. It has been on my bucket list for a while and is the first image with my new mount, the Sky-watcher EQ6-R Pro\r\n\r\nThe Eagle Nebula (catalogued as Messier 16 or M16, and as NGC 6611, and also known as the Star Queen Nebula and The Spire) is a young open cluster of stars in the constellation Serpens, discovered by Jean-Philippe de Ch√©seaux in 1745-46. Both the \"Eagle\" and the \"Star Queen\" refer to visual impressions of the dark silhouette near the center of the nebula, an area made famous as the \"Pillars of Creation\" photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope. The nebula contains several active star-forming gas and dust regions, including the Pillars of Creation.\r\n\r\nThis region of active current star formation is about 7000 light-years distant. A spire of gas that can be seen coming off the nebula is approximately 9.5 light-years or about 90 trillion kilometers long.\r\n\r\nPresented in the Hubble pallet also known as SHO which stands for Sulfur-Hydrogen-Oxygen.  Hope you all enjoy and thanks for any constructive comments.\r\n\r\nEquipment:\r\nTelescope - Meade 6000 series 115mm APO refractor\r\nImaging Camera- ZWO ASI 1600mm Pro Cool\r\nMount - Sky-watcher EQ6-R Pro\r\n\r\nSoftware:\r\nSequence Generator Pro\r\nPixinsight\r\nLightroom\r\nPhotoshop\r\n\r\nLights:\r\nSII-30x300sec\r\nHA- 30x300sec\r\nOiii-30x300sec\r\nRed-30x60sec\r\nGreen-30x60sec\r\nBlue-30x60sec\r\n35 Darks\r\n100 Bias\r\n\r\nTotal integration 9 Hours",
