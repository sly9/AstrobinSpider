    "description": "Before more than two years ago I already tried to photograph Thor's helmet. Due to the low height of maximum 25 degrees above the horizon and a very strong color shift due to the turbulent air layers, the result with my DSLR was very sobering. \r\n\r\nReason enough to start a new attempt. :-) During the last full moon phase I was able to gather more than 11 hours of data with my CCD this time. The conditions were not perfect again - but I'm nevertheless very satisfied with the result.",
