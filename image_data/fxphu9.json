    "description": "The Pelican Nebula is slowly being transformed. IC 5070, the official designation, is divided from the larger North America Nebula by a molecular cloud filled with dark dust. The Pelican, however, receives much study because it is a particularly active mix of star formation and evolving gas clouds. The featured picture was produced in three specific colors -- light emitted by sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen -- that can help us to better understand these interactions.\r\nShot through 16\"f3.7 16803CCD L-HaRGb for around 9hrs from B1 SKIES\r\nCOPYRIGHT;  TEAM INSIGHT",
