    "description": "M63, 33 hours LRGB with Ha added with a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer. My primary goal with this image was to reveal as much of the surrounding halo material as possible without too much of a flat low contrast look. Because I wanted to reveal the faint structure really well, I dedicated more time than usual to RGB to get some color in it. Revision B is inverted with a stronger stretch so you can really see all the halo material.",
