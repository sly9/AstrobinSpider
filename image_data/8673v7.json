    "description": "NGC 6726 together with 6727 & 6729 (both shown) are in a complex of several reflection nebulae located between two variable stars (R CrA and T CrA, shown) in Corona Australis. The complex is brightest near R CrA. Also visually very close to them is a bright nebula IC 4812 (shown), which is 424 light years from our solar system.\r\n\r\nNGC 6723 is a 7th magnitude Globular Cluster appearing in the constellation Sagittarius. It is 28 thousand light years from our solar system. \r\n\r\nThis image contains both the reflection nebula and the cluster.",
