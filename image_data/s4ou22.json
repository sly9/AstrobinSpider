    "description": "Taken the same night as my most recent Jupiter image. Seeing was still excellent, however the cloud cover had become more consistent by this stage which only permitted a single, 3 minute capture.\r\n\r\nA blend of stacks using the top 15 and 20% of those frames was used to create this image.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
