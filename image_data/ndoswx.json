    "description": "Lynds Dark Nebula LDN1251 in Cepheus, Imaged from Spain with Roboscopes Pier 5 the Tak Epsilon 180ed. Fitted on our recent trip to the observatory this is the first image taken with the ZWO ASI2600MC Cmos camera. 96x 300s exposures, 8hrs total. I really like this camera!. \nThe subs were plague of satellite trails, but I was still able to use every exposure.  The shear number of subs gave a good rejection in the stack with no signs of satellites in the final image even after  such an aggressive process.  \nProcessed with Pixinsight and Photoshop\nThanks for looking\nPeter",
