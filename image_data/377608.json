    "description": "First light for our second remote rig at e-EyE, the classic hubble palette image of the Heart of the Heart - a very striking image to test the setup.  Mr & Mrs Gnomus and I visited the remote observatory in mid-October for some maintenance on our first joint rig and to setup Steve's TEC140 and QSI690 on my newly acquired GM2000HPS II UP.  I have high hopes for this rig imaging at 0.75\"/px will enable some fine detailed imaging and I am excited about the approaching galaxy season.  Thanks to Steve & Lis for the teamwork and effort.\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne.\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
