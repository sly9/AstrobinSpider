    "description": "This was brutal finishing this off. Usually this time of year there are a lot of clear nights. I started in anticipation of that; not so much so. My goal with this project was to bring out more OIII than what I have seen before and bring out more detail in Ha in general making the background more subtle. I combined this in a Ha and OIII bicolor palette and then added in RGB stars.\r\n\r\nCTB1 is a nearby supernova remnant (SNR) with an apparent diameter of about a half a degree (about the same size as a Full Moon). Upon early discovery, CTB1 was thought to be a planetary nebula, so Abell included it in his catalog of planetary nebulae as Abell 85. It was identified as a SNR by van den Bergh et al. in 1972 based upon its optical half-circular shape consisting of radiative filaments. Deeper images taken in H-alpha by Fesen (1993) show that it has a complete circular shape except for the unusual breakout structure toward the northeast, which also shows up in X-Ray images. Distance and age estimates are 10,000 light years, and 7,500 â€“ 11,000 years, respectively. It spans nearly 100 light years.",
