    "description": "George Ogden Abell (1927 – 1983) was a research astronomer at UCLA.  He produced two astronomical catalogues, derived from the photographic plates of the National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (NGS-POSS).  These are the Abell catalog of rich clusters of galaxies (1958), and a list of 86 planetary nebulae (1966).\r\n\r\nThis image is catalogued as Abell ‘planetary’ 85.  However, we now know that it is not a planetary nebula.  Rather it is a faint supernova remnant located 7,500 – 11,000 light years from Earth in the constellation of Cassiopeia.  Abell 85 spans some 100 light years and occupies an area of the sky similar to that of the full moon.  \r\n\r\nAbell 85 has also been catalogued as radio source CTB 1 ('CalTech obs list B'; Wilson & Bolton, 1960) and LBN 576 (Catalogue of Bright Nebulae, published by Beverly Lynds in 1965).   \r\n\r\nAbell 85 is an extremely faint object and, despite gathering a large amount of data, the processing was a significant challenge.\r\n\r\nData for this object were captured between 31 August and 11 September 2018, from a remote imaging rig (located in Spain) that is jointly owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nCamera: QSI 683 WSG\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 33 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 43 x 1200s\r\nRed: 24 x 600s\r\nGreen: 24 x 600s\r\nBlue: 24 x 600s\r\n\r\nA total of 37.3 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData Capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
