    "description": "Here is a more recent version of Messier 51 we recently finished at DSW. Was surprised with how much faint IFN was in the area. Version B shows an enhanced version of this, but I sadly didn't make it the final version just because of how much it equally enhances the halos on the stars related to the large central obstruction with the RH-305. Regardless, I think it is a fun set to play with that shows some really nice sharpness of the scale of the image.",
