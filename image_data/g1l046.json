    "description": "Cederblad 214, also called Sharpless 171 (Sh2-171),  is part of the NGC 7822 complex in the constellation Cepheus.  The star cluster to the lower left of center is Berkeley 59.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7822]:\r\n\r\n“The complex encompasses the emission region designated Sharpless 171, and the young cluster of stars named Berkeley 59. The complex is believed to be some 800–1000 pc distant,[5][6] with the younger components aged no more than a few million years.[5][6] The complex also includes one of the hottest stars discovered within 1 kpc of the Sun, namely BD+66 1673, which is an eclipsing binary system consisting of an O5V that exhibits a surface temperature of nearly 45,000 K and a luminosity about 100,000 times that of the Sun.[5] The star is one of the primary sources illuminating the nebula and shaping the complex's famed pillars of creation-type formations, the elephant trunks.[5][7][8] “\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the image!",
