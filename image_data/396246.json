    "description": "Starburst galaxy IC10 in Cassiopeia\r\n\r\nIrregular galaxy- one which does not have usual recognizible spiral shape of the galaxies. Starburst galaxy- one in which many new stars are being born.\r\nNot a standard look, having different shape when looking through different filters, it has created quite unique and interesting post processing challenges. Overall I am very pleased with natural and beautiful look of this photo.\r\nThis is yet another object imaged from my backyard, from outskirts of Kaunas city and yet another solid proof that it is possible to image deep sky from a city, even though it would look even better from a dark site.",
