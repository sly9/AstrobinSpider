    "description": "To end this first year in remote imaging from Chile, all in rich colors, here is the venerable reflection nebula M78 in Orion. \r\n\r\nDiscovered by the French astronomer Pierre MÃ©chain in 1790, it is the brightest diffuse nebula of a group of nebulae which includes NGC 2064 and NGC 2067. M78 is an interstellar dust cloud that shines under the effect of light diffused and reflected by the bright blue stars. The complex cluster is located approximately 1,350 light years away.\r\n\r\nA two frame mosaic with RHaGBOiii combination of this spectacular Orion area.\r\n\r\nSome great details at full resolution too! \r\n\r\nThank you for your visit!",
