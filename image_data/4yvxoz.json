    "description": "I had not planned to image M31 again this season, but after installing a new motor focuser on my ED80 I wanted to try it out with the 1600MM and needed a target that was suitable and well positioned.  Andromeda fit the bill and so I have now imaged it for the third year running.  It's hard to tell but this is actually a 2 panel mosaic as M31 doesn't quite fit using a single frame using the ED80 reduced to f6.3 and the 1600MM.  I shot 90 minutes on each panel, 40x45s Lum, and 10x120s RGB.  I then downsampled all channels 2x2 to improve the SNR given the fairly short total exposure time.  I tried for the most 'natural' color I could simply balancing the RGB in the histogram and boosting saturation a bit.",
