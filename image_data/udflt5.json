    "description": "The Rosette Nebula is a large spherical molecular cloud in the Monoceros (the Unicorn) region of the Milky Way.  It measures about 130 light-years in diameter and is around 5,000 light-years away.  It was created only a few million years ago when a giant molecular cloud collapsed.  At its centre, a young open cluster is present, NGC 2244.  This star cluster contains several blue-white O-type stars which are some of the hottest and brightest stars in our universe.\r\n\r\nAs you move outwards away from the centre, darker splotches known as Bok Globulares are present.  They are dense clouds of gas and dust, and from our vantage point, they appear as black holes in the cosmos.  I think they look very cool.\r\n\r\nTo create this image, I combined the light from seven different filters.  These include both broadband and narrowband filtered light using a monochrome camera.  My intent was to retain a natural look even though I had a great deal of narrowband data incorporated in the final result.  Stong emission data from narrowband data can overwhelm the traditional colour components in the final result.  \r\n\r\nEquipment Details:\r\n•\t10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\n•\tAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\n•\tSBIG STL 11000m\r\n•\tFLI Filter Wheel\r\n•\tAstrodon LRGB Filters\r\n•\tBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n•\tBaader Planetarium OIII 8.5nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n•\tBaader Planetarium SII 8.0nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\n•\tLum 77 X 900 Bin 1\r\n•\tRed 24 X 450 Bin 2\r\n•\tGreen 23 X 450 Bin 2\r\n•\tBlue 48 X 450 Bin 2\r\n•\tHa 36 X 900 Bin 1\r\n•\tSII 27 X 900 Bin 1\r\n•\tOIII 16 X 900 Bin 1\r\n\r\nTotal Time: 50.975 Hours",
