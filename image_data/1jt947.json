Discovered by William Herschel and first photographed in 1912. As can be seen in this image (or, better, image B), the bar actually partially wraps the nucleus and, at the top, appears to radially morph into a spiral arm, or a streak of dark clouds edging the spiral arm. The lower bar appears also as a dark cloud lining a spiral arm out to a pint where that arm abuts another arm at a high angle. The nucleus has an array of surrounding rings, best seen above the nucleus (toward the North). A study of this region immediately around the nucleus by Falcón-Barroso et al. (2013) found hot-spots consistent with being a star-forming region, and that the ~100 pc region around the nucleus also had a substantial reservoir of molecular gas—unusual for an active-core galaxy, but consistent with the also unusual star formation proximal to an active core.",
