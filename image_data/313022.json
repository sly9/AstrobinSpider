    "description": "This is my first start-to-finish image in 9 months.  Between the stressful process of relocating to a new home in southern Arizona and arriving just before the Monsoon season, it's taken this long for the weather and my equipment to get into sync.  Having a dark sky overhead (Bortle 3), is incredible.   Before I moved from my Bortle 7 southern California location I had never seen the Milky Way. Now I see it nearly every night.  Definitely happy I made the move.\r\n\r\n\"Sh2-155  is a diffuse nebula in the constellation Cepheus, within a larger nebula complex containing emission, reflection, and dark nebulosity. It is widely known as the Cave Nebula.  Sh2-155 is an ionized H II region with ongoing star formation activity.  It lies at an estimated distance of 2,400 light-years from Earth.\r\n\r\nSh2-155 was first noted as a galactic emission nebula in the 1959 extended second edition of the Sharpless catalogue.  Although Sh2-155 is relatively faint for amateur observation, some of its structure may be seen visually through a moderately sized telescope under dark skies.\r\n\r\nSh2-155 lies at the edge of the Cepheus B cloud, and is ionized by young stars from the Cep OB3 association.  It has been suggested that radiation from the hot O-type star HD 217086 is compressing the region, triggering the formation of a new generation of stars.  A study of the region's young stellar objects by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and Spitzer Space Telescope shows a progression of stellar ages in front of the cloud, supporting the hypothesis of triggered star-formation.\"  [Source: adapted from Wikipedia]\r\n\r\nProcessed:  [L(Ha)=1.00];   [R=.70 Ha, .3 SII];   [G= .15 Ha .85 OIII];   [B=1.00 OIII]",
