    "description": "This image is a joint work with my great friend and astrophotographer Maicon Germiniani. Maicon captured the data using his gear from SC, Brazil and provided the LRGB masters. I post-processed and assembled the data. Maicon's high quality data made my processing much more enjoyable. Thank you very much my friend\r\n\r\n\"Next to one of the most famous sky nebulas in the southern hemisphere we can find this beautiful open cluster. I am struck by the fact that despite its beauty, it is rarely photographed. Very close to it, we have another famous object: Gabriela Mistral Nebula, just outside this image' lower left corner. This image has a special meaning, being a joint work with a great friend and astrophotographer that astrophotography brought me.\"\r\n\r\nObject description by Maicon Germiniani\r\nCapture and Pre-Processing by Maicon Germiniani\r\nPost-Processing by Gabriel Rodrigues Santos\r\n\r\nTelescope: Triplet 115/800\r\nCamera: ZWO ASI 183MMPRO\r\nZWO FILTER WHEEL 8x1.25\r\nLRGB (210-60-60-60)\r\nTotal: 6.5 Hours\r\nAll frames in BIN 1x1\r\nAll frames 180 seconds\r\n\r\nPlease check out  <a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/users/GerminianiMaicon/\" target=\"_new\">Maicon Germiniani's Inspirational Gallery</a>\r\n\r\nThank you for taking your time to look at this image.
