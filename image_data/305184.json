    "description": "I imaged this object at the Green Bank Star Quest on my 11-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain reflector, with a much smaller field of view and much longer focal length. This image of it was taken on a 5-inch refractor, and the shorter focal length means larger FOV, which means more light concentrated per pixel, which allowed me to capture a lot more not only the inner detail, but the nebulosity surrounding the nebula.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent Nebula is the interaction of the strong stellar wind from a Wolf-Rayet star with its own ejected gas from its red giant stage a couple hundred thousand years ago. It's up in the constellation of Cygnus, the swan, which lies along the Milky Way, hence the red background nebulosity from hydrogen emission.\r\n\r\nBlog entry link: http://astronomollylog.blogspot.com/2017/07/100-friday-july-28-2017-100th-trip.html",
