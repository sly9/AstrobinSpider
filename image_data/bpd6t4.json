    "description": "This image is effect of five night sessions from  17 do 24th of April 2020\r\n\r\nSeeing was very good by two of this sessions - and I recorded luminance in that time. During rest of time I registered color channels.\r\n\r\nI collected in total 4000 frames of luminance but I've chosen 2200 for final photo. Only best ones to keep very good level of small dust lane details\r\n\r\nEquipment and exposition\r\n\r\nAstrofaktoria Newton 350/1400 on NEQ-6 + ASI 178MM-C  + Baader LRGB\r\nL - 2200x 10s (gain 86%) \r\nRGB - 500 x 12s (gain 86%) per channel\r\nsetup scale - 0,35''/pix",
