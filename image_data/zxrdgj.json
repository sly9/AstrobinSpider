    "description": "This is a quad lensed quasar that has been referred to in papers on discussing it as \"Andromeda's Parachute\". I did a very short imaging session that ended after only 13 seconds of data was stacked back in 2019, cut short by an abrupt end to good seeing that night. In October of 2020, I had another night of good seeing that was almost as good, and lasted most of the night, so I was able top obtain a couple images totalling 13 minutes - more than adequate to give a much clearer view, especially of the faintest quasar image, \"D\" which is fainter than 18th magnitude.\r\n\r\nIts interesting that as with the 2019 image, you can clearly see different colors in the different components, with B and C appearing a similar bluer color, while A and D have a distinctly more orange color. So it seems this color difference was not an artifact in the 2019 image. The images on opposite sides of the lensing galaxy seem to have matching colors. Image \"D\" wasn't bright enough in my 2019 image to really show any color. You can see the earlier image here:\r\n\r\n[URL=https://astrob.in/ce32ri/0/][IMG]https://astrob.in/ce32ri/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nAn interesting paper published in 2017 shortly after its discovery earlier that year can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05873\r\n\r\nThe magnified inset is sampled up to 300% of the original image size.\r\n\r\nEach of the two images were live stacked in Sharpcap using 0.5 second subs (ie a total of 1560 0.5 second subs were stacked to create this image). Short 0.5 second subs were used to help freeze the best moments of seeing to get the best separtion of the images.",
