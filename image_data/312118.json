    "description": "Image composite  of four images from two telescopes on a GEM during the eclipse.\r\n\r\nTelescope 1 - Hydrogen Alpha Lunt 80mm PST \r\nThis scope allows the user to see the photosphere and corona at the same time\r\nvia the Pressure tuning ablities of the scope. It allows only a small amount \r\nof energy through, hence it's name as a \"HA-Alph\" scope.  With this scope, no\r\nmoon disk would be seen, as it is not emitting HA.\r\n\r\nTelescope 2 - 130mm Refractor with a Baader SolarLite filter allowing only\r\nthe light of the light from the solar disk through.  Again, all other infomation\r\nwould be black.  \r\n\r\nAs the moon made contact with the solar disk, both my telescopes and thier cameras\r\nshow the infraction of the moon.  By using the data throughout the eclipse to \r\nextrapolate the moons size, I then placed it's shadow above the eclispe, just\r\nas it would have been, could my tech been capable of seeing it.\r\n\r\nCameras used- ZWO 174 & Canon 5D3\r\n\r\nMount used- Astro-Physics 1100GTO\r\n\r\nImages used- four, one from the 5D3 total eclipse to see the corona and one from the infraction \r\nof the moon, and two from the HA scope to again see the infraction, but also to\r\nsee the photosphere.  \r\n\r\nImage edited in AstroStakkert & Photoshop.\r\n\r\nImages recorded in Spring City, TN",
