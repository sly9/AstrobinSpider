    "description": "This is my wide field version of The Skull and Crossbones Nebula.  NGC 2467 is an active star-forming region in the constellation Puppis.  The presence of large hydrogen gas clouds is a key ingredient required for the creation of new stars.    \r\n\r\nObservations of the many stars in NGC 2467 suggest that they may be more a superposition of loose groups of stars at different distances than a coherent open cluster of stars energizing the nebula.   I guess it really depends on one's perspective in the universe, but from here, I think it looks awesome.\r\n\r\nThis version shows more of the surrounding areas around the nebula, including many colourful stars.  \r\n\r\nEquipment Details:\r\n•10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\n•Astro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\n•SBIG STL 11000m\r\n•FLI Filter Wheel\r\n•Astrodon LRGB Filters\r\n•Baader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n•Baader Planetarium OIII 8.5nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n•Baader Planetarium SII 8.0nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nExposure Details\r\n•Red 16X450 2X2\r\n•Green 16X450 2X2\r\n•Blue 16X450 2X2       \r\n•Lum 62X900             \r\n•Ha 26X1800             \r\n•SII 30X1800\r\n•OIII 28X1800\r\n\r\nTotal Time:  63.5 hours",
