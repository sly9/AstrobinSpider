    "description": "Wolf-Rayet stars are large, luminous stars that burn through their fuel in a relatively short period of time (millions rather than billions of years).  Such stars end their lives in a supernova explosion.  They were first reported by the French astronomers Charles Wolf (1827 – 1918) and Georges Rayet (1839 – 1906).\r\n\r\nWolf-Rayet 134 is located around 6,000 light years distant in the constellation of Cygnus.  Surrounding the star is a ring-like structure consisting of ionized hydrogen and oxygen gasses.   This image consists of data collected from 3nm Ha and OIII filters along with RGB data, shot primarily for star colour.\r\n\r\nData for this image were collected between 5 and 31 August 2019 from an imaging rig in Spain that is privately-owned and remotely-operated by Barry Wilson and me.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC 140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 21 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 21 x 1200s\r\nRed: 24 x 300s\r\nGreen: 24 x 300s\r\nBlue: 24 x 300s\r\n\r\nA total of 20 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
