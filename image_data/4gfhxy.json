    "description": "This is my second shot at processing the data for M83 from DSW in Chile.  My first attempt was so horrible that I actually removed it from AstroBin (first image I've ever removed)!  I sincerely hope that none of you remember that version, because if you do I'm sure it's haunting your dreams and ruining your perception of this beautiful object.\r\n\r\nI took a page out of my friend Gary Imm's playbook to give you a zoomed up image with the mouse over since this object is pretty small for the FOV, but I still think detail holds up.",
