    "description": "Data Credit : “Image Acquisition by the staff at Deep Sky West Remote Observatory (www.DeepSkyWest.com)”\r\n\r\nI downloaded free data on DSW website : https://www.deepskywest.com/free-downloads-v2\r\nA big thumb up to DSW for letting people get hands on top class data!\r\nI keep exploring the amazing data from DSW! For NGC 6992 I decided to make a Rha/GO3/BO3 processing and a emulated SHO in Orange/blue palette with the Ha and O3 masters.\r\n\r\nThis image is about the RGB enhanced by Ha and O3. You can check my other version here : \r\n\r\nObject presentation (from Wikipedia) :The Veil Nebula is a cloud of heated and ionized gas and dust in the constellation Cygnus.[4]\r\n\r\nIt constitutes the visible portions of the Cygnus Loop, a supernova remnant, many portions of which have acquired their own individual names and catalogue identifiers. The source supernova was a star 20 times more massive than the Sun which exploded between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago. At the time of explosion, the supernova would have appeared brighter than Venus in the sky, and visible in daytime. The remnants have since expanded to cover an area of the sky roughly 3 degrees in diameter (about 6 times the diameter, and 36 times the area, of the full Moon). While previous distance estimates have ranged from 1200 to 5800 light-years, a recent determination of 2400 light-years is based on direct astrometric measurements. (The distance estimates affect also the estimates of size and age.)\r\n\r\nThe Hubble Space Telescope captured several images of the nebula. The analysis of the emissions from the nebula indicate the presence of oxygen, sulfur, and hydrogen. The Cygnus Loop is also a strong emitter of radio waves and x-rays.\r\n\r\nProcessing apporach:\r\n-color layers :\r\nSubstrating of Continuum Spectrum for Ha from Red and for O3 from G and B.\r\nMade a Red master that is : R_CS + Ha\r\nG : G_CS + blend of O3 and a touch of Ha for color balance\r\nB: B_CS + blend of O3 and Ha to emulate Hb.\r\n\r\nColor calibration + denoising\r\nStreching \r\nACDNR\r\nand a bit of curves for final adjustments.\r\n\r\nLuminance:\r\nI deconvolved Ha and O3 then combined them using the simple operator H+O.\r\nDenoising, streching, dynamic compression, denoise....\r\nI then combined the RGB master to Luminance + plus minor adjustments.\r\n\r\nI hope you'll find it pleasant. \r\n\r\nLeave a comment and tell me what you think of my approach !\r\nCS\r\nAxel",
