    "description": "I have seen very few images of this subject, most seem to be with M106, I did think about taking it in portrait mode, but I rather liked the way the stars danced across the screen.\r\n\r\nI have learnt some new techniques which have helped immensely and I am rather pleased how this has turned out.\r\n\r\nHere's the bumf as usual, although there isn't a lot around: -\r\n\r\n NGC 4217 is an edge-on spiral galaxy which lies approximately 60 million light-years ( 18 million parsecs ) away in the constellation of Canes Venatici. It is a possible companion galaxy to M106 (also known as NGC 4258).",
