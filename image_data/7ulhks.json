    "description": "IC1805 - The Heart Nebula in SHO\r\n\r\nSHO is a color palette consisting of assigning Sulfur (Sii) filtered wavelengths to Red, Hydrogen-Alpha (Ha) filtered wavelengths to Green, and doubly-ionized Oxygen (Oiii) filtered wavelengths to Blue. There is a little bit more creative mixture that goes into it, as every HOO image is different, but that is the basic gist of the palette. This is also more famously known as the Hubble Palette. \r\n\r\nI attempted to get this completed for my girlfriend prior to Valentine's Day, unfortunately I had to re-do about 10 hours worth of acquisition, as well as narrowband imaging being brand new to me so the processing was quite different, and of course the curse of clouds and wind. Overall I'm happy with the final result and I can't wait to do more narrowband processing soon!",
