    "description": "A few of my imaging buddies got together at a semi-dark site not too far from Toronto.  Northern skies were the darkest skies so I decided to try the sunflower galaxy!\r\n\r\nTons of fun and it stayed clear until dawn so I stayed the entire night to get my last green subs to finish the image.  A really fun night.\r\n\r\nThanks for viewing!",
