    "description": "NGC 6188 is an emission nebula located about 4,000 light years away in the constellation Ara. The bright open cluster NGC 6193, visible to the naked eye, is responsible for a region of reflection nebulosity within NGC 6188.\r\nNGC 6188 is a star forming nebula, and is sculpted by the massive, young stars that have recently formed there â€“ some are only a few million years old.\r\nNote the crescent face at 8 o'clock from the NGC 6188 label.",
