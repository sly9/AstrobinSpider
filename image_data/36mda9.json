    "description": "The region around M81/M82 was the first place I saw images with IFN when I started out imaging and have attempted shooting it ever since. Each year I have tried to image IFN and from Austin, it has been all but impossible. However, with  my wide field scope at my dark sky observatory, this was hight on the list.   \r\n\r\nI originally  started with a 4 panel mosaic to get a very large region and then realized, inspite of dark skies, the broadband mosaics are very tough given the various sky conditions and with these huge subs, I simply cannot complete it properly. This one is a 2 panel mosaic to collect some interesting structures.\r\n\r\nI also used 15 minute subs through out to get the extra depth. The color data was challenging.. with different gradients between the two panel. Luckily it was minor enough to control.  I debated adding high res detail on the nebula from Edge11 to show the Ha filaments. But I think I like as is. \r\n\r\nThe result is a a very dusty field! \r\n\r\nL - 108 x 15 minute\r\nR/G/B - 24x15 minute / channel",
