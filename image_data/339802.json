    "description": "I setup SGP to wake up the mount scope at 3:45AM, went to sleep and woke up with 2 hours worth of subs. Plan to get another 4-5 hours and combine into a false color image. Maybe I should just be patient and wait a month or two for the summer milky way to rise earlier, but the bright nearly full moon was washing out the sky and I wanted to get Ha data on something and not waste a clear night ; )",
