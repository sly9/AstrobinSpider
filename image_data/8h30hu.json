The star clusters, consisting largely of young, massive, hot blue stars have formed from the dust and gas clouds around them. The hydrogen emission clouds, or “emission nebulae” shine due to the excitation of H, O, and S by the star clusters and other embedded, young stars. The ignition and intense burning of these very hot stars has created strong stellar winds and intense radiation that has ‘hollowed out’ cavities in the gas around them, sculpting the clouds.",
