    "description": "Tha Pacman nebula is a bright emission nebula and part of an H II region in the northern constellation of Cassiopeia and is part of the Milky Way's Perseus Spiral Arm. This 20Ã—30 arcmin sized nebulosity is also associated with open cluster IC 1590, several Bok globules and the multiple star, B 1 (source wikipedia).\r\n\r\nOk ok enough science.... isn't  <b> Pacman  a star eater chased by the Ghost of Cassiopea (IC63) ?</b>\r\n\r\nShot under decent skies a while ago and reprocessed now.\r\nHope you like it!\r\nCS\r\nAxel",
