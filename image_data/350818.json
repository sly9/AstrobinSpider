    "description": "Another Mars, this time on a slightly better night.  Still working with color balance from the filters on the ASI174MM, but I think I'm coming around to something more accurate.  This is also my first set of data with the ZWO ADC in place.  I think I had decent correction applied, but am sure I will be able to dial this in better in later attempts.\r\n\r\nReally looking forward to Mars growing in the sky over the coming weeks!",
