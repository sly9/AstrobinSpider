    "description": "This is a 4 panel mosaic of the SADR region that was undertaken in the summer with Barry Wilson.  Barry collected 2 hours and 40 minutes of Ha for each of the 4 panels using his Takahashi FSQ 85 and an Astrodon 5nm filter.  In the meantime, I captured 1 hour each of R, G and B through my WO Star 71 (Mark I) and Baader filters.  Both cameras used the KAF 8300 chip (Barry used a QSI and I used an Atik).  \r\n\r\nData collected between May and July 2016 - there isn't an awful lot of darkness during those months!\r\n\r\nBarry has already posted his processing of the data - http://www.astrobin.com/256430/?nc=user - but I never did get around to posting mine.
