    "description": "Finally got my first dark sky target on the new QHY268M during the April new moon. The well known southern galaxy Centaurus A. Admittedly, the conditions were not ideal with plenty of wind about and average seeing so couldn't extract as much fine detail as I would like. Nevertheless, I couldn't resist the opportunity of a clear sky before the rainy weather set in. It's the first time I've had to construct a color image from entirely monochrome images so was something of an experiment in learning more than anything else.\nWhile the modded Canon 250D has served me well, I'm very glad I made the switch to mono. And a 16bit APS-C mono at that!",
