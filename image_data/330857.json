    "description": "This is an enlarged version of our Soap Bubble image. I have noted the Central Star/Post-AGB Star on the image. Initially we thought this was a white dwarf. But we were corrected by George Jacoby, Astronomer and Deputy Director for Technology at the Lowell Observatory. Here is what  he said.\r\n\r\n\"Just to be clear, the central stars of planetary nebulae are not yet white dwarfs. They will soon be white dwarfs in a few 100,000 years. The difference is that PN stars still have nuclear fusion occurring as a power source while white dwarfs do not.\"\r\n\r\nThanks George.",
