    "description": "Helix nebula has been on my list since beginning of my astrophotography three years ago.  I have never gotten the chance to shoot  it. The main reason is its low on the sky from my backyard.  My neighbor house also blocked half of the time when it is above horizon.  Every clear night I  get roughly 3.5 hours per. The project was started on 8/9/2020 and completed on 9/12/2020. It took more than a month. \r\n\r\nThe eye itself is pretty bright, but the gas surround it are faint. 5nm HA required 10 hours for my 5.5\" lens. I did add 7.5 more hours to it. It didn't help much when comparing the integration at 100%.  In order to get a bit touch of gold,  7 hours S2 data is  also collected.   \r\n\r\nAt the end of the session last week, the smoke from California wild fire hit Texas, one night data was totally deleted. It was a clear night with very bad seeing.  \r\n\r\nI took my time to process  these data and tweak the color version by version. I hope this final image is appealing.\r\n\r\nDates:\r\n8/9/2020,  8/10/2020, 8/11/2020, 8/12/2020, 8/13/2020, 8/14/2020, 8/18/2020, 8/19/2020, 8/20/2020, 8/21/2020, 8/23/2020, 8/24/2020, 8/25/2020,  8/28/2020, 8/29/2020, 9/5/2020, 9/6/2020, 9/7/2020, 9/12/2020, 9/13/2020\r\n\r\n\r\nSubs info:\r\nha: 105x600\"\r\ns2: 42x600\"\r\no3: 60x600\"\r\nr/g/b: 30x120\" each",
