    "description": "I have been trying to hone some of my lunar imaging skills by attempting to image at longer focal lengths.  I have used the native f/10 of the C9, f/20 with a 2x Barlow, f/30 with a 3x Barlow and even F/50 with a Televue 5x Powermate.  It seems as ithough the f/30 images have come out the best.  I'm not sure why exactly as that Barlow is a fairly inexpensive Astromania.  Nothing good came out of the f/50 attempts, lol...\r\n\r\nThis image was done at f/20 using a 2x Celestron Shorty Barlow.  \r\n\r\nI love imaging Clavius and the surrounding area.  The morphological diversity of this area is simply awe inspiring to me.  It is never quite the same as the shadows play differently each time I try this one.  But this one is my favorite of all of the Clavius images I've done up until now.\r\n\r\nHope you like it and Clear Skies!\r\n\r\nBTW, a question I'll toss out there... I list the time of acquisition as GMT, is that the correct thing to do or should it be local time?",
