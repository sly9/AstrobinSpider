    "description": "A year and half ago, while I was new in astrophotography. I shot this object with HD8.  It is not  good looking back from now. So I decided to give it another try.  I did manage getting data for Ha and O3 after couple of weeks. However I was unable to finish S2 and RGB stars.   Every clear night I only got 3-4 hours window. Giving the incorporated weather forecast,  I don't think I could finish the project this spring.  So here you go, I processed it and put it up. I might add more to it this winter. \r\n\r\nHa: 61x600s\r\nO3: 60x600s\r\nS2: 12x600s",
