    "description": "I swore not to image Jupiter and Saturn this year because of their low height on the horizon, between 20 and 24 degrees. Well, I couldn't resist..\r\n\r\nI hesitated to publish this first image given the poor quality of the channels G and B.\r\nAlone, the IR 610 filter did its job (details in the equatorial zone), and that's the only reason I decided.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I made 5 videos of  74s per IR-GB channel  (from 20:45 to 21:05 or 20 minutes of derotation) and retained 7000 images/90,000 images).\r\nCreating an IR-GB image on WinJupos and then L-IR-GB on Photoshop with IR (IR reworked in gray and sharp).\r\n\r\nThe planet's orientation for aesthetics.",
