    "description": "M63 makes such a great target.  It's numerous intricate dust lanes can show lots of detail, while also having a wide range of colors.  With  the wispy gray outer region, the blues of the spiral edges, the golden core, and a few Ha regions that really stand out.  \r\n\r\nThis is the second image captured with my 12\" F4 newtonian and applying the lessons learned from the first target with sub exposure gain and duration payed off.  The original version is slightly cropped to show of a bit more detail in the galaxy.  The B version is the full frame which includes many small distant galaxies.",
