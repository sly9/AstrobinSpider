    "description": "I got almost 29 hours on this target, used around 25. I will say this was by far the hardest target I've ever imaged AND the hardest target I've ever processed. It took 2 months of collecting data and at one point I collected almost 20 hours with the wrong filter (Sii instead of Oiii) and had to start all over on the Oiii.  But I really love how it came out....the Spaghettifabulous Nebula!",
