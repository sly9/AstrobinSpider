    "description": "M106 and some surrounding smaller galaxies. Captured in LRGB with added Ha from my backyard in Ida Michigan. Bortle 5 (20.0 SQM). Captured over a month and a half. A lot of the color data was captured during moonlit nights and wasn't very high quality. But clear nights have been few and far between and it's time to move on to other targets.",
