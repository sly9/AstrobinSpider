    "description": "I was able to use the shortest nights of the year to finally image an object in our summer Milky Way again. :-) At the same time it was a test run for my Newtonian, which I had revised before (mirror cleaning, installation of an aperture ring above the main mirror and replacement of the secondary mirror with a new one). Fortunately this all worked out quite well. \r\n\r\nLDN 673 is a rarely photographed, but impressive dark nebula in the constellation Eagle. The object is a highly fractured and very dense dark cloud complex of about 7 light-years across, located in the center of the Aquila Rift, some 300 - 600 light-years from Earth in the northern constellation of Aquila.\r\n\r\nHope you like it :-)",
