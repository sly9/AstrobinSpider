    "description": "Centaurus A is a galaxy in the southern constellation of Centaurus.  Is is somewhere between 10 and 16 million lightyears from Earth.  It was discovered by James Dunlop from his home observatory in Parramatta in 1826.  It is the 5th brightest galaxy in our sky, possibly a naked eye object with a very dark sky.  Its unusual morphology saw it included in Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 153.  It was possibly formed by the merger of a large eliptical galaxy with a smaller spiral galaxy.",
