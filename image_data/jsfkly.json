    "description": "* Image acquisition: LTA\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa\r\n\r\nThis image was post processed using H-alpha as a luminance and (almost) RGB colors.\r\nIn the Red channel, I used 4 frames of Ha + 2 Green frames.\r\nIn the Green channel, I used Green.\r\nIn the Blue Channel, I used Blue and Sloan g.\r\n\r\nNGC 2359 (also known as Thor's Helmet) is an emission nebula in the constellation Canis Major. The nebula is approximately 12.000 light years away and 30 light-years in size. \r\n\r\nThe central star is the Wolf-Rayet star WR7, an extremely hot star thought to be in a brief pre-supernova stage of evolution. It is similar in nature to the Bubble Nebula, but interactions with a nearby large molecular cloud are thought to have contributed to the more complex shape and curved bow-shock structure of Thor's Helmet.\r\n\r\nSee also this objet in narrowband (bicolor):\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/386791/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/386791/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>",
