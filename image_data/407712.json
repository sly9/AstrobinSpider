    "description": "The night sky cleared for a couple of hour and I was able to grab a bit more data for this project that has spanned more than one year. It seemed that every time I aimed my telescope at this target, something either shortened the session and stopped it all together. I have a total of 12 hours of data collected over four day spread over 13 months. I chose an HOO approach to this image and I like the texture and areas of transparency that resulted.",
