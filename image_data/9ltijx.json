It is gravitationally bound to NGC 300, also in my Astrobin collection.\r\n\r\nThis nearly edge-on view shows dust bands and HII red clouds, and the blue from many young hot stars--NGC 55, apparently, has had a long history of high-rate star production. It is thought to be a barred galaxy, resembling the Large Magellanic Cloud. The distorted shape has be attributed to an abundance of super-novae explosions and extensive strong stellar winds.",
