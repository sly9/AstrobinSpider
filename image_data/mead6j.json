    "description": "Comet NEOWISE put ion a dazzling show in the early mornings of July, 2020. The comet was so bright, when it was just barely above the horizon, it was an obvious sight from this moderately dark location at this 10,770 foot elevation dark site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. It was a beautiful sight in 7x50 binoculars as it rose higher in the sky, with a tail about 4 degrees long (visually), or 8 diameters of the full Moon. \r\n\r\nThis image was obtained with a stock Canon EOS 90D Camera and Canon 300 mm f/2.8 L IS II lens at f/2.8. Tracking the comet with an Astrotrac, the image is a stack of 55 images. Forty nine 4-second exposures at ISO 800 were stacked for the tails (3.27 minutes total exposure), and 6 images of the comet head with exposures from 1/10 to 0.6 second were combined for a High Dynamic Range (HDR) composite to show detail in from the green nucleus to the faint dust and ion tails. The field of view of the image is 3.9 x 2.8 degrees.",
