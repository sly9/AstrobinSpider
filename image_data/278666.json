    "description": "The Raspberry nebula is in the center.( SH2-263 is the red emission nebula and VDB38 is the blue reflection nebula.) The central star is HD34989.  To the right is SH2-265 and lower left shows a section of the Lambda Orionis ring SH2-264. The blue light from the star Bellatrix \"shines\" from the lower right.\r\n\r\nImage dates: 24,25,26,27 and 28 december 2016\r\nThis is enough data so i could use only basic processing in PI: DBE, HistogramTransformation, a little SCNR to remove green and a little curves adjustment. So no BackgroundNeutralisation, no ColorCorrection, no Noise reduction etc.  \r\n\r\nISO 1600 was used.",
