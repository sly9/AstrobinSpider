    "description": "Another free DSW data set--this time from the FSQ 106 located in the Atacama Desert in Chile.  This image includes Ha LRGB.  I initially added 10 hours of my own Ha data to the image but it was of no benefit, mostly because the framing was off.  I was surprised to see very little difference between my Ha stack collected from my backyard and the Ha stack collected by DSW.  Then again, Ha is much less impacted by conditions than is broadband.\r\n\r\nDespite the quality of the data, I would much prefer processing my own.  But hey, that's not an option until conditions improve.",
