    "description": "\r\nWith bad viewing, just by calling for an Ir pass filter. In the case I used a 685 nm wavelength filter to highlight Jupiter's bands and zones, what I did not expect was that I would get such good details on Ganymede with a poor seeing.\r\nYou can see perfectly the stain at 1pm which corresponds if I do not angano the region of Galileo Regio. The Osiris crater below 5 o'clock also stood out easily due to its intense brightness.\r\nTo avoid doubts follow the projection made through the Virtual Planet Atlas that I was kindly indicated by the great friend Carlos Ayres.",
