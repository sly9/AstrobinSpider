    "description": "A reprocess of the propeller Nebula, with enough of a change in track to warrant a new posting.  From pallet to orientation its new.  I love the dark structures in this area.  I found this a bit tricky to process as the dynamic range between the target and the surrounding region is quite high.  If one is not careful, much of the delicate background structure is lost below the threshold of seeing.",
