    "description": "This image is about 16 hours of LRGB data @ 180s exposures.\r\nIt's also a reprocess (with much-improved processing skills) of my previous image. The previous version was actually my first image uploaded to Astrobin and also a fatality to the data loss, so I felt that I needed to honor it with a reprocess:)",
