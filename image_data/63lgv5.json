    "description": "The Herculues Galaxy Cluster! All of these galaxies are magnitude 13+, with most being in the 14-16 range. They are quite faint. I had to do a lot of work to remove the noise, although there are still some oddities left.\r\nNGC 6050 is quite the showpiece, just down from center. It contains three galaxies, all clearly visible, interacting with each other. There are several other interacting galaxies, some with disturbed spirals, massive regions of triggered star formation, rings, and gravitational \"slingshot\" plumes. There is even a polar jet (lower left)! It is quite a busy field of galaxies.",
