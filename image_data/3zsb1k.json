    "description": "Subframes taken from 2019 Nov. ~ Dec., in Lijiang, China.\r\nHa: 15min x 34\r\nOIII: 15min x 39\r\nRed: 5min x 30\r\nGreen: 5min x 32\r\nBlue: 5min x 36\r\n\r\nMainly in RGB, with 30% Ha to enhance some details. When finished, adding OIII to Blue (more) and Green (less). \r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of this image is that an Olll filter was used to bring out the doubly ionized oxygen in the outer reaches of the Fox Fur Nebula . The use of the Olll filter is responsible for the electric blue color but should not be confused with the dust surrounding S Mon at the center which also photographs blue.",
