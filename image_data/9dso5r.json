    "description": "The Triangulum Galaxy (Messier 33 or NGC 598) is located 2.7 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Triangulum. It has a diameter of about 60,000 light-years and is classified as a spiral type galaxy. The Triangulum Galaxy is the third-largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, behind the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. All three are members of the Local Group containing about 50 galaxies.\r\nThe galactic nucleus is composed of a cloud of gas and dust and also contains an ultraluminous X-ray source. The hydrogen gas is ionized by luminous, massive stars. Blue-colored regions scattered at the spiral arms of the Triangulum Galaxy are the prime regions for star formation especially of short-lived but very massive stars. Recent research indicates that Triangulum galaxyâ€™s star formation rate is several folds higher than Andromeda galaxy.",
