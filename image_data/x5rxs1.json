    "description": "I have imaged Comet NEOWISE for almost 3 weeks straight in July from my observatory on Anarchist Mountain in BC. with lots of technical support from my husband Peter. The comet is disappearing from view now and that makes me sad somehow. But, I have 17 nights of data to process! The image on the left was captured on July 11, soon after it appeared from it's trip close to the Sun and the green fuzzball on the right was taken on July 26. Both were taken with the exact same equipment and processing steps and are the same image scale. These close-in photos are from my 2700mm focal length setup. I intend to put all 17 images together to show the evolution of this dazzling comet.\r\n\r\nEach image is 60 frames x 6 seconds for each RGB filter.",
