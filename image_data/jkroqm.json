    "description": "Glowing at more than 170,000 light years from earth, the Large Magellanic Cloud is part of the Southern Heavenly Heritage.\r\n\r\nThis dwarf satellite galaxy of the Milky Way is populated with vivid nebulae rich in hot young stars. Here is the Northwest region with spectacular nebulae around the star cluster NGC1761 in the lower right part of the image. There is also a very strong stellar activity here, numerous star formations within regions richer in oxygen (in blue), beautiful clusters and garlands of stars.\r\nWe can also easily see two relatively compact globular clusters but also a number of smaller ones. Finally, at the top left corner, the remains of a well-marked blue remnant supernova quietly scatter\r\n\r\nDynamic narrowband combination using Sii, Ha,Oiii and RGB layers",
