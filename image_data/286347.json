    "description": "M51 The Whirlpool Galaxy taken from Foresthill with excellent springtime seeing conditions.  At this location before the summer heat causes turbulence, the seeing in the spring can be 1 arc second due to the thermal equilibrium of the air.\r\nI know this was taken with an RCOS 14.5\" f/8 Classical Cassegrain but not sure about the camera ... it was either an SBIG 11K or a QSI 8300 ... I had both at the time.  We took about 30 luminance subs and discarded any that were in any way blurry ... lots of clear nights in the spring. Processed with CCDStack and PS CS 5 and plugins like Noise Ninja.",
