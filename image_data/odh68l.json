    "description": "Finally found a short clearing to add a bit more data to what I collected last month.\r\n\r\nMy main reference was Adam Block's with 28 hours of Ha in a 32\"... \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.caelumobservatory.com/gallery/m82.shtml\">Adam Block 32-inch HaLRGB: 28H:8.3H:1.7H:1.7H:1.7H </a>\r\n\r\nWhat you see here is HaLRB: 6.7H:3.7H:1.2H:2H.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the weather turned before I could get G, so I used G = .8B + .2R.\r\n\r\nInteresting to note that 6.7 hours of Ha didn't really have much more structure than 3.7 hours of L. I included the Ha for the \"starburst\" color effect that seems so popular.",
