    "description": "Hi ! Thank you for watching my version of the Wishing Well Cluster\r\n\r\nThis open cluster is famous in the southern hemisphere. These bright blue and red giants are a pleasure to watch visually in my small CFF 105 refractor.\r\n\r\nI probably spent too much integration time on this kind of target but I have no regrets.\r\nI was surprised and happy to grab so many tiny stars in the background even if I knew I was shooting in the milky way. Ha emission is barely visible in the RGB version and revealed with 7nm Ha filter.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this image and had a chance to look at this cluster in a telescope.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\n\r\nYE",
