    "description": "This has been a tough target for me. I have tried to shoot it from my backyard and failed badly. The position is not ideal for the mount and guiding suffers. Its position low in the sky usually results in soupy subs. \r\n\r\nI was hoping that it will be better in Marathon. It is -  but not as much as I was expecting. Again, with non-optimal setup, the stars were bloated and tough guiding resulted in a lot of bad stars. The gear is shared with Dhaval Brahmbhatt in Marathon (MaRIO)\r\n\r\nEven though I shot a lot of subs and threw away 2/3 of them to get some usable sub. The resolution in the dust lane isnt as much as I was expecting. \r\n\r\nI also resorted to <gasp> software star spikes (using a trial version of StarSpikes Pro  4)... I couldn't handle more of the bloated foreground stars :-) I really should just 3dprint a vane for the dewshield to add spikes!\r\n\r\nShot 230x5 L and only could use 68x5 L subs :(\r\nR/G/B is about 12x5 (out of 30x5 that I shot for each)",
