    "description": " Slightly too late for Halloween, I have gathered 6 hours of RGB and 2 hours of Ha (may get some more tonight between mist and fireworks) for a deliberately moody look at these two delicate (and quite ethereal to my eye) nebula near to the bright beacon of Gamma Cass.  I have let myself loose a little with colour as the nebula are in such a beautiful star field.\r\n\r\nControl of Gamma Cass is key, but you have to let it bloom a little to make it look realistic - well that's my excuse ;-).\r\n\r\nI'm changing to my FSQ85 tomorrow with its new FT 3\" focuser . . . \r\n\r\nRevision B: a little more NR\r\n\r\nThanks for looking & clear skies!",
