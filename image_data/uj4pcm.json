    "description": "The Fishhead nebula is situated in Cassiopeia, at around 6000 ly and is situated close to the Heart nebula. It spans around 70 ly. (Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nMy first completed project in 2021. I actually started the acquisitions in December 2020, but due to bad weather it took more than a month to complete. I had to throw a lot of O3 frames and also I had to crop the integrated masters due to a camera rotation (I forgot to tighten the OAG when screwing in the filter wheel ...). \r\n\r\nAcquisition from Dec 16th 2020 to Jan 20th 2021, over 6 nights.",
