    "description": "Simeis 147 (Sharpless 2-240) is a supernova remnant that is 3,000 light years away on the border of the constellations of Taurus and Auriga.  It has a diameter of around 150 light years, which, at that distance, covers around 3 degrees of the night sky.  It is estimated that the parent star went supernova around 40,000 years ago.  The nebula is sometimes referred to as the Spaghetti Nebula.  \n\nThis is a 6 panel mosiac captured between 9 March 2019 and 16 February 2021 by Barry Wilson and me from our widefield imaging rig in Spain.  Capture details are as follows: \n\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\nCamera: QSI 683\nFilters: Astrodon\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\n\nHa: 126 x 1200s\nRed: 144 x 300s\nGreen: 144 x 300s\nBlue: 144 x 300s\n\nA total of 78 hours exposure.\n\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\nProcessing: Steve Milne",
