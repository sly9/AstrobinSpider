    "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nLast Thursday, coming back home from a little business trip, I stopped in a little town to take a picture of the ISS which was supposed to cross the sky at 19h23.\r\nThere are 36 images, taken with an A7III and Tamron 17-28 at 17mm and f5.6.\r\nNext time I will go to a darker place, there is a lot of light pollution there.\r\n\r\nEdit : version 2 of the image with less compression and better resolution.\r\n\r\nDavid",
