    "description": "I've been spending quite a bit of time processing this data to try and achieve the best I can from it. not entirely happy with the result here still but a work in progress.\r\n\r\nIt's the first image series having moved my telescope to a new remote and dark sky location, so am learning what is normal. The dark skies has lead to fainter detail coming out in the galaxy than I am used to, at least I think so.\r\n\r\nThe defined edge(s) to the galaxy top right are surprising and somethin I am working on to ensure they are not an artefact. I have to wonder if there is some form of posterization however all data is being processed in 32bit and best I can tell, be it in PixInsight or CCDStack, the lines appear from the raw data, but are only evident in a stack due to the faint nature.\r\n\r\nI have significant RGB data but have not been happy with any renditions of that so far.",
