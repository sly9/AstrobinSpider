    "description": "A Saturn with good resolution, bands and easily visible Hexagon polarity, clear Cassini division and some traces of Encke's division. Ring C quite distinct in the photo on the IR as well as the eye of the polar tornado. My greatest wish would be for Saturn to have all that atmospheric activity we can see on Jupiter, if one is already good, two would be too much!",
