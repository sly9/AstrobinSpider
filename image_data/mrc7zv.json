    "description": "It very rarely happens that we 've got 9 nights in a row  (around new Moon!) here in Belgium. Next to the main setup I have put the little SharpStar to use to capture every night 10-minute frames of this area. Even with the Optolong LPS the large field gave a clear gradiÃ«nt of light pollution. \r\n\r\nSeeing the tail appear after 145 frames made me smile :-)\r\nSo yes it's possible to capture this feature in SQM 20 type skies, you only need a lot of patience I guess (or a faster scope).\r\n\r\nAlso - you get so focussed on clearing that tail - that forget to protect the galaxies during processing. So I guess I need to re-reprocess taking that into account.",
