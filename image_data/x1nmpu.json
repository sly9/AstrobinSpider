    "description": "This was a rare opportunity to catch something special from the Westport Observatory. Most interesting events are clouded out in Connecticut. I think it's a state law. This was the day before the comet's closest approach, but I'll take it. Comet processing gives me fits, so it took a while to get around to working on the shot, and it's still a little too contrasty for my taste. I added some data  from the 14\" EdgeHd scope for more details on the two galaxies, but it didn't make a huge difference at this scale.\r\n\r\nI neglected to recheck my focus, and the Takahashi drifts a lot with temperature changes, so I was lucky it didn't shift TOO badly.",
