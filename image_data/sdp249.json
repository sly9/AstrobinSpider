    "description": "A single shot of the Tarantula nebula taken at the end of the night after spending time unsuccessfully trying to get OAG focused (was more successful the following night).  Attempted to reduce the noise, but had some trouble with colouring of star centres, possibly due to being new to arcsinh stretching etc. \r\n\r\nJpg straight from camera included for comparison. Obviously you can see more faint nebula details in the processed image, but I currently prefer the jpg itself for overall image. I think perhaps I need to start looking into star reduction.",
