    "description": "M27, the Dumbbell Nebula is so big and bright that it's a favorite object for anyone starting off in astrophotography, but that doesn't mean that it's necessarily an easy target.  It has a super bright core and a lot of interesting faint wisps from the cosmic shock waves radiating outside the main core.  Between bad weather and travel, I started this project back in June with one available night for taking data. M27 is very bright and I figured that I'd only shoot two NB colors so it seemed possible. Unfortunately, the wind made the conditions challenging and I didn't get enough good data so I had to go back for a second night.  I found that its brightness make it a VERY difficult object to process in narrow band. My first processing attempt back in June was a disaster so I put it aside. Over the last few months I've made a number of attempts to get something acceptable and each time, I gave up in defeat. Finally, I had to ditch my preconceived notions of how to process a bi-color image and began to experiment with different ideas--most of which didn't work. With constant cloudy weather, I finally had a chance to fool with it again and this time, I started to wrestle it under control. I've got eight directories on my disk with different attempts but I think that I must have produced at least a dozen different versions along the way. M27 is pretty easy with a DSLR in RGB but it's on my list of top-10 hard to process narrow band objects.  As always, C&C is welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n- John\r\nOctober 25, 2016",
