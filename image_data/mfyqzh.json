    "description": "This region near the border of Cassiopeia and Cepheus begs a question.  What it is, I'm not sure, but thought it was an interesting combination of nebulosity.  At its core is NGC7822, a young star forming region that lies some 2900 light years away. This region has one of the hottest known close stars with a surface temperature of 45000K and luminosity at around 100000 times that of our Sun.  \r\n\r\nNear the bottom, punctuating this region, is Sh2-170, a small emission nebula often labeled as the Little Rosette Nebula.  It lies some 7500 light years away, more distant than the foreground star forming region of NGC7822.\r\n\r\nCheck out the annotations for more details and the crops of each of the selected regions.",
