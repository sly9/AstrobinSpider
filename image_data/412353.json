    "description": "Being able to visit a supreme deepsky site is a rare and special privilege, and I am grateful to Faried Abu-Salih who is about to establish new astronomical life on Rooisand farm, which is some kilometers past Hakos farm on C26 road in Namibia. At 1300m height its a little bit warmer than Hakos, sky and lodging is about perfect as it can be. The Lacerta team was invited to come as one of the first guests and we were happy to have 10 out of 10 nights with clearest skies, and some with superior seeing conditions. Thank you Faried!\r\n\r\nI was working like mad using 4 cameras on 3 mounts and got a total of 49 projects done, and here is the first one, M83 the southern pinwheel - a must to any photographer going south. The barred spiral is loaded with detail and pretty HII knots. On the full field there is a very faint stellar stream visible to left, which is roughly to the north.\r\n\r\n10\"f4 Newton on CGE mount, ASI1600MMP, pure LRGB with Astronomik filters.",
