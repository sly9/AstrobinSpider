    "description": "I took this image using the remote set up at e-Eye. I think what I needed was some longer RGB subs, as the ones I used were only 5 minutes long each. I have processed it to within its limits, and it is a little grainy close up, but I am pleased with this as I have never imaged this object before. I took 40 luminance subs at 600s long each, plus 20 subs in red and green, and 17 subs in blue, each at 300s. Total integration time was: 11hrs 25 mins.",
