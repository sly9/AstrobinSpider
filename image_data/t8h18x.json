    "description": "First I want to apologize to 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) for ignoring it for 45 years. But now it has caught my interest.  For this integrated image I grabbed more data then might be sanely expected.\r\n\r\nThe processing of 47 Tucanae is very tricky because the core is very bright.  Then, at some point, I became obsessed with doing justice to the background galaxy, PGC&nbsp;1536 at magnitude +16.5 and 0.7 x 0.1 arcmin size, among the mass of outer stars.  Also just in the frame, the other galaxy is PGC&nbsp;262873, which is magnitude +17.8 and 0.2 x 0.2 arcmin size.\r\n\r\n(Note that there is some issue with the automatic astrometry as the correct resolution should be 0.644 arcsec/pixel.)",
