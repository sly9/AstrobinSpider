    "description": "From my Bortle 8 skies, bright star clusters are about the only things I can image in LRGB. So I often repeat targets in this class, and Omega Centauri is one I go back to when conditions are right. The current image is the result of 160 1-minute Lum subexposures, under very good seeing, combined with the color data of an image I did last year. I tried to emphasize the star colors, so that they are easy to appreciate all the way to the center of the core of the cluster.\r\n\r\nAPOD 2021-06-03",
