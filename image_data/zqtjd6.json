    "description": "I took advantage of an unusually transparent night to grab an early shot of Andromeda from my yard, and it may be my best one yet despite the relatively short exposure time. There aren't many targets I can capture through the trees here, but M31 just happens to be well placed, and having the telescope aligned in hibernate mode provided an early start.",
