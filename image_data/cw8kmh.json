    "description": "This  is my attempt at the Elephant's Trunk Nebula IC1396A in the constellation Cepheus, one of my favorite DSOs. \r\nThe weather has been terrible here in Southern Germany over the last couple fo weeks, so this took me longer than expected, but I am quite happy how it turned out. I am looking forward to more large narrowband summer targets!",
