    "description": "This is the only the third image that I've completed using my new \"Final Frontier Telescope\". It is a combination of just over 10 hours of subframes, which were shot between mid-July and mid-August of this year (260 minutes luminance and 350 minutes RGB, all un-binned). I reduced the image size for final presentation by 75%, since collimation and mount tracking had not yet been fully optimized when the raw subs were acquired. The final plate scale is about 0.62\"/pixel, and the angular image size after cropping is about 28' x 30'.",
