    "description": "(If you enjoy seeing these images, please follow me.)\n\nFew places in the sky show off clouds of dust, stars and galaxies like this field near NGC 7497.\nI acquired and processed this image nearly a decade ago. No starnet++ , no HDR ... just the bare \nprocessing methods of the day. PixInsight had just gotten onto my radar here, I used it just for DBE. \nI have personally always been proud of this image. It never really got much attention, but the dust is \nseriously intense here!",
