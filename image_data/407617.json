    "description": "Messier 20, the Trifid Nebula, is a stunningly beautiful deep-sky object consisting of red emission, blue reflection, and dark nebulosity. The dark nebula which forms the three prominent dust lanes is Barnard 85.\r\nM20 is located in the constellation of Sagittarius a degree and a half north-northwest from M8, the Lagoon Nebula.\r\nThe Trifid is only 300,000 years old and is a star forming region. A hot young star in the center illuminates the nebula.\r\nM20 lies 9,000 light-years away, and subtends an apparent angle of 20 arcminutes, which corresponds to a true size of 30 light-years in space. It shines at magnitude 6.3.\r\n\r\n\r\nASI071MC-PRO\r\nGAIN=90\r\nOFFSET=20\r\n30 X 300s",
