    "description": "The California Nebula is one of our nearest neighbors at approximately 1500 ly away.  This image frames the middle of the nebula, only a part of its 100 ly length. The most likely candidate for the irradiating star is Xi Persei, the prominent star at the top.  \r\n\r\nImage was calibrated and integrated in PI, post processed in PS, combined in PI and final colors and adjustments were made in PS.\r\n\r\nWeb sites:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.stellarsolace.com/\">StellarSolace</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StellarSolace-1588021434610921/\">Facebook page</a>",
