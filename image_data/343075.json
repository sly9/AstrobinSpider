    "description": "I was wondering whether I should share this image here or not. It was captured in very chalenging conditions, with lots of clouds and cirrus that severely decreased SNR. Furthermore, it was more of a test, and very quick - only 33 minutes integration. I was experimenting with my new-at-the-time Samyang 135mm. The result is my best Pleiades thus far (mainly because October-January is the rainy period here in Brazil), but still far from what I'd like to accomplish. Finally, I decided to share, as I like to share both the successes, and the (relative) failures or challenges.\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism, comments and suggestions are more than welcome in the comments section. Thank you for taking your time to look at this image.\r\n\r\nTaken from Rural Skies (Bortle 3-4; SQM ~20.8*calculated), from MG, Brazil (22ºS latitude).\r\n\r\nDate and Time: December 23, 2017\r\nCamera: Canon EOS 80D (unmodded), at ISO 800\r\nLens: Samyang 135mm f/2.0, operated at f/2.4\r\nMount: Sky-Watcher HEQ5, tracking, guided \r\nGuiding: Starguider 50mm Guidescope + ASI120mm + PHD2; ~1.7\" RMS\r\nExposure Detail: 11x180s (total 33min)",
