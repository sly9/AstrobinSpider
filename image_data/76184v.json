I've used up all my astro luck now, gonna be cloudy for weeks, or guiding freaks out, whatever, I don't care. Was a 100kn ride to the spot,  prepared for Murphy's law to not to be too disappointed, but here it is.\n\nISS footprints are the single frames from the transit, Sun is stacked from the same clip.\n\nBest regards,\nMichael",
