    "description": "Steve and I began this collaboration on the 1st February when I captured the first RGB subs, then we have haltingly acquired the data whenever conditions allowed: Steve the Luminance and Ha, me the RGB, all binned 1 x 1. It was important to capture all the data during the best seeing - not the best winter for that as we all know - however, especially the RGB at the maximum altitude too, which meant much later in the evening, often when Devon was clouding out. So it wasn't until Saturday 2nd April that I could finally capture the last few RGB subs having discarded one hour of each for poor seeing. Steve had a slow start with poor weather but had a burst of speed towards the end of March with a few clear nights on the trot. It was exciting sharing the calibrated data - and we were both delighted to see the results.\r\n\r\nMessier 63 has relatively low surface brightness and has recently shown some interesting tidal and halo features - need big scope and dark skies to reveal these. We are both very pleased to have captured the distinctive clumpy texture and rich colouring. Processing required delicate treatment for some elements and some brutish welly for others to help coax the subject out from the background. Details: Scopes & CCDs - SW Esprit 120mm with QSI690 and WO FLT132 with QSI683 both at F7 Mounts - Mesu 200 and 10 Micron GM1000HPS Filters - Astrodon Software - we both use the magnificent SGP, PI and PS Data - 36 x 600s Lum; 16 x 60s Lum; 11 x 1200s Ha; 13 x 600s each R, G and B. Total integration a shade over 16hrs.\r\n\r\nThis is my processed version, completely done in PI.\r\n\r\nThank you once again to Steve for good humour, patience, a sense of wonder and fun.",
