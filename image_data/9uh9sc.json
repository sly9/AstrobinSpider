    "description": "With these cloudy winter months here in Michigan, I decided to take a stab at a starless version of S2-96; part of a giant super nova remnant. In this image you will see a black and white thumbnail of the complete remnant in the upper right corner with a red framing of what my framing achieved. The thumbnail used was captured by Dave Erickson back in 2015. \r\n\r\nSharpless-96 (Sh2-96) is part of a giant ancient super nova remnant designated G65.3+5.7 located in the constellation Cygnus the Swan approximately 2500 light-years distant. This portion, Sh2-96, however is the most interesting part to me. Other parts include designations of Sh2-91 and Sh2-94, which are out of the field of view. Because of how old and dispersed the nebulosity is, it is very faint. I did not pick up any nebulosity in a single sub. I had to really massage the data to get where I wanted it. It reminds me of CTB-1 (Abell 85) meets the Veil Nebula, which makes sense because they are super nova remnants as well.",
