    "description": "So happy we finally got a few frames on this little interesting guy. It looks so much like a planetary nebula, I was left scratching my head when I read it was an emission. \r\n\r\nTried to make the palette look a bit more like an SHO palette rather than HOO. Think it came out rather nice for not having Sii in it as well.",
