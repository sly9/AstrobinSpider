    "description": "Quick shot of 20 times 120\" shots RGB each with a small surprise. \r\n\r\nThe red green blue trails are the minor planets moving relative to the stars and shot through the corresponding filter. Cartes du Ciel revealed them as (1342) Brabantia and (4292) Aoba.\r\n\r\nActually there seems to be a third one in the upper middle part of the image. Very faint RGB trail but I couldn't find anything on that one at that time. I must have been lucky to having pointed at a busy spot in the belt.",
