    "description": "* Image acquisition by <a href=\" http://www.astrobin.com/users/wes63/ \"> Wes Higgins </a> (Ha) and Jim Misti (RGB). \r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n\r\nThe Helix Nebula is a large planetary nebula located in the constellation Aquarius. Tthis object is one of the closest to the Earth of all the bright planetary nebulae. The estimated distance is about 700 light-years. \r\n\r\nIt is similar in appearance to the Cat's Eye Nebula and the Ring Nebula, whose size, age, and physical characteristics are similar to the Dumbbell Nebula, varying only in its relative proximity and the appearance from the equatorial viewing angle. The Helix Nebula has sometimes been referred to as the \"Eye of God\" in pop culture, as well as the \"Eye of Sauron\".\r\n\r\nThe Helix Nebula is an example of a planetary nebula, formed by an intermediate to low-mass star, which sheds its outer layers near the end of its evolution. Gases from the star in the surrounding space appear, from our vantage point, as if we are looking down a helix structure. The remnant central stellar core, known as a planetary nebula nucleus, is destined to become a white dwarf star. The observed glow of the central star is so energetic that it causes the previously expelled gases to brightly fluoresce.",
