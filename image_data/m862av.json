    "description": "NGC 6872 is a very large spiral galaxy located between 220 and 300 million light years from here in Pavo. Size estimates very somewhat with an average estimate of 700,000 light years across,  as do distance estimates but it may be the largest known spiral galaxy.  The galaxy is interacting with IC 4970 which accounts for the unusual shape.\nImaged in LRGB on our CDK 1000 at El Sauce, Obstech, Chile\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\nhttps://www.facebook.com/masterdarksastro/",
