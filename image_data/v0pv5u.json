    "description": "Also known as NGC 4258, it is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici, the Hunting Dogs. \r\n\r\nM106 is at a distance of about 22 to 25 million light-years away from Earth and a spatial diameter of 135,000 light years. It is similar in size and luminosity to the Andromeda Galaxy.\r\n\r\nThis galaxy contains an active nucleus classified as a Type 2 Seyfert, and the presence of a central supermassive black hole has been demonstrated from radio-wavelength observations of the rotation of a disk of molecular gas orbiting within the inner light-year around the black hole.\r\n\r\nSource: Wikipedia\r\n\r\nI am still getting the hang of the new rig. I've actually chosen M106 as it is the only one with a guidestar in the OAG field of view, without doing any rotations, as I was imaging the Headphone Nebula around the same time. I am replacing my guidecam with a more sensitive one.\r\n\r\nI am happy how this turned out, despite always wishing for an OSC when doing broadband.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your comments and especially, your feedback!\r\n\r\nClear skies and stay safe!",
