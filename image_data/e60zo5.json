    "description": "Each year I like to add more data to some of my images. This time of year it's M33. The addition on this image is one night of Olll, seeing if I could bring out some of the more subtle blue color in the emission nebula.\r\n\r\nAnd apparently it worked. The primary image is HOLRGB. As you roll-over M33 you will see the HLRGB image with no added color from the Olll image. The changes are subtle, but they are there.\r\n\r\nYou might say that some of these color changes are groups of mostly blue stars. But look closely. Much of enhanced blue is directly associated with the red  of the H emitting emission nebula. In any case this seemed like an interesting experiment. Hope you like it.",
