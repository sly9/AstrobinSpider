    "description": "The region of Moretus is one of my favourites, some hills in the horizon, make the sight even more spectacular. This hills are very close to the Lunar South Pole.\r\n\r\nBetween them and Moretus, we can see the crater Newton, the deepest crater of the Moon, its inner wall reaches 8.000m. If we throw a stone from the top of the wall, it takes several minutes to get the crater's floor!\r\n\r\nGiven its location, the sunlight, almost never reaches the Newton's floor, except when librations are favorable, so in this crater, night is almost perpetual.\r\n",
