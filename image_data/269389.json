    "description": "\r\nWhen Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin first came to the then unknown soil satellite, promptly made the surprising discovery that the lack of atmosphere makes the shadows there are much darker than those of here. When put their feet into a shadow, they were completely invisible, even with the sun pounding on their heads.\r\nAlthough they soon noticed that his eyes could adjust to darkness, the contrast between the light and shaded remained strong. Things only got stranger when they realized that their own shadows were luminous contours caused by the opposite effect (the fact that they found later) - a phenomenon that causes black areas appear surrounded by bands of light when viewed at a certain angle Sun.\r\nShadows of the Moon caused problems in many of the Apollo missions. Some astronauts were unable to perform their maintenance tasks because their own hands blocking the light, while others were confused thinking it would land on a steep slope and hit the floor without light, which looked like a deep cave.\r\nSource: Mega Curious",
