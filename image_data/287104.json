    "description": "The usual weather conditions and some issues with my mount stopped me from catching more light. The image is somewhat hyper-colored and a bad SNR (i had to limit my lights to 120s) led to massive denoising. The issues with my mount should be solved (I 'hypertuned' it this weekend) an now all i have to to is to wait for some dark and cloudless nights to collect more lights. Here is a preview of this beauty.",
