    "description": "Abell36 is a planetary nebula that lies in the constellation of Virgo some 780 light years away.\r\n \r\nIt is very dim, not having much signal above the background sky. The 7 minute sub time that I used is longer than I usually like to go but it was necessary to bring out the nebula.\r\n\r\nThe nebula has formed from the central blue star. The star is blowing off its outer layers as it transforms to a dwarf star.\r\n\r\nLocation: Terip Terip, Victoria, Australia\r\nDate: 21 April 2018\r\nOptics: AG Optical Systems 12.5&quot; iDK, \r\nFocal length 2121 mm\r\nCamera: mono ML16200 with a Loadstar X2 on an Astrodon MOAG off-axis guider.\r\nAcquisition: Software: Sequence Generator Pro\r\nLRGB 7mins per sub: 23:13:17:12\r\nAstrodon Gen II filters\r\nSensor temp: -30",
