    "description": "I think this is one of the prettiest galaxies to image but it had its challenges. Located near the bright Big Dipper star Phecda ― the bottom corner of the bowl closest to the Dipper’s “handle” . I had to offset it in the acquisition and later crop the image a little as Phecda caused a lot of streaking in the top right corner. It is 60 million light-years away and belongs to the Ursa Major galaxy group. It hosts a trillion stars, many of which are young blue giants.",
