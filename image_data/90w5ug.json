    "description": "Panorama obtained from three panels.\r\nOne of the most famous murted lunar plains Clavius (225 km) is the major formation on this view. To its left, a closed plain Maginus (163 km) and at the top of the image another beautiful walled plain, Longomontanus (145 km).\r\nIn this composition, I sought to give the image of intensity, realism by playing on several areas:\r\n- The weak turbulence allowed me to grasp more fine details and thus significantly increase its size,\r\n- On the other hand, the shaving light on this area close to the terminator, gives a harder and more dramatic appearance,\r\n- Finally, the chosen orientation  also amplifies the sensation of 3D by the fact that the image begins with the imposing Clavius, to slide gradually on the lunar horizon.",
