    "description": "Taken the 11th of July 2020.    The northeastern limb of Mare Imbrium.   I took the liberty of labeling certain features, the most prominent one is the lava filled crater Plato that ranges  100km (60mile) across.    As noted, shadows are long as you can see the terminator on the right side.   Yes, I tried to brighten it up a bit without blowing it out.   Photo taken with a CGE11, at focus (no Barlow), with a QHY5III178M camera, best 400 of 4000 frames acquired in Firecapture, processed Autostakert 3, and then \"tweaked\"in PS-CC.",
