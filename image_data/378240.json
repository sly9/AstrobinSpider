    "description": "I captured this image during a night with good transparency and seeing back in May. This planetary combines size (about 2.5 arc minutes) with exceptional brightnesss. Its a pretty easy target visually and large enough to easily get a good image. The seeing here allowed me to get a better look at the faint dust lanes that form a cross across its disk and pick out some of the structure in the red regions of the nebula. The star images are a little odd - I think I may have been a little out of collimation. Oh well.",
