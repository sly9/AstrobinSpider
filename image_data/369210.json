    "description": "NGC7048 - Planetary Nebula in Cygnus . This is a bicolor image (Shot with two filters - Ha and OIII and mapped to RGB). The reds are Ha data and Blues are from the OIII.\r\nThe planetary nebula is formed near the end of a lower mass star life (much like our Sun) where outer layers are ejected and ionized (resulting in emission nebula around the star).\r\n\r\nThis summer has been pretty poor for astrophotography due to weather and equipment issues. This is only 2 hours per channel (8x15 minute subs).",
