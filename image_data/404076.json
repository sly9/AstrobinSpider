Processed to exaggerate the faint IFN and with high resolution data of M81 and M82 blended in using the data from our second rig at e-Eye, the TEC140 with QSI690 (previously uploaded as a mosaic) which comprises 56 hours of integration.\r\n\r\nData acqusition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
