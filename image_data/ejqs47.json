    "description": "IC2944 is a well known circumpolar object in the southern hemisphere. It can be found in the constellation of Centaurus, with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.5.   You will find it nestled between the Southern Cross and Carina area.  It’s a large structure spanning around 75 arcmin.   Other names include The Running Chicken Nebula, RCW 62, and G42.   No matter how hard I try, I just can’t see the chicken, maybe a bird in flight?\r\n\r\nThis rendition is a narrowband Bi-Colour base with RGB stars.  My intent was to present an image approximating the more traditional RGB look and feel while using narrowband data as the base.   Ha filtered light was used in the red channel.  OIII filtered light in the green and blue channels without any weighting applied.  \r\n\r\nA fascinating feature would have to be the very dark areas in the nebula.  These are known as Bok globules, small dark nebula containing dense dust and gas.  Usually found in H II regions, they are areas of partially ionized interstellar atomic hydrogen.  These globules are now known as Thackeray’s Globules, named after the South African astronomer David Thackeray.\r\n\r\nYou may notice a slight brightening on the right side of the photo.  This glow is the halo of Lambda Centauri, a very bright star about 420 light-years from Earth.   With an apparent visual magnitude of +3.13, this halo intrudes into this right side of the image.  \r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\n•\tHa 12 X 1200 Bin1\r\n•\tOIII 22 X 1200 Bin2\r\n•\tRed 8 X 900 Bin1\r\n•\tGreen 8 X 900 Bin1\r\n•\tBlue 8 X 900 Bin\r\n \r\nTotal Time: 17.3 hours\r\n\r\nInstruments\r\n•\tTelescope: 10\" Ritchey-Chrétien RCOS\r\n•\tCamera: SBIG STL-11000 Mono\r\n•\tMount: Astro-Physics AP-900\r\n•\tFocal Length: 2310.00 mm \r\n•\tPixel size: 9.00 um\r\n•\tResolution: 0.82 arcsec/pix\r\n\r\nThanks for looking\r\n\r\nTerry",
