    "description": "A far from perfect image.  My first attempt at Hydrogen-alpha imagery.  Still learning how all this works!  Thi is my first post here. After recently automating my backyard observatory, I can acquire all data from inside the comfort of my house now. This has been a long-term dream come true. After recently getting all observatory systems online and functioning, now I can concentrate on image acquisition. \r\n\r\nI am truly amazed at the incredible amount of fantastic imagery on this site!  I don't know if I will ever be able to compete. The learning curve for PixInsight alone has me feeling down much of the time. But, perhaps there is hope!\r\n\r\nThe Horsehead here is my first \"real\" astro image in that it is my first attempt to put together an image from data, through processing, to a somewhat final image (though I plan on adding many more data frames eventually).  \r\n\r\nI am not happy with the focus, and it is noisy. All criticism is welcomed!  CG",
