    "description": "This animation is inverted from the original mono solar prominence data I captured from 10/10/2019.  I think it shows off the detail even better than my color version.\r\n\r\nThe time space covers a 1 hour and 45 minute period.  There are 169 frames.  Each video was 10 seconds long with 10 second intervals.\r\n\r\nThis animation is running at 30fps playing in forward and reverse.",
