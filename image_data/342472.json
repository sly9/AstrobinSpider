    "description": "NGC 3628 is one of the Leo Triplets. This image shows a tidal stream off to the right, from the gravitational attraction of M65 and M66. The X-shaped bulge in the center of the galaxy suggests it may be a barred spiral with the bar seen end on. There is a small companion galaxy below the main galaxy, and the blue star like dot below this companion is a distant quasar.",
