    "description": "I believe this is, at least technically, the best lunar image that I have managed to put together. Very much derived from exceptional seeing. As a matter of fact it was so good that wanted to have clavius and south pole with exceptional quality...even though I had captured it several times. \r\n\r\nThe \"mountaineus\" region of the south pole amazes me, and with the right light, provides a wonderful 3d sensation. I am very happy about this image. I recommend seeing ar full scale, as it is a mosaic of 5 panels at 4700 FL. \r\n\r\nWorkflow at side-version. I would like to elaborate a better description to pair up with the image, but after a long week I'm afraid I cant think any more english words....\r\n\r\nWish you all a nice astro-weekend!!",
