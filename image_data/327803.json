    "description": "Being so close, M33 presents a nearly unique opportunity to image all of the nebulae of an entire galaxy in one shot.  And some of them are so large they warrant an NGC number of their own!\r\n\r\nThis image started as an Ha capture to enhance my LRGB version of M33.  But the size of the nebulae made me want to complete the image as a narrowband in bi-color.  So I continued to shoot in OIII as well.  48 OIII and 56 Ha subs were used, each 900 sec.  26 hours in total.\r\n\r\nBaader 6nm Ha and Astrodon 3nm OIII.  Planewave CDK14 and SBIG STX 16803.",
