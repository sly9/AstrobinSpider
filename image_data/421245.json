    "description": "A softer Saturn with gentle processing. No barlow/powermate just 2.4µm pixels.  No color re-balance, just straight RGB combine in Photoshop (very surprising).  No de-rotation just living with rotational blurring (the \"Saturn un natural\" version may come later).\r\n\r\nThere were 15 repeats of taking 60 sec R data (@ average 48 fps), 60 sec G data (@ average 48 fps) and 60 sec B data (@ average 38 fps).\r\n\r\nThe motorised focuser made color filter dependent adjustments over a range of 0.57mm (570µm) as the filters are not parfocal at this F ratio. At F/10 the (worse-case) Critical Focus Zone (CFZ) is 200µm. (Previously using a 2.5x barlow the CFZ is over 1000µm and the filters would be parfocal.)\r\n\r\nBecause Saturn is relatively dim then not using a barlow/powermate seems to have given an advantage because more frames can be taken.  Although the performance advantage is not that great.  In contrast, with Jupiter it seems that using a barlow/powermate is better even though it is yields a crazy oversampling factor.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\nScope=LX200GPS\r\nCamera=ZWO ASI183MM Pro\r\nDiameter=18.19\"\r\nMagnitude=0.17\r\nCMI=102.1° CMIII=107.3°  (during mid of capture)\r\nFocalLength=2750mm (F/10)\r\nResolution=0.18\"",
