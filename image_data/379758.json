    "description": "I am very happy about this image of the \"Eye of God\". :-) Viewed from my garden, the maximum height is just 18 degrees above the horizon. I had to photograph exactly over the roofs of my neighbours' houses. Fortunately at the end of September it was still so warm that nobody had the heaters running, so I could take advantage of the very calm air and the great seeing conditions. During four nights I was able to collect 13.5 hours of data.",
