    "description": "The wandering fire , The fire with tongues of flame\r\nWith light there, There kindles quick and clear\r\nThe land forgotten, of long forgotten name\r\nNo man, may ever, may ever anchor near\r\n\r\n- Summoning Band\r\n\r\nI have always Fancied imaging M31, but with all its majesty, it was too big for my imaging system. This year I finally tried a 9 panel (3x3) mosaic on it with 50 hours exposure in my mind. but selling my newt and zwo 1600 left me with only 40 hours, and only 35 hours of it was usable.\r\nThis image has been taken in 8 nights, with 3 different cameras and two different telescopes, in 3 different locations, took 3 days to calibrate and 6 days to process and 2 days to reprocess.\r\nIt has around 700 frames of exposure, and around 300 frames of calibration. The original FOV was wider but I had to crop some of it. hope you enjoy",
