    "description": "(If you enjoy seeing things you have not seen before, please become a follower..thank you!)\r\n\r\nIn mythology Hercules was tasked to clean the Augean Stables, wrestle and capture Cerberus (the many-headed dog that guards the underworld), kill the Stymphalian birds and much more- all of which were very dirty jobs. Apparently when the gods placed him in the sky the dirt and dust came along as well:\r\n\r\nThis is a region of sky near Alpha Herculis (the bright reddish star on the right) which has very faint clouds of dust. The brightest portion near the bottom has no well-known name but is catalogued in the \"Planck Catalogue of Galactic cold clumps.\" While the PCGCC doesn't have a nice ring to it, but the fact it is catalogued hints that this region is filled with molecular clouds of dust and is just outside the region where the more eye-catching nebulae glow brightly with the galactic plane looming nearby.  This is my first IFN cloud (integrated flux) and likely one that hasn't been imaged before? (I honestly do not know, I could not find an example.) I hope you enjoy the subtle view!",
