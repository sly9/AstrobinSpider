    "description": "Active Region AR2192 on October 20, 2014\r\nCovid-19 quarantine edition\r\n\r\nA close look at the Active Region AR2192. This region produced several M-class and X-class solar flares. The entire active region was almost the size of Jupiter.\r\nSunspots are magnetic regions of the Sun with magnetic field strength thousands of times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field. Sunspots usually come in groups with two sets of spots.\r\nSunspots appear as dark spots on the surface of the sun. Temperatures in the dark sunspot centers drop to around 3700 K (compared to 5700 K for the surrounding photosphere). They usually last several days, although very large ones can live for several weeks.\r\n\r\nSee also: \r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/129772/\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/131296/",
