    "description": "I played around with different settings for capturing the disk and prominences. This is my first attempt at combining them into a single image. I used AS2 for stacking both images separately, then sharpened in PI. I couldn't figure out a decent way to combine them in PI, so I loaded the images into Gimp as layers and aligned them by hand.\r\n\r\nLiked the grayscale image. Liked the color version. Going to keep both.",
