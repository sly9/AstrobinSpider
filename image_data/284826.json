    "description": "This mosaic shows the  dark cloud complex Chameleon III\r\n\r\nThe mosaic consists of 2 images, the upper one and the lower one.\r\nIn this dusty area AGN12.20.00 is a reflection nebula. Its declination is strongly Southern (DEC -80), it can be observed exclusively from the regions of the southern hemisphere. AGN12.20.00 reflection nebula is the brightest part of the Chameleon molecular clouds HMSTG458, HMSTG472, HMSTG437 and HMSTG463 in which the phenomena of star formation creating low-mass stars takes place . This clouds are of great importance in the study of the formation of planetary systems and brown dwarfs.\r\nThe right border of this Chameleon III complex touches the left border of the Chameleon I complex which i show in another image of my gallery in Astrobin.\r\n\r\nIC3104 is a galaxy.\r\n                                       \r\nExposures: 33 x 5  minutes with  R-, 29 x 5 with G- and 27 x 5 with B-filters,  in total 7 hours 25 minutes using a SBIG ST11K on a Takahashy FSQ 106 with 530 mm focal length on a Paramount ME mount.\r\n\r\nAll images were exposed remotely on the Siding Spring iTelescop Farm at T12.\r\nThe parts of the mosaic were captured in February and March 2015.",
