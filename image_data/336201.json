    "description": "A quick image of NGC 2282, a neat nebula in the constellation Monoceros.  This image was shot at the Winter Star Party in Feb held in Chiefland FL.  We only had one clear night the entire week so this is sort of short for me.  50min of Luminance, 68min of Red, 60min of Green and 60min of Blue binned 2x2.  This nebula sits within the winter Milky Way and was 90% stars so I cropped it a bit to better highlight the object.",
