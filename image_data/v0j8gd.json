    "description": "NGC 1350 in Fornax at approximately 87,000,000 light-years distance, and roughly 130,000 light years across, is slightly larger than our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Classified as an Sa(r) type galaxy, it has spiral arms wound tightly enough to form a prominent central ring. The faint outer ring (pseudo-ring) is sometimes added to the beginning of the classification with the designation R'1. NGC 1350 is seen on the outskirts of the Fornax cluster of galaxies, but its membership in the group is uncertain due to its distance from them. Many thanks go out to my collaborator and friend, Mike Selby, who acquired and calibrated this fine data.",
