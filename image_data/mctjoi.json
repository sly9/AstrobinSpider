    "description": "Another absolutely stunning target I have always loved that was pretty much inaccessible from the Northern Hemisphere. This target actually reminds me *a lot* of NGC 1333. It's a very dusty area, with a nice reflection nebulae right in the center with a bunch of very faint Ha tendrils hanging out. The main difference though is the stunning star cluster (NGC 6723) which is filled with a unreal combination of colorful stars. Just a treat to sit with this one for hours and process. Dark nebulae have always been a struggle for me, but this target can even make my shoddy processing look decent! \r\n\r\nClear skies!",
