    "description": "After nearly two weeks of poor transparency, it was a welcome change to be able to see the stars again (even if it was between passing clouds).\r\n\r\nSeeing was horrendous for much of the session, to the point where even collimation was a struggle. But for a brief (6 minute) period, the seeing settled and I was able to quickly collect 4 x 2 min decent datasets before more clouds moved in. This is the resulting image.\r\n\r\nGiven how poor the conditions were either side of this brief \"window\", it was a pleasant surprise to see so much detail in the data ... \"lucky imaging\" indeed!",
