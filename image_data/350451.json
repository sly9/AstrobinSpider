    "description": "This is a combination of all the M81 and M82 data collected over the past couple of years. The image was processed to bring out as much of the Integrated Flux Nebula (IFN) as possible. The data from the AP RH scope produced the bright IFN background and the RCOS produced the individual M81 and M82 images that were integrated into the final image.",
