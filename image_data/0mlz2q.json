    "description": "For loving globules, this of course is a favourite object for me.  The zoo of animals you can see, if you want, in them is stunning. I mostly like the jumping cheetah in the middle of the pic. We had some clear nights last week so that I could image again after one month of abstinence. Even it was frozen outside, I was happy to get some nice data with my edge 11 HD. Hope you like it.\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
