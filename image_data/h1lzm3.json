    "description": "The sky has not been quite as transparent the last two nights so this one took two nights due to bad guiding and the colour was much more difficult. I've gone for a 16-9 crop  because I wanted to keep in the little galaxy on the right but not sure if it quite balances. Best viewed bigger as the crop makes the galaxy quite small.\r\n\r\nThe revision attached show my very first attempt at this galaxy - by chance just happens to be 6 years ago to the day.",
