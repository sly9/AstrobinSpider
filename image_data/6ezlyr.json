    "description": "I love gazing at images of the Crab Nebula, especially when Ha has been added to reveal the intricate filiaments within its structure. Still expanding from the bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the Crab Nebula is amazing in RGB or narrowband.\r\n\r\nThis is a LRGB-HOO blended image using data from the following sources:\r\nLRGB - public amateur data from Jim Misti (RC32\", Lum 9x300s, RGB each 3x300s)\r\nHa      - professional data from the Liverpool Telescope (Ha6566, 60x120s)\r\nOIII    - captured from my backyard (24x300s)\r\n\r\nThanks for Looking!",
