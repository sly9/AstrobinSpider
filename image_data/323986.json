    "description": "This is the center of the Heart Nebula acquired in NB and processed in the SHO palette.  The data was acquired in late November 2015.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Nebula\">Heart Nebula</a> (IC 1805, Sharpless 2-190) is an emission nebula about 7500 ly from Earth, located in Cassiopeia and in the Perseus Arm of our galaxy.  There is a small group of stars near the center, an open cluster called Melotte 15 whose radiation is the main source of the nebula's intense red output.  However, here I have rendered in the SHO palette.  Melotte 15 is at center right in my image.\r\n\r\nDespite this data being two years old now, I'm overall pleased with the quality, mostly because I am more forgiving of my abilities from that time.  Now I have a little more skill and a lot more resources to play around with processing the data, and this is my first rendition.  I may return to it again and not remove so much green.  I was hoping to achieve a bit of yellow around the outer rim of the nebula (this would be on the left of my image), but that didn't happen this time.",
