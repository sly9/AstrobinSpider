    "description": "The moon is out so time for NB imaging. The RASA 8 if an f/2 telescope so normal narrowband filters work poorly. So far I have only one of those and I recently collected Ha on this object with the High-speed Baader Ha filter but I am still waiting for the High-speed Baader Oiii filter (apparently in production). Last night in desperation I put on my 8.5 nm Baader Oiii filter to se if I could get anything, and it turned out I got quite a lot of signal, and no annoying reflexes. So here is the result of a Ha-Oiii image of Sh2-119, the less well known nebula just \"to the left\" of the North America Nebula.\r\n\r\nHa in the red channel and Oiii in the blue channel, and I made a synthetic green channel by 50:50 mixing of the Ha and Oiii data. Then I tweeked the colours towards an RGB look. All done in PS except initial calibration and stacking in PI.\r\n\r\nHa: 69 x 5 min. Oiii: 30 x 5 min. Gain 139, offset 50, -20Â°C.",
