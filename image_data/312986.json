    "description": "Here is what the Wiki says about NGC 206. \"NGC 206 is the richest and most conspicuous star cloud in the Andromeda Galaxy as well as one of the largest and brightest star formation regions of the Local Group. It contains more than 300 stars brighter than Mb=âˆ’3.6. It was originally identified by Edwin Hubble as a star cluster but today, due to its size, it is classified as an OB association.\"\r\n\r\nWe put the insert into the image to show its context in M31, a much more familiar target. We want to thank Tim Gillespie for his generous contribution of the M31 image. It's great on its own. Here is that link: <a href=\"/312478\">Tim Gillespie's M31</a>. Take a look.",
