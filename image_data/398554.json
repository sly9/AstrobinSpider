I process it then but was never 100% satisfied with it. I've come back to it a few times but didn't get anything better. I finally decided to just do some minor tweaks and post it as is. M106 was probably my first legitimate AP image back in 2014 with the same scope and my Canon 450D. That image was also taken from my previous house in the heart of the city. My current house is about 2 full magnitudes darker and when combined with my current gear, this image is far superior. I've always loved M106 and the plethora of background galaxies. The annotated version doesn't nearly highlight them all if you look around at full resolution.",
