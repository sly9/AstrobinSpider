    "description": "M82 the \"Cigar Galaxy\"- this is my second approach of processing the Hubble files. These raw files are huge (about 3GB - it's a mosaic of 24 parts) but the resolution is just amazing.\r\n\r\nDid you notice the odd shape at the bottom? Looks like an alien space stationðŸ˜µI saw this on some other Hubble images too. In the M16 image it's in the upper left corner. I wonder what that could be?",
