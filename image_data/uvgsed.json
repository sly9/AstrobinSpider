    "description": "Inspired by Scotty Bishop's wonderful image of this area, I decided to try a wide-field OSC image  of this molecular cloud complex in Chamaeleon.  \r\n\r\nThere aren't many OSC images of this area on Astrobin, and I can see why. The colour balance is critical to deliver a decent image, and an OSC just doesn't quite do there area justice.  \r\n\r\nOr it might just be my post-processing.  \r\n\r\nBut it is still a really interesting area of sky.",
