This type of galaxy is one of the most commonly studied types of galaxies by astronomers. The nucleus of a galaxy has a very high surface brightness and the spectrum contains emission lines with strong ionization. The Seifert galaxy is believed to have the same physical mechanism as a quasar, with a supermassive black hole at its core surrounded by accretion disks and inwardly falling matter. Although such galaxies are no different from common spiral galaxies in the visible light band, their nuclei are very bright when observed in other bands, and their brightness is comparable to galaxies the size of the entire Milky Way.",
