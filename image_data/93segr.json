    "description": "This is a result of a few imaging sessions during August 2020. I was experimenting with different camera gain from 0 to 200. The later comparison of frames make me think that ASI1600 camera gain of 200 is probably works best for my setup. The preprocessing stage was a bit of a challenge, because I have two telescopes and it means I have to manage two sets of data for each session, left alone different camera gain. In order to deal with this issue I had to modify a WBPP, and that allowed me to handle ~1000 files properly. Then the image was processed in PixInsight 1.8.8-6 that comes with build in StarNet tool, which I find very exciting. For the final touches I used Topaz Studio.",
