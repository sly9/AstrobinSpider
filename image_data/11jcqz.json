    "description": "Normally I am not the biggest fan of bicolor images (making them at least) because I always have a tough time with them. SHO images always come out as two colors for me, bicolor generally seems to be even more drastically only two colors. Really tried hard to make this look as little like a bicolor as possible for once though. This is especially true for the stars, very pleased with how close they look to RGB. The Ha was a blast and a half to work with, so much detail hiding in these tendrils! Overall, very happy with how it came out, but don't know if I will take a trip back to the land of bicolor any time soon.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking, and clear skies!",
