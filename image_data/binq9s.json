    "description": "Another nice object from the amazing Sharpless catalog.\r\n\r\nClose to 80 hours of integration time and really surprised by the blue bubble that appears in the middle (not the bright blue triangle, the big blue subtle bubble on top of that) .\r\n\r\nAs usual on my latest pictures, I used this \"natural\" palette that I really like so much.\r\n\r\nThe process was long and hard and the acquisition also due to the weather in my observatory's region.\r\nThis object was never something prioritari on my desk but I am really happy with the results, even with the hard work to process all this data.",
