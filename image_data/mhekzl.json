    "description": "New upload due to database deletionðŸ˜•\r\n\r\nA bit about editing:\r\nThe M27 I had to make 3 different pictures. (Background, shield around core, and core)\r\nThe core is edited as a SHO mix Red = (50% SII and HA) Green = (20% HA and 80% OIII) Blue = 100% OIII. SII I have only used in the core itself to get some more details.\r\nThe background is traditional RGB, but I've used ha as Lum for too take down some noise.\r\nthe shield around the core is edited as HHOO. Lum and R = HA and G and B = OIII.\r\nAll 3 images are then edited separately, so I mix this together using difrent mask.\r\nThe entire edit was done in Pixinsight in its entirety, except for some masks that I had to draw manually.",
