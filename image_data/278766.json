    "description": "I have gathered 2 hours of SII and OIII for each panel to add to my 4 hrs Ha collected a few weeks ago.  This is a popular target I realise but it is the first time I have captured the breadth of this large nebula, especially in all its HST glory.  Processing this evening has given me something to look forward to on my first day back at work - an extra bonus.",
