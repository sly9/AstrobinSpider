    "description": "As usual and since the opportunity presents itself, I oriented the image with the Lunar South Pole to the west.\r\nIn this configuration, the well-known reliefs such as here Clavius and Moretus with its central mountain, are seen from an unusual angle. \r\nIn addition, there is a depth effect up to the lunar limb that gradually plunges into darkness.\r\nIt seems to me that this perspective also gives more \"thickness\" to the image and highlights the curvature of our satellite.",
