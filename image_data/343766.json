    "description": "Quite a unique galaxy that is not imaged very often right next to Messier 95 in the \"other\" Leo group. They may not be as bright or as large as the others  in Leo, but they are still quite nice I think. Especially this one which shows very unique structure as well as what looks like a very small Needle Galaxy right in the upper left of the galaxy.",
