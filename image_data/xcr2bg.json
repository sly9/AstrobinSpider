    "description": "NGC 6334 is a large star-forming region, which covers a sky area visually slightly larger than the full moon. It is one of the most active star producing regions in the Milky Way. Located  about 5,500 light years from Earth it is approximately 50 light years long. The large nebular gas cloud carries the nickname of The Cat Paw Nebula since it looks like a gigantic cat footprint given the three bubbles in the image that resemble the pads of a Cat's paw.\r\nImaged in Narrowband SHO Hubble Palette with RGB stars on our Officina Stellare RiDK 400 remote telescope, El Sauce (Obstech), Chile.\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby \r\nSystem control Voyager by Leonardo Orazi\r\nChile Team: Mike Selby , Stefan Schmidt, Leo Orazi, John Kasianowicz, Scott Johnson, Josh Balsam, Rick Stevenson",
