    "description": "Two separate animations, one started at 8:08 EDT and the 2nd one at 10:43 EDT.  Need to learn that starting really early the suns intensity increases significantly a little later in the morning so I had to deal with the disk brightening (darkening in this case since the image is inverted!) as the animation goes along.  Some nice movement in the associated filament near the AR.",
