    "description": "Since weather does not play around, I grab older datasets and try to improve my processing. Yesterday, I gave my Rho Ophiuchi a new try. My old version was lacking all the magenta and the whole color balance was wrong. While doing the magic, I more and more moved into a starless version of the clouds. \r\nI know that the processing is a little bit over the top, so let's call it an artistic approach. ;)\r\n\r\nIf you want to try the data for yourself, I uploaded the final stack into a public dataset! http://www.astrobin.com/rawdata/publicdatapools/93/",
