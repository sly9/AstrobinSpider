    "description": "One of the most photographed nebulae has to be the Heart Nebula complex.   It's not hard to see why.   The intricate display of intertwined gas clouds never fails to disappoint.   This view is looking deep within the central area.   At this scale, all the dark pillars and globules that obscure the view become as noteworthy as the emission nebula itself.    On the right, the towering bright column surrounded by the star cluster Melotte 15 makes for an imposing point-of-interest.\r\n\r\nThis image took me almost a year to collect, assemble, and \"finish\", though, I promise I didn't work on it the whole time.   In fact it was sitting on the back burner for so long that I think I forgot about it for a while.   This is a two panel mosaic, in a non-standard SHO-based mix.",
