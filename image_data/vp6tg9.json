    "description": "Data captured on the same night as my latest Jupiter image.\r\n\r\nSeeing was generally good, but with moments of sever \"jelly wobble\" as well.\r\n\r\nGood details come through in this data set, not least of which being three potential storms: one towards the bottom edge of the north polar region, one along the north temperate belt (NTeB) and one on the north tropical zone (NTrZ).\r\n\r\nThis image is a de-rotation of 5 individual images, with the top 15% of frames for each 3 minute capture stacked.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
