    "description": "After losing CED 111 behind my observatory roof, I thought I would double down on dark nebula by turning my attention o the Dark Wolf nebula which was just crossing the meridian.  Leaving the telescope to its own devices, I was pleasantly surprised to find 55 300sec sub exposures safely tucked onto the USB in the morning.  \r\n\r\nMy post processing pathway for the Dark Wolf was pretty similar to CED111 molecular cloud,  \r\n\r\nI was actually quite pleased (and surprised) with the way this one turned out.  It has more \"pop\" than I expected.     The scene makes me think off dark spectral wraiths were gathered round a central campfire of the star Psi 2 Lup ,  \r\n\r\nThat's enough poetic interpretation....",
