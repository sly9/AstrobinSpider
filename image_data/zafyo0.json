    "description": "This data set has been a joy to process and Steve and I must have had some very good seeing at the time that we were imaging.  Of course an edge-on galaxy with intricate dust structure just makes you yearn for greater aperture and FL.  Nevertheless, the TEC140/QSI690 has done a fine job of resolving small scale detail as well as pulling the faint tidal tail out the background noise.  We first gathered a handful of luminance subs in March 2019 and then persevered this year and i am so glad we did.  I have also uploaded a crop.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia: \"NGC 3628, also known as the Hamburger Galaxy[3] or Sarah's Galaxy,[4][5][6][7][8] is an unbarred spiral galaxy about 35 million light-years away in the constellation Leo. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. It has an approximately 300,000 light-years long tidal tail. Along with M65 and M66, NGC 3628 forms the Leo Triplet, a small group of galaxies. Its most conspicuous feature is the broad and obscuring band of dust located along the outer edge of its spiral arms, effectively transecting the galaxy to the view from Earth.\"\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne.\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
