    "description": "Browsing through stellarium I came across this unusual ring galaxy. Identified first in 1826 by James Dunlop and then found again a second time in 1836 by John Herschel. I am so glad i put the time in and imaged it. Located in Eridanus 33 million light years away.\r\nI used gain 0 and offset 50 temp -10 with Darks but no other calibration frames.",
