    "description": "This is made up of 24 AVI's of a 1,000 frames each. Each AVI was processed in AutoStakkert2 using 50% of the frames to create 24 individual TIF files. Flat frame also generated from a  50% stack of 1,000 frames and used to calibrate each ﻿AVI stack. Imaging started at 09:56 BST and continued at 4 minute intervals until the 24th run was made at 11:28 BST. ﻿\r\n\r\nCamera Settings; Exposure 10ms; Gain 40\r\n\r\nSoftware - SharpCap for image capture, AutoStakkert2 and Photoshop (Levels adjustment applied then two runs with the Unsharp Mask 1) 300% at 1 pixel then 2) 40% at 5 pixels). The TIF layers were then aligned, cropped and ordered to produce the time-lapse with a 0.08s interval between each frame. ﻿\r\n\r\nThanks for checking in.﻿﻿\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n﻿ John﻿",
