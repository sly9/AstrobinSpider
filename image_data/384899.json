    "description": "First shot at a work-in-process Pacman using the new scope.  I think I may have some slight focuser tilt, as the stars are slightly misshapen, but it's not glaringly obvious, thankfully.  I like how the colors ended up on the processing, and have to give acknowledgement to the work of ArtÅ«ras Medvedevas and Marcel Drechsler as inspiration.",
