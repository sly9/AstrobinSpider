    "description": "It was first thought that Sh2-174 was a planetary nebula associated with the white dwarf GD 561, even though this star was significantly offset from the centre of the nebula.  A later opposing view was that Sh2-174 was a Strömgren Sphere (or zone) - a sphere of ionized hydrogen in the interstellar medium surrounding a young hot star.   It is possible that Sh2-174 represents some sort of combination of planetary nebula and Strömgren sphere [see Ransom et al (2015) Astrophysical Journal 799:198].\r\n\r\nSh2-174 was photographed between 2 and 12 June 2021 from our widefield imaging rig in Spain.  Capture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nCamera: QSI 683\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 19 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 24 x 1200s\r\nRed: 36 x 300s\r\nGreen: 36 x 300s\r\nBlue: 36 x 300s\r\n\r\nA total of 23 hours and 20 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Steve Milne",
