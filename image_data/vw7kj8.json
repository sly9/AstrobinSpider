    "description": "A thousand galaxy in one image.\r\n\r\nI am always fascinated by galaxies and especially galaxy clusters , one of my dream getting into this hobby was to capture galaxies that so far away yet so large in scale that our brain cannot simply to put it's size in to perspective. Abell galaxy objects had my mind captured for a long time, as the first time I saw Hubble's abell 370 I was stunned by the beauty of galaxy clusters and always dreamed one day I can capture something similar.\r\n.\r\nI had pretty much dedicated my entire spring to this object, as it is very well know that Portland Oregon does not produce many clear night in spring, so every clear night I had a chance I pointed my telescope at this target, in total I had gathered around 20 hour worth of lum data and only 1 hour each for RGB channel, as for sure next year I will come back at this target and adding more color data.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nOverall I was very pleased with the result, I think this is one of the deeper image of the coma galaxy cluster out there. I think one of the reason I was able to capture fainter halo with relative short time is that I am bit under-sample, with 9um pixel and focal length at 1000 mm I am doing about 1.8 arcsecond/ pixel, yes It will sacrifice little bit detail but It brought the fainter stuff much quicker.\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC 140 ED\r\n\r\nmount: AP-1100\r\n\r\ncamera: Moravian G4-16000, temp set -30C\r\n\r\nGuider: Asi174mini\r\n\r\nsoftware: Skyx and PHD2\r\n\r\nL: 20 hour bin1 600s sub exposure\r\n\r\nR:1 hour bin2 600s sub exposure\r\n\r\nG:1 hour bin2 600s sub exposure\r\n\r\nB:1 hour bin2 600s sub exposure\r\n\r\nPost processing: PI",
