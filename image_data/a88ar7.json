    "description": "First upload since the new astrobin features.  Nice!  I see Pixinsight being used for image solving and annotation now.\r\n\r\nTop Pick from same data, by Deep Sky West's Lloyd Smith: https://astrob.in/ig35wd/C/.  I have not incorporated earlier data from the same scope and location here, just the latest from Q1 2020.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting target to process. It looks nice in RGB or HOO or HaRGB and combinations thereof.  There is a rich star field, a lot of finely ramified Ha structure and sweeping arcs of both Ha and OO forms in the narrow band data.\r\n\r\nThe best way I have found to combine Ha data and other narrowband with RGB and luminance in Pixinsight is by NRGBCombination and PixelMath.  NRGBCombination is a handy shorthand to do a lot of PixelMath to combine RGB with narrowband data.  I use PixelMath itself for pretty basic combinations and one liners to combine the best results output from the processing workflow into a final result, then final check of color (hue, saturation), noise reduction, sharpness, contrast ... and throw it on astrobin if I want feedback and to share.",
