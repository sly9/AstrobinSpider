    "description": "First attempt of NGC 3576 the Statue of Liberty in Bicolour HOO narrowband from my backyard. I have experience so many problems with the acquisition of the data for this objects, since I have a new camera, and pretty much a new telescope+camera set up, so due to tilt problems, dew problems, cloud problems, among other, all I could use is only 2.25 h of Ha and 1 h of OIII of very poor quality to make the first effort of combination of narrowband channels.\r\n\r\nI know is not perfect, the next year I will re do this object for sure, since I really like it, and now is not  the optimun season to shot at it.\r\n\r\nCheers",
