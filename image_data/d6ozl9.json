    "description": "Somehow it is crazy what we can make visible with our amateur telescopes today. The Tulip Nebula, embedded in the numerous H-Alpha filaments, is often captured in images. \r\n\r\nBut for us (visually right next to it) the Bow Shockwave from Cyg X-1 is also visible. It is the first black hole that could be detected at all. :-)\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:\r\nCygnus X-1 (abbreviated Cyg X-1) is a galactic X-ray source in the constellation Cygnus and was the first such source widely accepted to be a black hole. It was discovered in 1964 during a rocket flight and is one of the strongest X-ray sources seen from Earth. It remains among the most studied astronomical objects in its class. The compact object is now estimated to have a mass about 14.8 times the mass of the Sun and has been shown to be too small to be any known kind of normal star, or other likely object besides a black hole. If so, the radius of its event horizon has 300 km \"as upper bound to the linear dimension of the source region\" of occasional X-ray bursts lasting only for about 1 ms.",
