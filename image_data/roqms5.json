    "description": "In spring 2020, some of the great \"classics\" were on the to-do list. Among them were the two big \"M\" of the Leo triplet. Both galaxies are barred spiral galaxies, with Messier 65 looking rather ordinary. Messier 66 shows strong star formation in its two short spiral arms, and has distinct tidal tails at its northern end. However, these are not likely to be from an encounter with NGC 3628, the third representative of the Leo triplet, nor from one with Messier 65, although all three galaxies are similarly distant and thus form a real group. Messier 66 probably \"swallowed\" at least one larger dwarf galaxy, and we can observe the result of this cosmic meal today.\r\n\r\nL: 39x10 min; RGB 22x10 min each channel; total: 17 h 30 min",
