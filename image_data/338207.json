    "description": "For the amount of acquisition time, I wish it looked a little better, but broadband at f/8 under Bortle 8 skies is pretty difficult. Still, galaxies are my favorite targets even if my own Astrobin wall says otherwise. \r\n\r\nI also messed up and selected the blue filter once instead of the red filter, hence the unevenness in number of RGB subs. This might have been a happy accident though, since I had issues getting a good signal-to-noise ratio in my blue subs.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Anis Abdul and CloudyNights user \"happylimpet\" for helping me figure out how to fix some failed flats and rescue this one. This came close to being 40+ hours of trash. Considering how awful weather was this February and March, that really would have been heart-breaking!",
