    "description": "It is not the first time, that I worked on this target. I was not really satisfied with the result til now. After collimation of the newtonian, I decided to give it a new try in hubble colors. Sometimes you can see while livestacking that this will be a nice one and so here. Please look at full resolution to decide if I found collimation well. I can hardly decide, which of the butterflies two wings I prefer,I like them both and with the full frame of the ASI 6200, I have them both on one pic. I was struggeling to buy it a new camera, because I already had a 1600 but now I am happy I did. Again I aided the O III with some CLS frames, which I find very helpful. Hope you like it too...",
