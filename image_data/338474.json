    "description": "Hi all!\r\nThis image is the composit of two different dataset acquired at several years of distance. I've used, as a base image, the one acquired trough my Takahashi Epsilon 210 at the annual star party of Astrocampania in June 2017. The scale was small and the integration time short but I decided to go since I still have too many images \"waiting\" for more integration and never have time to get it! I've found other integration of the same subject with a better resolution and focal lenght acquired several years ago... I'm not shure but I think I've used the Officina Stellare UCRC 300. I've managed to enlarge the Tak image by 125% and reduced the image at higher resolution to match. Frames where out of alignement so I've had to crop and change the orientation (rotated the finished image) to have a better composition and to have enough RGB to color the entire frame... Anyway this is the image I've got, not the best I've done but still nice I hope.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
