    "description": "This is my first attempt shooting with Narrowband.  To start, I was hoping to get 2 hours in each channel, but my mount failed on meridian flip and I was only able to get about 30 minutes of Oiii.  The Ha pretty much overwhelmed it, but I pushed the data pretty hard to at least hint it was there.  I hope to add another 3.5 hours on Oiii as well as double the Ha and Sii.  ",
