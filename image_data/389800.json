    "description": "Some further old data that I acquired from Spain through a Borg 5\" refractor was of the jellyfish nebula. At the time I could not process it as well as I would have liked and some mosaic issues too, were troublesome. Finally I have processed it. The scope took: Ha 6nm, 40x1200\", OIII 6nm, 48x1200\", and SII 6nm 40x1200\". The total integration time was 42.7 hours.",
