    "description": "December and January skies haven't been great this year â€“ mostly overcast and unsteady.\r\n\r\nFortunately I found a few steady clearings to capture this UFO Galaxy (NGC 2683) which was well-positioned from 9 PM to 5 AM.\r\n\r\nThe small galaxy at the 9 o'clock position is PGC2030408. I believe it's approximately 800 million light years from Earth.\r\n\r\n\"NGC 2683 is a field spiral galaxy discovered by William Herschel on February 5, 1788. It was nicknamed the \"UFO Galaxy\" by the Astronaut Memorial Planetarium and Observatory.\r\n\r\nIt is viewed nearly edge-on from Earth's location in space and is located 20 million light-years away.\r\n\r\nBlended light from a large population of old yellowish stars forms the remarkably bright galactic core. Starlight silhouettes the dust lanes along winding spiral arms, dotted with the telltale blue glow of young star clusters in this galaxy's star forming regions.\r\n\r\nNGC 2683 is rich in globular clusters, hosting about 300 of them, twice the number found in the Milky Way.\"",
