    "description": "I find the anomalous arms or jets in the core of M106 fascinating so I devoted some time to these in both Ha and OIII.  These arms are brightest in the x-ray and radio wavelengths but show up well in NB.  \r\n\r\nFrom an APOD on these:  \"an analysis of the x-ray and radio data suggests that the anamolous arms are composed of material heated by shock waves.  Detected at radio wavelengths, powerful jets originating in the galaxy's core likely drive the shocks into the disk of NGC 4258.\"\r\nhttps://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070411.html\r\n\r\nAnother beautiful view of these in a visible light APOD is here:  https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130206.html\r\n\r\nAnything that happens outside the plane of rotation of the galaxy is interesting to me.  And that these emanate from the black hole at the galaxy core makes them doubly interesting.\r\n\r\nThis is comprised of 19 hours of Ha and 6 hours of OIII at 5 and 3nm respectively.  I was interested to see that the arms did appear in the OIII data as well.  \r\n\r\nThe blend is a bi-color with just a bit of Ha in the green.  The stars are RGB.",
