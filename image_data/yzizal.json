    "description": "HFQ1 is the faintest subject I have photographed so far. Even though it is up in the sky all night and I could capture 8-9 hours data per clear night, it is indeed way too faint.  I kept integrating and adding  subs over 20 days sessions.  When I am done, I can't believe I have reached 80+ hours, Wow! It is easily my most  exposed target. While I was working post processing,  my 7 year-old boy jumped into my room and said,: \"Daddy, that is a stingray with a ball?\" . Hence  here comes the title :-)\r\n    Lesson learned,  photographing a dim subject like this  in white zone is probably not a good idea.   \r\n\r\nNights:\r\n10/15/2020, 10/16/2020, 10/20/2020, 10/21/2020, 10/22/2020, 10/24/2020, 10/29/2020, 10/30/2020, 10/31/2020, 11/1/2020, 11/2/2020, 11/3/2020\r\n\r\nSubs:\r\nha: 80x1800\"\r\no3: 79x1800\"\r\nr/g/b: 30x120\"",
