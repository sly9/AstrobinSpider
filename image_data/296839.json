    "description": "Hubble palette mix of the Eagle Nebula.  I currently have my \"galaxy season\" camera on the scope, meaning small pixel, small field of view.  But with the full moon coming I checked the framing and found SBIG STT 8300 on the Planewave CDK14 worked pretty well for this target.  So this was shot mostly with Full to one quarter moon.  Astrodon 5,3,3 nm filters really get the job done with the moon out!\r\n\r\nI've since decided to leave the camera on a bit longer and get some detailed shots of the southern nebulae.\r\n\r\n21 Ha, 32 SII, and 29 OIII, all 15 minutes.",
