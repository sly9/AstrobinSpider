    "description": "It was discovered by amateur British astronomer John Bevis in 1731.Crab Nebula is famous for its supernova remnants. It is a gas created by a star during the supernova explosion. The supernova, observed by Chinese astronomers on June 4, 1054, is about four times brighter than Venus, or - 6. According to records, it can be seen in the daytime for 23 consecutive days and continuously observed by naked eyes for 653 days in the night sky. The nebula, which is made up of supernova explosions, has spread to a diameter of about 10 light-years and is still expanding outward at super-high speeds of up to 1,800 km/s.",
