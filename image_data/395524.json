    "description": "First image with our new operational set-up(dual with the Altair 130) @-Eye in Spain, the FSQ-106 and Moravian G2-16200, \r\nMessier 78 is a reflection nebula as located in the direction of the Orion constellation. Located about 1,350 light-years from Earth, M78 is the brightest diffuse reflection nebula that belongs to the Orion B molecular cloud complex, a group of nebulae that includes NGC 2064, NGC 2067 and NGC 2071. It is easily found with small telescopes and appears like a bright, hazy patch in the night sky.\r\nM78 is a cloud of interstellar dust. It is illuminated over an expanse of four light years by the by the energy of its embedded, bright blue, early B-type stars which emit a continuous spectrum. In the area are 45 low mass stars with hydrogen emission lines – irregular variable stars similar to the star T Tauri – which may very well be at the beginning stages of their stellar life.\r\nOne thing is certain – Messier 78 is a pretty incredible star forming region\r\nA significant number of dramatic outflow sources are found in the region of M78. Called Herbig-Haro objects, astronomers believe these are jets of matter ejected from neophyte newly formed inside M78\r\nL : 65x600sec\r\nR : 50x300sec en binx2\r\nG : 46x300 sec en binx2\r\nB : 32x300sec en binx2\r\nSoit 21h30minutes d’exposition",
