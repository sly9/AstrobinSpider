    "description": "This was one of my 2016 fall project that never got completed due to bad weather.  I started with a 6 panel mosaic with the QSI690 and then switched camera to ASI1600 and restarted it with a 4 panel mosaic. But I couldnt get enough nights on it to collect data needed to complete it.\r\nI was going for either HaRGB or HaOIII. But now I have just Ha (Some panels have less data than another).\r\n\r\nThis is a 4 panel mosaic. Two panels have about 50x5 minutes and other 2 panels have 30x5 minutes. \r\n\r\nHoping to collect data later this year.",
