    "description": "With the dust coming down many details start to get noticeable!\r\nVallis Marineris very visible near 8 am, Chryse, Acidalia and Argyre Planitia stand out easily as well as Margaritifer and Meridiani Planum, but what I liked was to be able to capture with good resolution the various dark craters like Trouvelot, Rutherford, Becquerel and Radau perfectly recognizable to the left side of Arabia Land almost a little above the center of the photo.\r\nCertainly one of my best Mars photos this year!",
