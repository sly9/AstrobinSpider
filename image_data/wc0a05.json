    "description": "NGC1333 nebula, shot in cooperation with @astrophoto_ygk. We split our tasks, I focused onto L channel and Tudor did the RGB. I really love this aspect of the hobby - it can unite us despite the distance and pandemic. \r\n\r\nThe technical aspect: TS 10” f/4.5 ONTC, ASI1600, UV/IR cut, Deep Sky Dad AF3, Deep Sky Dad prototype rotator, Deep Sky Dad prototype mirror heaters to prevent dewing. Over 25h of total exposure.\r\n\r\nWiki: This nebula is in the western part[4] of the Perseus molecular cloud and is a young region of very active star formation, being one of the best-studied objects of its type. It contains a fairly typical hierarchy of star clusters that are still embedded in the molecular cloud in which they formed, which are split into two main sub-groups to the north and south. Most of the infrared emission is happening in the southern part of the nebula. A significant portion of the stars seen in the infrared are in the pre-main sequence stage of their evolution. Estimates of the distance to this nebula range from 980–1,140 ly.",
