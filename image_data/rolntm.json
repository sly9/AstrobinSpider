    "description": "Here is a view of an emission nebula in the constellation Centaurus known as the Running Chicken Nebula. The bright glowing red is hydrogen gas that is emitting red wavelengths of light after absorbing energy from nearby starlight. I used a PlaneWave CDK24 telescope and L-600 mount to capture 8 hours of images through LRGB filters from ObsTech in Chile. I processed the images with PixInsight and Photoshop. Happy to answer any questions about imaging from the dark skies at ObsTech in Chile.",
