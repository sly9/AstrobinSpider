    "description": "Having seen this beautiful structured galaxy the first time while live stacking with sharpcap, I was astonished a little bit. I expected it larger and brighter. For the subs of this image, I had to hopp through the cloud gaps over five nights using the quite well working cloudradar in internet and as with time more and more structure appeared and I was happy with that beauty. While processing I had to decide about the color. Watching several good pics and the hubble view I was a little confused about the color variations between more bluish and more brown tone versions I could find. Finally I decided for the color setting you can see here, from witch I hope, you also like it.\r\n\r\nRework: adding 50 x 150 sec luminence data and rework color settings",
