    "description": "Sharpless 2-132 is a bright nebula appearing constallation Cepheus. It is 1794 light years from our solar system. From the appropriate place, Sh2-132 is an effortlessly photographable object in summer time, especially from July. However, a relatively clear weather has welcomed in Summer, the Carpatian Basin being smothered in dust made the amateur astronomersâ€™ job difficult. Except for the full moon cycles, the fog following sunsets, hardly providing opportunity for  observation. So I started exposing this photo a little bit late at the end of September 2016 when the weather was good. But being extremely faint, it is hardly ever photographed in Ha, OIII and SII with real RGB colors. Due to this, I had to take countless expos, which took more than 40 hours altogether.\r\n\r\n58 x 360 Ha (RASA)\r\n36 x 1200 OIII (Esprit)\r\n26 x 1200 SII (Esprit)\r\n07 x 300 R (Esprit)\r\n07 x 300 G (Esprit)\r\n07 x 300 B (Esprit)",
