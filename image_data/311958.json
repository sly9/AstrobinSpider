    "description": "This is a combination of SII, Ha, and OII data (SHO). I used RGB data to improve the star color.\r\nHope you enjoy it !\r\n\r\nObject description (wikipedia.org) :\r\n\r\nWesterhout 5 (Sharpless 2-199, LBN 667, Soul Nebula) is an emission nebula located in Cassiopeia. Several small open clusters are embedded in the nebula: CR 34, 632, and 634 (in the head) and IC 1848 (in the body). The object is more commonly called by the cluster designation IC 1848.\r\nSmall emission nebula IC 1871 is present just left of the top of the head, and small emission nebulae 670 and 669 are just below the lower back area.\r\nThe galaxies Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 are both nearby the nebula, although light extinction from the Milky Way makes them very hard to see. Once thought to be part of our local group, they are now known to belong to their own group- the IC 342/Maffei Group.\r\nThis complex is the eastern neighbor of IC1805 (Heart Nebula) and the two are often mentioned together as the \"Heart and Soul\".",
