    "description": "Hi! Happy and Safe New Year for everyone...! Take Care dear friends...!\r\n\r\nThis is just a simple processing attempt of IC 5201 galaxy...and at revision B, \"The 2020 Great Conjunction\"...just a simple image to record this rare occasion, made by Insight Observatory also...! :-)\r\n\r\n(Wikipedia) IC 5201 is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Grus. It is located at a distance of circa 35 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that IC 5201 is about 90,000 light years across. It was discovered by Joseph Lunt in 1900.\r\n\r\nIC 5201 is characterised by its bright bar, that measures 0.6 × 0.16 arcminutes. The galaxy has multiple thin arms which contain a large number of HII regions, where new stars are born. The largest of these regions have diameter about 5 arcseconds.[6] The galaxy has been found to have HII region activity in its nucleus. The total star formation rate of the galaxy is estimated to be 1.7 M☉ per year. The galaxy is close enough so as its stars can be resolved. The brightest of them have apparent magnitude about 21.5. One ultra-luminous X-ray source has been detected in the galaxy. \r\n\r\nOne supernova has been observed in IC 5201, SN 1978G. It was first reported by J. C. Blades, of the Anglo-Australian Observatory, and R. E. Griffiths, of Center for Astrophysics, on November 24.5 UTC, with apparent magnitude at discovery 13.5. The supernova was detected in its early stages. Spectroscopic observations revealed it was a type II supernova. It was located 1'.6 west and 0'.7 north of the nucleus.\r\n\r\nIC 5201 is characterised as an isolated galaxy. Despite the fact IC 5201 does not belong to a galaxy group, it is the largest galaxy in an area of the universe where lie other galaxies too, like NGC 7462.\r\n\r\n\"Image of the \"Great Conjunction of 2020\" - Jupiter and Saturn imaged on 12/21/2020 using Insight Observatory's affiliate 5\" Williams Optics APO refractor (ATEO-2A) remote telescope at f/14 with a 2x Barlow hosted at SkyPi Remote Observatory in New Mexico. The event was only 12 - 14 degrees above the horizon when imaged by John Evelan and the seeing was a bit challenging. \"",
