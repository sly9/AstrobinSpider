    "description": "Pelican Nebula in SHO palette. Continue learning PixInsight and experimenting with different processing techniques. I like the current result, but I'm sure more experienced astrophotographers can see mistakes and processing issues :) I would appreciate feedback and suggestions!\r\nMy Optolong OIII filter causing halos around bright stars, so I tried different things to remove them, and I think I was able to reduce them significantly, but still, it causing a bluish tint around a star, but without a distinctive border, it looks better.\r\nMy set of Astrodon NB filters should arrive soon. Hopefully, this will improve my images.",
