    "description": "NGC 7822 is a star-forming region around 3,000 light years away in the constellation of Cepheus.  The region includes the emission nebula  Sharpless 2-171, with its star-forming pillars, and the open cluster Berkeley 59, which consists of stars that are just a few million years old.   \r\n\r\nI imaged this relatively recently using my remote Tak 106 set up <a href=\"https://astrob.in/4adx56/0/\">NGC 7822 in Cepheus</a>.  This is from my Esprit 120 at a slightly higher resolution (1.3\" pp vs 2.1\" pp).\r\n\r\nNGC 7822 was photographed between 21 September and 1 December 2019 from my home observatory in the UK. \r\n\r\nTelescope: Skywatcher Esprit 120\r\nCamera: Moravian G2-8300\r\nFilters: Chroma 3nm \r\nMount: Mesu 200\r\n\r\nSII: 24 x 1200s\r\nHa: 24 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 24 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 24 hours exposure.",
