    "description": "VdB 152 is a blue reflection nebula that glows atop of a dark Bok globule, Barnard 175. This complex, also called Wolf’s Cave, spans about 7 light-years and is located about 1,400 light years-away from Earth in the northern constellation of Cepheus.\r\n\r\nDescribed as a “dusty curtain” or “ghostly apparition”, vdB 152 is very faint. Near the edge of a large molecular cloud, interstellar dust in the region blocks most of the starlight behind it or scatter light from the embedded bright star giving parts of the nebula a characteristic blue color. Ultraviolet light from the star is also thought to cause a dim reddish luminescence in the nebular dust.\r\n\r\nThough stars do form in molecular clouds, this star seems to have only accidentally wandered into the area, as its measured velocity through space is very different from the cloud’s velocity.\r\n\r\nEmbedded in the top right side of the nebula is a jet emitted from a newly forming star. The thin, red filaments of a huge supernova remnant, SNR 110.3+11.3, in the upper-right corner of the image, appear to be approaching vdB 152. (Source: Anne's Astronomy News)\r\n\r\nBack to the more serious rig (the MSR?). I have captured this data around the last new moon, while spending a long weekend in a Bortle 4 zone with few fellow astrophotographers. Ha data was actually captured from my balcony in the city.",
