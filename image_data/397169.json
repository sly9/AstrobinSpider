    "description": "Images from the following two scopes (piggybacked) contributed to this image:\r\nAG12+ASI1600MM at .70 asec/pix\r\nTV127is+ASI183MM at .75 asec/pix. \r\nThey were all registered to the best Ha image taken on the AG12.\r\nUsing L (synthetic from RGB) from the TV NP127is refractor effectively eliminates the spikes from the AG12.\r\n\r\nThe reflection nebula NGC 1977 is popularly known as the Running Man Nebula.  It is part of Sh2-279, an HII region and bright nebulae that includes a reflection nebula located in the constellation Orion. It is the northernmost part of the asterism known as Orion's Sword, lying 0.6Â° north of the Orion Nebula. \r\n\r\nThis whole region in Orion's Sword was also later catalogued as Orion 1c. In 1966, van den Bergh distinguished the weak clustering of reflection nebulae that includes Sh2-279 as Ori R2. Every reflection nebula appearing within the Sharpless catalogue were first identified on blue plates of the Palomar Sky Survey, and then double checked against the red plates to eliminate possible plate faults. Van den Berg found that there was a strong concentration of new T Tauri stars around the Orion Nebula, tapering off into a tail approaching Sh2-279.\r\n\r\nThe Running Man Nebula is a popular target for amateur astrophotographers, as it lies close to the Orion Nebula and has many nearby guide stars. The outline of the running man shows up primarily in photographs; it is difficult to perceive visually through telescopes, though the reflection nebula itself is visible in small to medium apertures in dark skies.\r\n(Wikipedia)",
