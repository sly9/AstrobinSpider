    "description": "A beautiful transit!\r\nAnother good image of the king of the planets with plenty of visible details. GRS stands out showing some peculiarities and a beautiful anti-cyclonic system of pink colored near the south pole.\r\nBut what most caught my attention in this image was the fact of having captured details in Ganymede. I was surprised because there was no separate capture or processing to highlight this moon and yet the Osiris region is easily highlighted in my image. Galilean moons are usually processed separately to highlight details and then glued back into place, which was not done in this case.",
