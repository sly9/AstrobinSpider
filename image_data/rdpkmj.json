    "description": "This small (1.7 arc minutes), dim galaxy is an elusive target. I believe this is the is the first time it has been imaged and published by an amateur.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with its bizarre morphology, UGCA 106 is a fascinating object. As stated in the  Catalog of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and Associations, by Halton Arp and Barry Madore, “the outstanding problem in dwarf galaxies seems to be to explain why the grand spiral design becomes more and more disorganized and irregular as the dwarfs become lower in surface brightness, lower in luminosity, and presumably lower in mass.”\r\n\r\nUGCA 106 is included in the Catalog as a peculiar galaxy, meeting the requirements of Category 20.\r\n\r\nTech Notes for ASA 500/3.6:\r\nASA Newtonian, 500 mm aperture, 1900mm focal length, F3.6\r\nFLI Proline 16803, 9 mm pixel, 4096 X 4096\r\nASA DDM85 equatorial mount\r\nProcessing with PixInsight, StarTools, and Affinity Photo",
