    "description": "It will certainly be my best Jupiter of the 2018 season because as the planet has passed opposition times I can hardly get anything better.\r\nMany details are visible but what is most noticeable is the Oval BA at 4am.\r\nThe black and white photos is a simple grayscale filter and not a picture on the IR as I often post.\r\nI want to thank tellescopio.com.br who kindly donated the camera that made it possible to get this image!",
