In reality the galaxy that appears to be the monster's next meal, PGC 21338, lies roughly 75,000 times farther from Earth than CG4. The galaxy witnessing the carnage from above is NGC 2427.\r\n\r\nFor more on CG4 and other cometary globules: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1503/\r\n\r\nI shot this using an Astro Physics RH305 that I rent from master astrophotographer Martin Pugh at his remote telescope hosting observatory in Australia.
