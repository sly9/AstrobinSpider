    "description": "Dual imaging setup: HyperStar C9.25\" f/2.2 and Atik 490 mono with OIII filter for luminance, and Esprit 100 f/4.3 with ASI294 for color data, mounted side-by-side on a CGX mount.  Taken from my backyard north of Tucson, aimed low back over the city.  SQM was 19.6 toward the object.  I was surprised how well this came out, though it could use more than 5 hours of exposure time.",
