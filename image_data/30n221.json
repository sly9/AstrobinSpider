    "description": "I wasn't satisfied with my previous image of this object...the inner star clusters were not well defined and I wasn't satisfied with the colors and just the general processing.  So I did a complete reprocess and then cropped it by about 35% to just show the main nebula and some of the other interesting nebula's and star clusters.  This time, I didn't do any NR or star reduction.  It's 40+ hours  total integration time with exposures varying from 120s to 1800s, HSOLRGB.   I don't know if you might think it looks any better but I do....you be the judge!!\r\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\r\nTom",
