    "description": "I gave INDI/Kstars/Ekos a first shot last night and this is one of the data sets that I captured.\r\n\r\nOverall it was a good experience - the drivers seemed very stable and I had no problem with crashes or hangs.\r\n\r\nThe main issue I had was with the plethora of settings spread over many screens, some settings that didn't seem to persist between sessions, and I could not get it to use plate solving (which worked) to do a precise slew to my custom location.\r\n\r\nSo the Soap Bubble Nebula got cut in half (bottom left) - but it was the first night I can't complain too much.",
