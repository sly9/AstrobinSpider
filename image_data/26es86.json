    "description": "My second complete image in the books!  Sh2-171 known also as the Pillars of Cepheus is an emission nebula in the constellation Cepheus. It is part of the surrounding bigger structure NGC 7822 which is not in this field of view. This image is presented in the hubble pallet also known as SHO which stands for Sulfur-Hydrogen-Oxygen. I am really happy with the results of this image. Hope you all enjoy and thanks for any constructive comments.\r\n \r\nEquipment:\r\nTelescope - Sky-watcher Esprit 120\r\nImaging Camera- ZWO ASI 1600mm Pro Cool\r\nMount - Sky-watcher EQ6-R Pro\r\n \r\nSoftware:\r\nSequence Generator Pro\r\nPixensight\r\nLightroom\r\nPhotoshop\r\n \r\nLights:\r\nSII-50x600sec\r\nHA- 50x600sec\r\nOiii-50x600sec\r\nRed-20x90sec\r\nGreen-20x90sec\r\nBlue-20x90sec\r\n30 Darks\r\n100 Bias\r\nTotal integration 26.5 Hours",
