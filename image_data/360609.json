    "description": "I imaged this with both my refactor for wide field and my SCT for the core.  I was hoping to get more detail and resolution for the core with the SCT.  It is a combination of both image scales as well as a combination of RGB stars and HOO and SHO blended color pallet.\r\n\r\nNGC 7635 - The Bubble Nebula - Emission Nebula\r\nNGC 7635 also known as the Bubble Nebula is a HII region emission nebula located in northwestern Cassiopeia close to the border with Cepheus. It appears round in shape due to expanding gas from the stellar wind of a massive hot central star (mag. +8.7). The nebula is located in a giant molecular cloud that glows due to excitation from the star. It was discovered by William Herschel on November 3, 1787.",
