    "description": "(Late to the bandwagon, I know) \r\n\r\nEarlier I threw together some photos I got of the eclipse from Weiser, ID (totality 2m 6s) and thought I'd post here. Have yet to process 'em into something cool!\r\n\r\nThese were taken using a T6s with BYEOS through a Vixen 70mm F/8 apo refractor. As part of my science fair project last year, I had made two image capture plans on BYEOS (for partial phases and totality) to take the different exposures I wanted so I could leave the computer running and enjoy the eclipse.",
