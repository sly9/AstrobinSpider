    "description": "With thunderstorms imminent and a long stretch of clouds on the horizon, I didn't have time to capture OIII the way I wanted.  So, I took the quick route and settled for bin 2x2 in one short evening.  Fortunately, the finished image doesn't seem to have suffered too much.  Thanks for looking!\r\n\r\n\"NGC 281 is an H II region in the constellation of Cassiopeia and part of the Perseus Spiral Arm. It includes the open cluster IC 1590, the multiple star HD 5005, and several Bok globules. Colloquially, NGC 281 is also known as the Pacman Nebula for its resemblance to the video game character.\" [Source: Wikipedia]\r\n\r\nNGC 281 lies 9,500 light years distant and has a diameter of 97 light years.",
