    "description": "The luminance data was collected from my Celestron 8SE with a Starizona SCT Corrector II. Which does a much better job than my old Meade focal reducer.  The stars are much better shaped, not perfect but far less coma out at the edges than the Meade reducer.  The luminance data was the result of stacking 700, 20-second unguided images.  As I couldn't achieve a good guide star with my current ZWO OAG &  QHY5L-II-M.  I plan to get the Celestron OAG as it has a much bigger prism and also update my guide camera to an ASI174 Mini which has a much bigger sensor  :-) Hopefully this will make finding guide stars a lot easier. \r\n\r\nThe RGB data is first light with an ASI183MM-C. So far I am enjoying this camera with my WO GT102 as I am able to gain a little better resolution when skies permit.  Looking forward to capturing some luminance data and narrow band with the ASI183 soon.\r\n\r\nOverall this image is the result of ironing out new equipment issues and such. I ended up having to crop the luminance data as M63 was off centered. Oppps! Hopefully the next target I image things will go much smoother. At least that's the plan! Lol!",
