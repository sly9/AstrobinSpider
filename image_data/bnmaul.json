    "description": "These two sets of interacting galaxies are listed in Halton Arp’s Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 296 and Arp 299.\r\n\r\nArp 299 is the larger set at the center of the image and consists of NGC 3690 and IC 694. There are numerous peer-reviewed publications on Arp 299 that discuss regions of powerful starburst activity, as well as eight supernovae detected during 1990 – 2010. An article published in August 2018 reports a possible tidal disruption event (TDE) “produced when a star is ripped apart by the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH)” \r\n<a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6401/482.full\" target= _new>https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6401/482.full </a> \r\nArp 299 is approximately 130 million light-years away.\r\n\r\nArp 296 is at the right of center in the image and consists of a quite distinct barred face-on spiral galaxy (PGC 35345) and a less distinct galaxy (PGC 2580146) exhibiting filamentary structure on either side. Arp 296 is much further away than Arp 299 at an approximate distance of 800 million light-years.\r\n\r\nI found very few on-line images of this field. The most prominent are a broadband image of Arp 299 from the Hubble telescope as well as hybrid images combining Hubble data with x-ray data from NuSTAR and Chandra. I have found no images that show the broad tail stretching from Arp 299 to the blue star at lower right in my image. The Hubble-based images and others published in professional literature tend to be tightly centered on Arp 299 and do not show the wider field. There are many other galaxies visible within this field.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the image!",
