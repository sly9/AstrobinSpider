    "description": "Imaged on nights of 2/6/2021, 2/7/2021, 2/26/2021, 2/27/2021\r\n\r\nAbell 31 (PK219.1+31.2) is a frequently imaged planetary nebula in Cancer.  Abell31 is one of the largest PNs in the sky, measuring 16.2 arc minutes and has a magnitude listed at 12. It shows some on the RGB image. Even though the magnitude is listed as 12, both the Ha and Oiii are exceptionally weak, but since the Oiii is stronger in the central region where they overlap, both show well in this enhanced image.  Ha forms a large ring around a central Oiii region in this image, but the Ha is just as strong in the central area as it is in the outer regions. The apparent tiny blue progenitor star is centered on the central Oiii area, but the Ha extends a large bulge to the bottom right in this image.  A rather unusual appearance.\r\n\r\nMy Abell Collection is here:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\nCurrently 60+, and soon to be complete.\r\n\r\nWikipedia:\r\nAbell 31 is an ancient planetary nebula in the constellation of Cancer. It is estimated to be about 2,000 light years away. Although it is one of the largest planetary nebulae in the sky, it is not very bright.",
