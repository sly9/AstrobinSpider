    "description": "Messier 82\r\nMessier 82 also refereed to as the cigar galaxy has been recently perturbed by an interaction with M 81 the result is a period of explosive star formation and what appears to be some disrupted structure in the dust lanes, tendrils of material extending away from the nucleus suggest a colossal explosion, studies have reviled the filaments to be expanding outward at 600 miles per second. The filaments give this galaxy a very unique and distinctive appearance, the tidal influence from M 81 has also deformed M82, a process that started 100 million years ago. This interaction has lead to star formation 10x that of a regular galaxy.",
