    "description": "This is a mixed bag of subs that was started in September 2020!  I was hoping for more of everything - subs and final image quality!  I expected to bring out the fainter dust a lot easier but had to curb my expectations quite quickly.\r\n\r\nI'm ready to park this version as I was getting frustrated swapping kit to get ready to grab another hour or so and even then the weather wasn't great.  \r\n\r\n5 hours was captured in September 2020 and another 3-4 in January 2021.  I wasted a night in November when I eyeballed the position angle after putting the camera back on (even though the RedCat has the dial AND voyager tells me the PA!) and got it wrong enough to make the evening's subs a write off - the final image would have been cropped much closer if I'd kept them in due to the incorrect angle.\r\n\r\nCaptured with Voyager, stacked and calibrated in APP then processed in PixInsight.\r\n\r\nThere's always scope for more data next year!",
