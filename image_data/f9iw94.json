    "description": "This is going to be my last image for a while. In addition to not being able to do astrophotography due to work obligations, I also broke a push screw on my Ritchey-Chretien and can't get it out, so that scope is out of commission for the foreseeable future (there's literally no way to collimate it). I got a Moonlite for my Newt, but I have no idea when I'll be able to attach it, so unless I just want to put up with the focuser tilt that's been annoying me for ages, that scope is also out of commission until I can find the time to drill. I still haven't got replacement parts for my AZ-EQ5 and I have issues balancing smaller scopes on the EQ6-R, so the Sharpstar and ES80 are out of commission as well. I miss this hobby like crazy.",
