    "description": "M109 (NGC 3992) is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 80 Mly away in Ursa Major.  M109 is located southeast of the star Phecda (Î³ UMa).  It is by far the most distant object in the Messier Catalog.\r\n\r\nIn March 1956, supernova 1956A was observed in M109.  SN 1956A was a type Ia supernova in the southeast part of the galaxy, as marked in the annotated revision, glowing at magnitude 12.8 to 12.3 at its maximum.  SN 1956A has been the only supernova observed in M109 since its discovery.\r\n\r\nM109 has three known satellite galaxies (UGC 6923, UGC 6940, and UGC 6969).  Only UGC 6923 and 6940 are within the FOV of my image.\r\n\r\nHere is the legend for the annotated objects:\r\n\r\n&emsp;* - Star\r\n&emsp;G - Galaxy    \r\n&emsp;ClG - Cluster of Galaxies\r\n&emsp;GiC - Galaxy in Cluster of Galaxies    \r\n&emsp;BiC - Brightest galaxy in a Cluster (BCG)    \r\n&emsp;GiG - Galaxy in Group of Galaxies    \r\n&emsp;GiP - Galaxy in Pair of Galaxies\r\n&emsp;QSO - Quasar\r\n&emsp;SN* - SuperNova\r\n&emsp;Rad - Radio-source\r\n&emsp;LM* - Low-mass star (M<1solMass)\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy!",
