    "description": "Imaged already last September, it took me a few tries and quite a while until I was able to complete the processing. I had completely different end result in my mind when I started, but somehow it ended up like this and I do like the end result a lot. The nebula is in SHO palette, stars are from RGB exposures.\r\n\r\nI think there are actually two lions in the nebula, one big and one small. Can you find both?",
