    "description": "There are many widefield images of the emission nebula IC 410.  So, here's a close up of the nebula, the tadpoles and the young star cluster at its center, NGC 1893, responsible for energizing nebula and sculpting the Tadpoles.  Composed of denser cooler gas and dust, the tadpoles are about 10 light years in length and likely sites of ongoing star formation.  IC 410 is about 10,000 light years from Earth and located in the constellation Auriga.  \r\n\r\nTaken over multiple nights:  Jan 7, 9 and 11-13, 2020.",
