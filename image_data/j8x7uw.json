    "description": "The Veil Nebula captured recently using the new QHY600 60 Megapixel Full Frame Monochrome CMOS camera mounted on the Takahashi 130 FSQ that we have the honor of testing for QHYCCD.  \r\n\r\nIn this Hubble Palette version (SHO) the H-Alpha is mapped to green, SII is mapped to red and OIII is mapped to the blue channel. while the colors in this image are not the true colors, the narrowband filters used in the making of this Hubble Palette image reveal much more of the hidden gasses not visible in a broadband image, covering an area over 3 x 2 degrees of sky of are the Eastern Veil Nebula NGC6992 to the Western Veil Nebula NGC6960 (Witch’s Broom) far right with “Pickering’s Triangle” in between at the top of the image as well as “The Funnel” just below and the many knot’s and strands visible here and within this beautiful Supernova remnant.   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis new setup is available immediately for people wanting to subscribe to Grand Mesa Observatory's system 1.   \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCaptured over 5 nights in July and August for a total acquisition time of 8.8 hours. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTechnical Details \r\n\r\nCaptured and processed by: Terry Hancock \r\n\r\nLocation: GrandMesaObservatory.com Purdy Mesa, Colorado  \r\n\r\nDates of Capture July 30, August 6th, 8th, 11th and 13th 2020  \r\n\r\nHA 210 min 21 x 600 sec  \r\n\r\nOIII 140 min 14 x 600  sec \r\n\r\nSII 180 min 18 x 600 sec  \r\n\r\nNarrowband Filters by Optolong \r\n\r\nCamera: QHY600 Monochrome CMOS Photographic version \r\n\r\nCamera Details and Specs https://www.qhyccd.com/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=94&id=55&cut=1 \r\n\r\nGain 60, Offset 76 in Read Mode Photographic 16 bit \r\n\r\nCalibrated with dark, Bias and Flat Frames \r\n\r\nOptics: Walter Holloway's Takahashi FSQ 130 APO Refractor @ F5 \r\n\r\nImage Scale: 1.19 arcsec/pix \r\n\r\nField of View: 3d 7' 41.0\" x 2d 3' 5.3 (127.3 x 190.1 arcmin) \r\n\r\nEQ Mount: Paramount ME  \r\n\r\nImage Acquisition software Maxim DL6 Pre Processing in Pixinsight Post Processed in Photoshop CC",
