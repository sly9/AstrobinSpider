    "description": "Captured on September 27th at Grand Mesa Observatory using QHYCCDâ€™s latest offering the QHY410C Back Illuminated Full Frame one shot color CMOS camera that we have the honor of testing. \r\nThis is work in progress as the conditions on the night of capture were quite poor with smoke from California wild fires that have plagued us for the past 3 months.\r\nA stream of red emission dominates this close up shot of part of Barnards Loop otherwise known as Sh2-276 , a large emission Nebula and part of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. The image also nicely captures areas of dark nebulosity LDN 1622 which lies at a distance of 500 light years as well as the blue reflection nebula of M78 located some 1,600 light years away, M78 hosts 17 Herbig-Haro objects (patches of nebulosity created by young stars whose jets collide with nearby dust and gas).\r\n\r\nThis new setup is available immediately for people wanting to subscribe to Grand Mesa Observatory's system 4a\r\n\r\nTechnical Info: \r\nTotal Integration time 1.83 hours  \r\nLocation: GrandMesaObservatory.com Purdy Mesa, Colorado\r\nDate of capture: September 27th 2020\r\nColor RGGB 110 min, 55 x 120 sec \r\nCamera: QHY410C Back Illuminated Full Frame Color CMOS\r\nGain 0, Offset 76\r\nRead Mode: High Gain Mode\r\nCalibrated with Dark, Bias and Flat Frames\r\nOptics: Takahashi E-180 Astrograph\r\nImage Acquisition software Maxim DL6\r\nPre Processed in Pixinsight\r\nPost Processed in Photoshop",
