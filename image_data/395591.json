    "description": "The last month has been a rainy snowy mess with little opportunity to collect any new data. So I thought it would be interesting to process some data from the Hubble Space Telescope archive.\r\n\r\nThis image takes the 658 nm data from the MAST Portal and uses it as a luminosity layer over a color tone map of two of my images of Eta Carina (The Hubble Palette and the HRGB images). Zoom in on the image. There are tons of detail. BTW, it was really fun trying to register my Eta Carina images with the MAST image. This all had to be done manually.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested these data sets can be found at the following URL (https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html). I searched \"Carina Nebula\" and selected the HLSP mission and the Filter F658N. These data sets are all available to the public.\r\n\r\nThese are very large files and can tax your computer mightily. The posted image is just a fraction of the downloaded FOV.",
