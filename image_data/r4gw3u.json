    "description": "I was not sure what I could expect from imaging this object from France. Horizon clouds often disturbed the imaging session and two trees just gave me a small time window for my work on this target. Very interesting how this planetary looks in O III. I aimed to give this\"eye of good\" a natural looking pic, because  I  don't want to have any trouble with him, when he doesn't like my version of his eye later on. So I tried not to overdo with processing, even I could have pushed the fainter parts a little more. I am not able to reach that\" holy eye\" from my backyard and for this it was a clear  object on my wishlist for my France holiday. Hope you like it.",
