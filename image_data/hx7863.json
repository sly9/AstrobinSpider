    "description": "For M101, I decided to image without the reducer. At f8 it would be slow but 1600mm FL had its own adventages. I always hated m101, I don't know the reason I just did. But after this image, i gotta admit, its not as bad I thought. Btw its the first light for my 5DM3. Totally love it.",
