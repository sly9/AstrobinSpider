    "description": "This is first light with my Skywatcher Quattro and I'm glad I saved this target for it! With a lot of high cloud on this night, the data is far from perfect but I'll take anything at the moment with the eternal cloud cover we have here in Wellington.⁣\r\n⁣\r\nThis is NGC 6726-27 - a giant molecular cloud complex and one of the closest star forming regions in the Milky Way. Young blue stars light up the center creating a beautiful scene as their light reflects off the abundance of swirling dust in this area. Add in a globular cluster and we're done here. ⁣\r\n⁣\r\nHope you enjoy this one!⁣",
