    "description": "Thanks to my friend Maximo Suarez, I had the chance to use his Newton 16\" telescope for this session. I am very happy with the results and this might be my best image so far. Many terrain features recognizable around the area of Valles Marineris and  Xanthe Terra, polar cap is prominent and some clouds appear at the northern pole.",
