    "description": "A few days ago, this sunspot rounded the corner and showed itâ€™s face.   During a solar minimum it can be quite rare to find a nice active area on the sun.  So, this is a welcome sight.   It is sending out weak category B-class flares, but \"weak\" is all relative when you are talking about this much energy.\r\n\r\nThis image is a close-up from a 8-APR-2019, using a specialized hydrogen emission line filter.  The atmosphere played nice and held still for a while allowing a nice detailed capture.  The Earth is shown as a scale reference in the bottom right of the image.",
