    "description": "Barnard 150 is an elongated dark nebula, approximately 1° in length,  in the constellation of Cepheus.  It is sometimes referred to as the Seahorse Nebula, for obvious reasons.  According to the APOD team, '...the dusty, obscuring clouds are part of a Milky Way molecular cloud some 1,200 light-years distant'.\r\n\r\nEdward Emerson Barnard (1857 - 1923) was an American astronomer born in Tennessee who became Professor of Astronomy at the University of Chicago.  He published his first catalogue of dark nebulae - 'On the dark markings of the sky with a catalogue of 182 such objects' - in The Astrophysical Journal; January, 1919.  By 1927, Barnard’s catalogue listed 369 dark objects.\r\n\r\nThis was imaged between 12 September and 3 October 2018 from two remote imaging rigs in Spain that are owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me.  \r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescopes: Takahashi FSQ 106 x2\r\nCamera: QSI 683 WSG x2\r\nFilters: Astrodon & Astronomik LRGB\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS & 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nLum: 61 x 600s\r\nRed: 24 x 600s\r\nGreen: 24 x 600s\r\nBlue: 24 x 600s\r\n\r\nA total of 22 hours and 10 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData Capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne\r\n\r\nUPDATE 8 October 2018: Sigga very kindly sent me a link to some information about EE Barnard and his later (indeed, posthumous) two-volume \"An Atlas of Selected Regions of the Milky Way\" (1927).
