    "description": "After already imaging the Rosette Nebula last year, I have always been wanting to do a better version of it.\r\n\r\nThe data was gathered in quite clear, moon-free nights and the result was visible in the integrated files. I was keen on keeping the details while processing this image, as I do not get those nights very often where I am at.\r\n\r\nLike always, I was struggling with the right level of saturation and keeping some opacity to the nebula. I hope I managed to settle for the right levels.",
