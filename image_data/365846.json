    "description": "This image focuses on the area surrounding the Tarantula Nebula and associated star cluster (NGC2070) within the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).  Indeed, there are many objects within the field of view that have their own NGC designations.  The Tarantula Nebula is extremely luminous and would have cast shadows on Earth if it were as close as the Orion Nebula. \r\n\r\nThe image was processed in PixInsight using the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) palette (Red = OIII, Green = Ha, Blue = SII). The final image was re-sampled by 120% for aesthetic reasons.",
