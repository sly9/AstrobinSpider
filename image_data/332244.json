    "description": "My southern sky is obstructed by trees (bummer) and the Rosette just barely appears above the treetops for about an hour and a half in winter.  It took two seasons to acquire the data for this and unfortunately last seasons Ha data was at a different image scale as I didn't yet have my FR installed.  I had some major challenges in getting the channels to align and scale properly and fought elongated stars and misaligned colors due to some spacing issues before the FR was put on.  I'm glad that I finally was able to put this image together - it's such a stunning target with rich and complex features.  The differences in the channels was really striking and great to see.\r\n\r\nWeb sites:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.stellarsolace.com/\">StellarSolace</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StellarSolace-1588021434610921/\">Facebook page</a>",
