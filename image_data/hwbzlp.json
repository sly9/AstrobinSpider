    "description": "My goal was to capture as much detail in the core of the Iris Nebula as possible.  I realize to really do justivce to this nebula I probably should have used the C11Edge for maximum resolution.  But I wanted to see what a decent refactor shooting at 1,000 mm could pick up with a small pixel camera.  All in all I am pleased with the resilts, though I am looking forward to revisiting with the Edge.",
