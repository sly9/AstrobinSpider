    "description": "Images from the following two scopes (piggybacked) contributed to this image:\r\nAG12+ASI1600MM at .70 asec/pix (RGB,Ha)\r\nTV127is+ASI183MM at .75 asec/pix. (L,Ha)\r\nThey were all registered to the best R image taken on the AG12.\r\nUsing L from the TV NP127is refractor effectively eliminates the spikes from the AG12.\r\n\r\nLBN 331 is an emission nebula in Cygnus.  This image is the central area of the nebula, which is usually imaged with a much larger FOV than the .58 degree this image spans.  With the very bright star 32Cyg (mag 4) forming the eye, we have a decent image of a very fierce Dragon spitting fire.",
