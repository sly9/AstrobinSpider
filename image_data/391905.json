    "description": "This is Melotte 15, the sculpted formation at the center of emission nebula IC 1805 in Cassiopeia. I've been experimenting with star removal techniques and this is the result.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to enter all the capture data on these forms, but basically it was taken from 30 hours of exposure in two main sessions, nearly eight years apart. It constitutes a mixed focal length image with Ha \"luminance\" data from the SCT and \"color\" data from the refractor. Recently reprocessed to remove the star layer.\r\n\r\n Thanks for looking.",
