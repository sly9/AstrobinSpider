    "description": "NGC6818 is a tiny but delicate planetary nebula. I was fascinated by the image from ESA/Hubble:\r\nhttps://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1531a/\r\nThen I found out that the apparent diameter of it was only 0.3 arc minutes, which was too small to my own gear set. So I tried Chilescope T1. It was still a challenging object, even for RC-1000.",
