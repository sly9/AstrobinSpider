    "description": "On the night of first light with my old Nikon 50mm F/1.8D, shot at F/4.\r\n\r\nThis is a 2x2 panel around the Milky Way centre. I think my polar alignment was a little off (bit of blurring even at 50mm) and it may also explain the panels serious mismatch as they're taken over a 5 hour period.\r\nMy first attempt at a manual mosaic, would usually do it with out EQ6 being controlled by TSX. Need more practice on the less computerised side of things!",
