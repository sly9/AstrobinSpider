    "description": "I started this project with the goal to capture the very faint tidal streams that R. Jay Gabany captured at a very dark site  in New Mexico 12 years ago (June through August 2006).  \r\n\r\nAfter a week, I concluded that my 21.5 average sky was no match for his 21.8+ sky at the time.  Although our equipment is similar, I would need the marine layer cover over San Diego to see a 21.8+ sky. Unfortunately the marine layer was not present as I expected. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, I'm happy with the results. What you see here is the same stretch applied to both the galaxy and the tidal stream. With that, you can see the relative brightness difference and the extensive glow around NGC 5907 that I have not seen in similar attempts at this very elusive galaxy/tidal stream pair. I hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nP.S. The glow at the bottom left is from a very bright out-of-frame star. Although I toned it down a bit, it was too difficult to completely eliminate without damaging the surrounding data. We're still studying the cause.",
