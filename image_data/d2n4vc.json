    "description": "NGC 2683 is a magnitude 10.6 galaxy in the constellation of Lynx, estimated to be between 16 and 25 million light years away. This spiral galaxy is viewed nearly edge-on from our perspective. Because of its appearance, it was nicknamed the \"UFO Galaxy\" by the Astronaut Memorial Planetarium and Observatory site. Note the small yellowish core in the center of the galaxy, consisting of older stars, and the prominent dust lanes, somewhat jumbled by their near edge-on view.   \r\n\r\nDate: Dec 18, 2018 - Mar 5, 2019, processed 1/14/2021\r\nLocation: New Ringgold PA\r\n\r\nOptics: Celestron EdgeHD 1100 on Paramount MX\r\nCamera: Sbig STL-11000 for RGB\r\n\r\nOptics: Starizona Hyperion f/8 12.5 inch, FL 2540 mm on Paramount ME\r\nCamera: Apogee U8300 for Lum\r\n\r\nGuiding: ST-402 on Innovations Foresight On-Axis Guider and STL-11000 Self guiding\r\n\r\nExposure: LRGB: L:96x10 R:36x10 min, G:24x10 min, B:34x10 min for a total of 31.7 hrs (190 subs at avg of 600 sec) \r\n\r\nProcessing: Image acquisition using CCD Autopilot.
