    "description": "NGC 3981 in Crater is an unbarred spiral galaxy located 62 million light-years away in the constellation of Crater. Discovered in 1785 by William Herschel, NGC 3981 is a member of the NGC 4038 Group which also contains the Antennae Galaxies. Both are part of the Virgo Supercluster. Frustrating that so little has been written about this magnificent island universe! It certainly has some of the most interesting extended arms of any spiral galaxy. Many thanks to my collaborator and friend, Mike Selby, who acquired and calibrated this fine data from Observatorio El Sauce, Chile.",
