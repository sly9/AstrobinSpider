    "description": "This is a panorama consisting of 9 panels of 5 images of 25 seconds each. Taken outside the astronomer's dormitory at Cerro Tololo observatory, Chile. The patch on the ground without snow was me running back and forth and trying to warm up, I had never been so cold in my whole life and the cold went to bed with me, it took over an hour just to stop shivering. It was all worth it though, I had never seen a sky so beautiful and clear before, later my friend Eileen joined me, what a wonderful evening. Can you spot the southern cross?",
