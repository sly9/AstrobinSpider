    "description": "Losing a piece of history is sad, indeed.   No matter the circumstances, I will always find inspiration in the human drive to rebuild after suffering significant loss.   \r\n\r\nThis image is a carefully placed composite of the Milky Way over Paris, showing the Notre Dame Cathedral roofline and spire that was destroyed by fire on April 15, 2019.   Modern light pollution would never allow such an image, but with todayâ€™s technology we can visualize a surreal scene from centuries ago.    \r\n\r\nAs an astrophotographer, composites always make me a bit uncomfortable, but this is not pure fantasy. I took some care in determining this astronomical alignment could technically be possible in the morning hours of April in Paris (or at least something very close to it).\r\n\r\nIt's a beautiful view.   Enjoy !",
