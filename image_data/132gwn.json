    "description": "I was questioning myself in the past four months, why am I still doing astrophotography? I bought data online and got fabulous images (with copyrights). I rented telescopes from Chile without worrying about the weather, light pollution, or staying up at night. I also shot nebulae at home with light pollution filters and got good results. But, I just feel not motivated enough to process the data. Probably it’s time to sell the gears and move on? Yesterday we finally got a clear night so I drove to the suburban to set up and take photos of M81 M82 galaxies. The moment when the cloud cleared out and numerous stars shined above me, I suddenly recalled why I got into astrophotography. It’s not (only) about gears, photos, technical challenges. It’s about the experience. Feeling the stars, emerging in the ocean of the gigantic fireballs millions of light years away is a unique experience that cannot be replaced by watching a remote telescope shooting photos for you. It just cannot.",
