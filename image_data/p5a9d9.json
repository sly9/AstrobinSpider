    "description": "NGC 7822 is one of my favourite nebulae, situated in Cepheus at around 3000 ly away. This is a pretty long backyard project, completed with RGB stars. After 30 hours I was pleased to see that this pretty dark nebula turned out brighter than usual and the cumulated exposure time revealed nice details in the periphery. We had some hot nights here and the ASI1600 was very brave, even though in the beggining of the night subs started around -18,5°C. I finally used my -20° Master Dark. Clear skies !",
