    "description": "I had really good seeing on September 5th, but unfortunately I was too late to get the NTB outbreak #2 close to the Central Meridian. Nevertheless, as has been shown in other images, it has developed something of a tail. It is at the upper right in the image. As the numbering suggests it is the second recent breakout in the NTB.\r\n\r\nThis was a particularly interesting conjunction of 3 of Jupiter's largest moons, Ganymede, Io and Callisto. I have yet to process the data with Callisto and this set only includes Ganymede, Io and Io's shadow. With Ganymede and Io being in front of the planet, excellent surface detail was resolved, in fact some of the best I have seen and a very good correlation with NASA images of the anti-Jovian Hemisphere of both moons (see the mouse over for detail with the recognisable features annotated). Once again, being in front of the planet allows the avoidance of the Gibbs Phenomenon, which is exacerbated by the wavelet sharpening. Note that I processed data for Ganymede when it was subsequently in front of the planet and then used a layer mask to replace the more blurry original version from the data for this image.",
