    "description": "The Seahorse Nebula is a dark nebula surrounded by dust and H-Alpha. A dark nebula or absorption nebula is a type of interstellar cloud that is so dense that it obscures the visible wavelengths of light from objects behind it, such as background stars and emission or reflection nebulae. The extinction of the light is caused by interstellar dust grains located in the coldest, densest parts of molecular clouds.\n\nAnother one captured under dark skies! I spent an entire evening pointed at this target to ensure I could do it justice. I prefer this image rotated via portrait but for the sake of astrobin's framing I've uploaded it landscape. I learned a few things while processing this. It really does help to separate the stars from things like this. They're already super bright and to enhance some of the fainter dust you need to stretch the image a bit more. So I removed every star, made changes, and reintegrated them later on. This really helped me boost the contrast between the dark sky and the brown stuff. Really cool! I hope you like the image!",
