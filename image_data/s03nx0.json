    "description": "Finally I have more time again to process my images. :-) I would like to start with this HaLRGB of the well-known emssion nebula IC 405. In order to be able to show the structures of the \"flaming star\" and thus the reflection parts of the nebula, I decided to work on the very strong H-Alpha together with the luminance. Embedded in the RGB background, the result is, in my opinion, a very deep and (despite the large H-Alpha portion) a very harmonious image. \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it! :-)",
