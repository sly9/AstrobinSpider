    "description": "This HaSHO composition is the epitome of expressionism.  If only Van Gough had a telescope.  Then again, maybe this is what he saw on a daily basis peering into the landscape of his mind.\r\n\r\nThis is data from two scopes.  A dozen of so hours were captured with the FSQ and .6x reducer.  I combined the data to improve SNR and depth.  The stars suffered, for the FSQ was slightly miscollimated (and I don't think teh stars in the FSQ at F3 are as good as teh stars from the TOA in any case).",
