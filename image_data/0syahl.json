    "description": "This took over one month to capture data for. I originally planned to capture a 2:1 ratio of O3 to HA but instead tried capturing O3 at 2/3 (200) gain while leaving HA at 1/8 gain (75). This was a bad idea as the O3 stars were larger with no real benefit from the lower read noise at higher gain, especially since most of these subs were sky fog limited due to being shot through the July haze.",
