    "description": "After I was losing the battle to dew pointing at the sculptor galaxy (basically vertical), I switched to this second target for some images.  Originally was images captured over two nights, but the second night images were all too poor quality to keep (focus/collimation is what I suspect).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for my sleep deprived self I moved the camera after passing the meridian, in order to find a guide star, before I remembered to take flats. This resulted in 11x guided, 5-minute, non-flat calibrated, images at ISO-1600. (hello dust!). Collimation and focus from the first night was fairly decent for a second attempt (at collimating an SCT), but I'm sure it should be better.\r\n\r\nThis time I also tried using a mix of arcsinh stretch followed with histogram stretch to avoid the strange red/blue halo around stars. Overall, I think it came out alright for only 11 images, if I ever get a chance in the next few weeks I might try adding some more data.\r\n\r\nOne more image to run through, lucky last being the sculptor galaxy set",
