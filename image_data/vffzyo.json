    "description": "The Horsehead and Flame remain one of my favorite targets.  Probably because this was the second target I ever shot.  I was outside in my driveway on a FREEZING cold night in February.  My best friend came over to drink a few beers and suffer the cold with me.  I can remember him looking at the screen and saying \"I don't see anything like the picture you showed me\" and I told him \"Just wait...It's in there.\"  That image <a href=\"https://astrob.in/390391/0/\">shown here</a> is terrible, but I was so excited when I processed it.  It was taken with my Celestron Edge HD 8 with Hyperstar.  This one was taken with slightly better equipment and from slightly better skies.  Still, every time I see it I remember that night the first time I shot it.",
