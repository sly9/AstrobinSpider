    "description": "Another interesting animation with the shadow of Europa marking the surface of Jupiter and Io coming out behind the planet.\r\nUnfortunately the seeing was not as good as in the previous Gif, even so a lot of details are visible.\r\nI wish I had taken a longer catch, taking the transit from Europe, but the clouds ended early with my party!\r\nApril, 19-2019; 06:16 to 06:47 UT\r\n13 JPG pictures",
