This cloud is one of the closest star forming regions to the solar system.  The declination of this field is between Milkyway and the southern Pole at DEC -72. It can be observed exclusively from the regions of the very southern hemisphere.  The Globular cluster is NGC4372 with a size of 18.6  arcmin and  Mag 7.24 brightness.\r\n                                          \r\nExposures: \r\n19xR, 17xG and 13xB filter using a SBIG ST11K on a Takahashy FSQ 106 with 530 mm focal length on a Paramount ME mount.\r\n\r\nAll images were exposed remotely on the T12 of Siding Spring iTelescop Farm.\r\nMarch and April  2016.",
