It is very difficult to image in any detail due to its very low surface brightness. It can mainly be imaged with H-alpha filters but it also has a small but definate OIII component. vdB159 is very small (1.5 arcmin) reflection nebula adjacent to magnitude 7.68 star BD +61 2573. Since it is not worth imaging by itself, I thought a better composition was to include CTB1.",
