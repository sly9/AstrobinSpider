    "description": "I've started the galaxy season with an object I#ve imaged nearly one year ago together with a comet.\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/2ewnzr/0/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/2ewnzr/0/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\"/></a>\r\nThe setup has changed significantly.\r\n1. This time I used my \"Baby Newton\"\r\n2. Instead of an DSLR a cooled ASI did the job.\r\n\r\nI am very surprised how this duo is performing. The result is just a 61x60 sec integration only processed with the light pollution tool in APP and a little stretching.\r\n\r\nAs I am struggling much more with balancing etc. with the 10\" Newton, I would asume I will stick a while with the Baby ;-)",
