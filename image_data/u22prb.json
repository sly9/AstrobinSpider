    "description": "Still my favourite object of all, the great jewel of the Southern sky. I intend to image it every year cos I love it so much, but also as a benchmark to how I improve over the years as a photographer. Gotta respect milestones, and this one is spectacular!\r\n\r\nThe tactic this year was to take hundreds of short (20s) shots, and cull them heavily to distill the better image. I think 20s works great - gives balanced detail and colour without the core overwhelming everything. For the first time I did NOT have to use HDR Multiscale to pull the core back, which made me happy.",
