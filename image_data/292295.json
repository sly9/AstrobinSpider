    "description": "I found an Orion Starblast, a smallish \"entry level\" fairly fast newtonian, on Craigslist still in the box for a good price.  I also had a Siebert 1.25\" coma corrector I wasn't using, so thought I'd put the two together and try some imaging.\r\n\r\nI was rather impressed with the results. For a total of $150 (including the new focuser, but not including the CC), I have a pretty good, lower FL scope  (535mm with the CC) to compliment the 1220mm FL 8\" newtonian and the light weight and lower FL ride well on the CG4 mount.
