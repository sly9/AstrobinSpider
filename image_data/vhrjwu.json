    "description": "The Heart Nebula, IC1805, lies around 7500 ly distant in the constellation Cassiopeia. This emission nebulae is riddled with dark dust lanes within ionized hydrogen gas. In this wide-field view of the Heart nebula, the open cluster Melotte 15 contains several bright stars that are up to 50 times more massive than our sun is located near center. The intense radiation from these stars drive the output of this emission nebula. The Fish-head nebula is in the upper right. Riddled throughout the frame are filaments of dark nebulae.",
