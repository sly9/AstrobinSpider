    "description": "This object is a spiral galaxy located 40 million light-years away in the constellation of Antlia (the Air Pump).\r\n\r\nThe galaxy appears to be face-on but it is really at an angle of about 45 degrees to us.  To me, it has the classic galaxy shape - graceful spiraling arms, many blue star clusters, pinkish star formation regions, and clearly defined dark lanes spiraling into the core.  The arm below the core has an interesting wavy shape.  The core appears brighter and more yellow than normal, and is believed to host a supermassive black hole .\r\n\r\nDespite the southerly declination of -31 degrees and the resulting low altitude of the obejct, I am pleased with the amount of detail in the image.",
