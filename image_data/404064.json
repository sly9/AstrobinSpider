    "description": "I have been hoping to image the GRS to capture the interesting cloud formation I have seen in the images of others, but clouds have been spoiling the party.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was cloudy when I went to bed this particular night, so I expected to miss it again. However, when I woke in the middle of the night transparency had improved to decent levels, so I rushed to grab some frames before the GRS rotated out of view.\r\n\r\nThis did, however, mean my 'scope had no time to reach thermal equilibrium, so I had some (very local) seeing issues. Happy with the result, considering this!\r\n\r\nVery interesting to see the solid line of brown cloud from the SEB being drawn completely around the GRS. I wonder whether this has anything to do with the bright/white eddy that is trailing the GRS ... perhaps this disturbance is helping to divert the clouds around the GRS.\r\n\r\nThe main image is a series of 5 separate stacks (each 90s long) de-rotated in WinJUPOS.\r\n\r\nA single wider-field capture (including Io) is presented in rev B.",
