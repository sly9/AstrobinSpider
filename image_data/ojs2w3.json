    "description": "Here we have my attempt at NGC253 The Sculptor Galaxy.  \r\n\r\nThis one is an intermediate spiral located about 11.5 million light years away in Sculptor.  It is also a starburst galaxy with a lot of star formation currently ongoing.  It is about 90,000 lys in diameter which places it at about the same size as our Milky Way.\r\n\r\nFinally the smoke from the West Coast fires has subsided and that has afforded me the opportunity to get back to the telescope.  This subject is located rather low in our skies at 33 degrees north latitude which allow for only a few hours of imaging per session.  I have found that the quality of the sub-frames really increases once a subject attains an altitude of 30 degrees.  This one was really a pleasure to do and actually went very smoothly from start to finish.  Not even a big fight to process this one either, although is is very bright comparatively speaking. \r\n\r\nI've seen a lot of images of this galaxy with varying levels of saturation.  So I did struggle a bit with where I should be in that regard.  The struggle for me is that I usually save my images to the staging area and then view them with different devices.  My MS laptop which I think has an excellent monitor, my desktop I use for processing, my IPAD and my cellphone.  The images look very different device to device.  That to me is where the struggle lies.  But I'm sure I am preaching to the choir with this problem, lol...\r\n\r\nI hope you like it, clear skies and good health to you all!",
