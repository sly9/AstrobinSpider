    "description": "Paul Hickson is a Canadian astronomer who, in 1994, published ‘Atlas of Compact Groups of Galaxies’ – discovered by searching of the Palomar Sky Survey prints.  Hickson galaxy group number 44 is comprised of NGC 3190, NGC 3187, NGC 3193 and NGC 3185.  Hickson 44 is located around 100 million light years away in the constellation of Leo.  Three of the galaxies (NGC 3190, NGC 3187 & NGC 3193) are catalogued as object number 316 in Halton Arp’s ‘Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies’ (1966).\r\n\r\nNumerous other galaxies of varying sizes can also be seen in this field\r\n\r\nThe Hickson 44 group was photographed between 7 February and 3 March 2019 from a remote imaging rig in Spain owned and operated by Barry Wilson and Steve Milne.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\nTelescope: TEC140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nLum: 36 x 600s\r\nRed: 24 x 600s\r\nGreen: 24 x 600s\r\nBlue: 24 x 600s\r\n\r\nA total of 18 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\n\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
