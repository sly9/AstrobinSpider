    "description": "This amazing object is a reflection and emission nebula located 1,300 light-years away in the constellation of Orion. \r\n\r\nThe reflection nebula is most prominent in the center of the image where it is lit up by stars that are forming inside of the dust cloud.  The cloud obscures many young stars, which can only be seen in the infrared.  Although the nebula is brightest at the center, it also extends down and to the left out of the frame. A wide path of reddish hydrogen gas arcs over the top of the nebula and is surrounded by a rich and colorful star field.  The main nebula section in the center of the image is small - less than 5 minutes in diameter. \r\n\r\nUnlike many nicknames, the central reflection nebula actually resembles a fox looking right at me, with two glowing eyes, a nose, and a distinctive head shape.  The nebula is also said to resemble a Cosmic Bat.",
