When one participates in such a moment, everything takes on a different color. I am going to Podlasie, in a forest covered with snow, because the very banks. I am surprised that I gladly open the window at -12 C and, walking slowly, I listen to the snow sounds of tires on the frozen snow, it has not been such a long time. Being in such places, I already know why winter fairy tales and fairy tales were created. Beautiful winter, 40 cm‚ùÑ of snow and -12 C   frost. \r\n\r\nSiemiony, Podlasie, POLAND üáµüá±\r\n31/01/2021\r\nCanon EOS R mod plus Sigma 28mm f1.4 ART \r\n22 x 15s ISO3200 @ f2.0 Panorama\r\n\r\nSocial\r\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/lukaszzakphoto\r\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/lukaszzak/",
