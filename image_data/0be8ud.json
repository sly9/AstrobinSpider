    "description": "This has to be one of my favourite narrowband targets. Messier 8 (Lagoon nebula) in Ha[OIII] bicolor. I imaged this target last year when I had the Canon 250D/Astronomik 12nm clip-in NB filters as my imaging system. Now that I have the QHY268M/Antlia 3nm NB filters I couldnâ€™t resist but to have another go! My understanding of the bicolor process has been that the RGB channels are assigned HOO. But after experimenting with different approaches, I found that I could get a result I liked even better if I went HHO and then processed in Photoshop in a manner not too dissimilar from the way I process my SHO images. Probably just boils down to personal taste!",
