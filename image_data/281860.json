    "description": "This is a composite Ha and LRGB image with data collected over a three year period with a variety of cameras on my Takahashi FSQ85. There are 300s and 600s subs for circa 14hrs of LRGB and 600s for circa 3hrs of Ha.\r\n\r\nThe older images were never completed to my satisfaction with neither sufficient data (I only have a limited imaging window with Orion over my house before it disappears behind a neighbour's tree) nor waiting to capture under ideal moonless conditions or when the town switches off the streetlights.\r\n\r\nCaptured at F5.3 and F3.9; using a QSI683-wsg8, Atik 383L+ and Atik 460EXM; Baader and Astrodon filters. January 2014 - 17.\r\n\r\nThe various image scales were combined in PixInsight with relative ease and quite a severe crop to take account of the various scope/ccd combinations and rotations.  Still a little noisy in the background wash of Ha in this area, however, after many iterations, I need to move on to other projects and am quite pleased with this image for now.",
