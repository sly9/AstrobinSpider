    "description": "I was not happy with the recent picture of M31. Although I was able to collect a decent amount of subs it turned out very noisy and there was a lack of detail. The sky seemed clear during that time but I think there was haze or invisible cirrus clouds.\r\n\r\nLast night I visited M31 again, this time the subs look much better. Also the final result is much more appealing. I am happy with that but, as always, more subs would have been better...\r\n\r\nThanks to a fellow Astrobin Member (Frank - http://www.astrobin.com/users/zishor) I am using APT instead of Backyard EOS. I am totally convinced by the plate solving: You let APT take a picture, plate solve it and it will slew automatically to the object you choose... it almost feels like cheating. No time lost with aligning the mount and taking a lot of framing shots. Perfect! :)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJan",
