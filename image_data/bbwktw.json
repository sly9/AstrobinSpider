    "description": "NGC 1909 (also IC 2118 and The Witch Head Nebula) is a gas cloud, which may also be an ancient supernova remnant, is located in the constellation Orion at a distance of approximately 1,000 light-years from Earth and shines at an apparent magnitude of 13, so it's VERY faint.  It's illuminated by the nearby supergiant star Rigel.  Due to the nature of the dust particles in the nebula, it reflects blue light more so than red, thus giving some parts a predominately blue color.\r\nThis is a 2 panel mosaic (I'm not good at mosaics) taken at Deep Sky West-Chile with the TOA-150/FLI ML16200 in LRGB with a total exposure time of 21.83 hours.  I processed this in Pixinsight using the PhotometricMosaic method (first time I ever used this).  I've shot this with my equipment but it's never had a data set as good as this is.  I'll probably make some revisions cause this is my first run on this data.\r\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\r\nTom",
