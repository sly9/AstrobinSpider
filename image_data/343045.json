    "description": "There probably exist more pictures of M13 then the number of stars it contains.\r\nHowever I picked this object to test the resolution capabilities/resolving power of my telescope. The relative short total exposure time of around 4 hours was gathered under good seeing conditions (1.1\" - 1.4\")\r\nPlease check the full resolution version to appreciate it to its fullest :-)",
