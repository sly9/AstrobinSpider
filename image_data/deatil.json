    "description": "NGC 4651 (The Umbrella Galaxy, also Arp 189) is a spiral galaxy some 62 million light years away in Coma Berenices.  About the size of the Milky Way, it has a faint umbrella-shaped structure that extends to the east some 100,000 light years beyond the galactic disk.  It is composed of tidal star streams - remnants of a much smaller galaxy that has been torn apart by NGC 4651's tidal forces.  It is included in Halton Arp's catalog as Arp 189 - \"galaxy with filaments.\"  Unlike most spiral galaxies of the Virgo Cluster, NGC 4651 is rich in neutral hydrogen.  (Wikipedia, APOD 2014)\r\n\r\nTaken over several nights:  March 4, 6-8, 10 and 14-15, 2021.",
