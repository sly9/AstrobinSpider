    "description": "Not being able to travel to dark skies due to the pandemic, I was craving for LRGB imaging, so I gave it a shot to M20 from my suburban backyard observatory. Was lucky to enjoy excellent seeing during Lum acquisition. Collected 3 hours of Lum and one hour of each color channel. Given the brightness of the object, results are reasonable, although the background is always a challenge under these conditions.",
