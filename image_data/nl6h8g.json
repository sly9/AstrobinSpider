    "description": "Hi everybody!\r\nThis is a new revision of an old image acquired in 2012 on the Austrian Alps during the tests of the first Officina Stellare RH200 Veloce prototype. We started imaging with a color filter set which was not so good at that time then we change for a better one and, at the moment of the first edit of the image, I decided to discard a great part of the exposures for that. Today's software technology has finally allowed me to include these datas with a good color calibration process giving me a nice improvement of the total integration time. Meanwhile I've also acquired some other datas of the area using both my mobile and fixed remote setups. Precious integration time to use! First one (mobile) was acquired trough a Takahashi Epsilon 210 f3 while other exposure from the (fixed) Officina Stellare RiFast 400 f3.8. Total exposure time is now about 30 Hrs of good LRGB data.\r\nThe field was the original one with the Veloce and isa about 3Â° on diagonal thanks to the 11K Full Frame sensor.\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by.",
