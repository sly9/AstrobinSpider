    "description": "Here is a look at the largest active region so far for 2017 from 09:15 to 13:15 UT in very variable seeing conditions, the sequence starts with a C4.0 event followed by a B9.8 and a C5.3 solar flare events. A large prominence can be seen on the eastern solar limb. With a 4-hour animation it is easy to see the rotation of the Sun itself in this sequence. About 14 hours work in this one!\r\n\r\nHope people like it.\r\n\r\nAndy",
