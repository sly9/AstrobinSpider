    "description": "A two panel mosaic of the Veil Nebula Complex captured during one night. Quite difficult to process due to the many stars in the field of view! The yellowish glow to the right of NGC 6960 (the Western part of the Veil Nebula a.k.a. the Witch's Broom) with bright star 52 Cygni is not a colour gradient but actual dust or nebulas. The same is true for the tornado shaped grey 'smudge' in the lower right corner.",
