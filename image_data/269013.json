    "description": "NGC 7640 is a medium size but dim galaxy in Camelopardalis. It has a low surface brightness, and the lack of symmetry in the arms shows signs of interaction with another galaxy.\r\n\r\nI have posted two versions - in the first, I removed any luminosity gradient in PixInsight. In the second, I left it in - a version of this galaxy by [Bob Franke](http://bf-astro.com/ngc7640/ngc7640.htm) shows IFN in the same areas I was seeing the gradient - but of course it might just be a gradient :).",
