    "description": "Occasionally referred to as a galactic Eye of Sauron, NGC 4151 is a Seyfert Galaxy housing one of the most active supermassive black holes in our neighborhood.   Actually, a binary black hole is thought to be at the core, one of 40 million solar masses and the other 10 million.  They are believed to orbit each other every 15.8 years, but there is still some controversy regarding their existence.  Its distance historically has been measured to be close to 40 million light years.  However, in 2014 a team using a clever technique called Echo Mapping, discovered the galaxy to be closer to 62 million.  Its neighbor directly above it in the image, NGC 4156, is 260 Mly distant and has a tidal tail.  To it’s right is UGC 7188, some 322 Mly from earth.  There are three major galaxy clusters in this image.  One of them, XMMXCS J1208.4+3928 is located in the lower left of the image and has a Z value of .220 which translates roughly to 3.7 Gly  Note a tidal element directly below NGC 4151.\r\n\r\nWith the hope of not burning out the core, I decided to try both 600 and 120 second subframes, using the later for the core.  Total imaging time was 34.4 hours. \r\n\r\nDuring the challenging events of this past year I have had time to pause and consider things that matter most.  I am grateful for the gift of our Creators Cosmos that surrounds us. Reminding me of God’s power and love for us.  Mark Twain once invited us to consider our earth as a single drop of water in a beautiful storm of beauty that we are part of…\r\n\r\n“When we contemplate the whole globe as one great dewdrop, striped and dotted with continents and islands, flying through space with other stars all singing and shining together as one, the whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty”  \r\n(Travels in Alaska, John Muir, 1915, Chap 1, p.5)\r\n\r\n\r\nImage Acquisition info:\r\n\r\nLocation: Starlodge Observatory\r\nDate: April 2020\r\nScope:  AstroTech 16, Ritchey Chretien\r\nCamera: Atik 16200\r\nLRGBHa:\r\nL\t120s  58 \t6960\r\n\t600s  82\t49200\r\nR\t120s  23\t2760\r\n\t600s  24\t14400\r\nG\t120s  24\t2880\r\n\t600s  28\t16800\r\nB\t120s  24\t2880\r\n\t600s  27\t16200\r\nHa\t900s  13\t11700\r\n\t\t\t123,780/3600=34.4 hrs",
