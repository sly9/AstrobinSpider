    "description": "This is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation of Dorado. Its nucleus is a Seyfert Type 2, associated with a starburst region. NGG 1672’s four arms are not symmetrical. One is much brighter than its counterpart on the opposite side of the galaxy.\r\n\r\nNGC 1672 is a “peculiar” galaxy, appearing in the Catalog of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and Associations, by Halton Arp and Barry Madore. It is listed as “Category 8: Galaxies with Apparent Companions.” These companions are thought to be interacting with the dominant galaxy, NGC 1672.\r\n\r\nAccording to the catalog, “The galaxies that are nearest in space to us, and that we therefore know the most about, are almost all grouped together in units of one large, dominant galaxy, and a retinue of smaller companions. Examples are the Local Group (dominated by M31) and the M81 and M101 groups.”\r\n\r\nTech Notes for ASA 500/3.6:\r\nASA Newtonian, 500 mm aperture, 1900mm focal length, F3.6\r\nFLI Proline 16803, 9 mm pixel, 4096 X 4096\r\nASA DDM85 equatorial mount\r\nProcessing with PixInsight, StarTools, and Affinity Photo",
