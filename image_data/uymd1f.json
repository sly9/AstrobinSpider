    "description": "Taken during London's coronavirus lockdown.  Weather has been really kind given what is going out in the \"real world\".  Seeing was not great but I managed to accumulate 18 hours of luminance over five nights on this project.   I had never imaged M63 before, despite over 20yrs imaging!  I was aiming to capture the tidal arms extending beyond the galaxy as shown here:\r\n\r\nhttps://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080417.html\r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/403276/0/?real=&nc=user  \r\nhttps://www.astrobin.com/408924/0/?real=&nc=user\r\n\r\nThis was too difficult to do from London but by overstretching the L frame you can see a hint of them.  Hopefully they did not become too washed out in the LRGB final version.  \r\nCheck the annotated version again for the many small and medium galaxies in the background. Most interesting is what I thought was an extension of a spiral arm of M63 but which turns out to be a satellite galaxy of the main object; although may still be disputed (http://www.williamsseaandsky.com/?page_id=2025).",
