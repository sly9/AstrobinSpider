    "description": "Setting out to capture IC 289 was my biggest challenge ever at only 0.50 arc minutes. I wanted to see how much detail I could resolve through integration time and processing compared to what was done from the Mount Lemmon SkyCenter Schulman Telescope that is 32\" in size:\r\n\r\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IC289_Planetary_Nebula_from_the_Mount_Lemmon_SkyCenter_Schulman_Telescope_courtesy_Adam_Block.jpg\r\n\r\n I was pretty happy with my results. My image scale was 0.68\"/pixel, but doubled the resolution in Photoshop before my final processing.\r\n\r\nFormerly a star like our Sun, it is now just a cloud of ionized gas being pushed out into space by the remnants of the star’s core, visible as a small bright dot in the middle of the cloud. It was discovered by Lewis Swift in early September 1888. It lies close to the 10th magnitude star BD +60° 0631.",
