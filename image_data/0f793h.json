    "description": "Short animation. I hoped for 1 hour BUT clouds rolled in and so I stopped after 40 minutes. I could see a pretty nice surge prom when I was setting up.  The hedgerow prom was pretty active. There is some interesting activity near 2876/2785 with filament movement and nice prom activity. I wish I used my double stack system. I also caught a little flare at 2786 (will appear black with inverted disk).\r\n\r\nIt takes a while to load since itâ€™s 70mb\r\n\r\nI captured 1000 frames every 30 seconds (140 FPS)\r\n\r\nAS3 to batch stack. I stacked 75 frames\r\nIMPPG to sharpen and apply tone curves\r\nImPPG to batch align\r\nPixinsight\r\n-Crop, linear fit due to changing intensity,  RGB, LHE, Color (see 2nd upload)\r\n\r\nFinal is 20FPS.",
