    "description": "One more June object. (-:\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for M16 and The Crescent Nebula to come into view, I'd aim for NGC 4565 from 9:15 PM (66°) to 11 PM (44°).\r\n\r\nMy goal was to get very detailed in the center, thus only keeping the very best subs over a 10-day dark period.\r\n\r\nFortunately this resulted in 16 15-minute luminance subs (4 hours) with FWHM between 1.85\" and 2.21\". (-:\r\n\r\nSkies were very dark (21.7 SQM) so 2-hours of each R, G and B (rather than my normal 3 hours) provided very good color and low noise.\r\n\r\n\"NGC 4565 (also known as the Needle Galaxy or Caldwell 38) is an edge-on spiral galaxy about 30 to 50 million light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices.\r\n\r\nNGC 4565 is a giant spiral galaxy more luminous than the Andromeda Galaxy.Much speculation exists in literature as to the nature of the central bulge. \r\n\r\nIn the absence of clear-cut dynamical data on the motions of stars in the bulge, the photometric data alone cannot adjudge among various options put forth. However, its exponential shape suggested that it is a barred spiral galaxy.\r\n\r\nNGC 4565 has at least two satellite galaxies, one of which is interacting with it. It has a population of roughly 240 globular clusters, more than the Milky Way.\"",
