    "description": "A great target that really shines with the use of the RCOS 14.5\". Getting closer and closer to what I personally enjoy with galaxy colors. Colors in general seem to be what I have been tackling these past few months though whether it is nebulae, galaxies, narrowband, etc., colors always seem to be what I spend my time trying to perfect as it seems I am sort of approaching the limit of sharpening and noise reduction with my current understandings of different sharpening and noise reduction tools. While I would be happy to try new approaches there, color is still something that I am no where near as comfortable with relatively speaking when compared to the other two topics. My main grip with this image is some artifacts on the colors of the stars. Not sure what I could have done to prevent them since they show up in the unedited RGB image, but I could have most likely done some things to help prevent bringing them out at the very least. I considered clone stamping them all even, but in the end decided they were hardly noticeable and didn't warrant hours of clone stamping to fix. Just try to do better next time.",
