    "description": "I recently had the opportunity to visit Maui and took a night to spend the evening atop Haleakala at the national park. This is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I don't know of another publicly accessible place better for night sky imaging or astrophotography! The skies were glorious, and well above the clouds.\r\n\r\nCanon 5D Mark III\r\nISO 3200, 25 seconds.\r\nRokinon 14mm f/2.8 shot wide open. \r\nCropped slightly from the original.",
