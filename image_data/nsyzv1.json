    "description": "Here we have the results of an effort to try to capture The California Nebula (NGC1499) in Perseus.  \r\n\r\nThis is an subject we are all familiar with and I thought it would be another good test project with the FRA400 quintuplet.  I continue to be really impressed.  It is sure nice to get the great majority of this without having to do a mosaic.  Still, I think the image is pretty flat edge to edge and despite the little bit of blue that was not well controlled I continue to be quite pleased with the little refractor.\r\n\r\nOf course, any comments/criticism always welcome and clear skies and good health to the AB community,",
