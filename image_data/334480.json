    "description": "Excuse me for the catchy name, I was so thrilled when i captured the first Oiii frame I yelled OMG, and the penny dropped; I thought Oh my Gourd so I decided to  stick to this...\r\n\r\nI started imaging this object in Feb 2017; all from home I spent endless hours mostly frustrated with bad weather. I really wanted to get more Ha frames to enhance the red nebulosity but weather just wont allow me...and the object was becoming too low to image. Very pleased with the result, still I might continue imaging next year.\r\n\r\nHope you like it\r\n\r\nRevison B: Corrected object description",
