    "description": "Interesting subject, first time I imaged it. (Or anything else for a long period of cloudy weather).  Almost everything went wrong during setup and did not get started when planned.  (Us old folks need retraining after long weather delays).  Only got part of the O3 images and none of the S2 before the subject disappeared behind my neighbors giant sequoia tree.  Plan to get more data on the next clear night.  However, since the forecast is bad for the near future  I processed what was available and uploaded it.",
