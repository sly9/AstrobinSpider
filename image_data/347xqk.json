    "description": "This is the Red Rectangle- made famous by an HST image. The picture captured here, at the time, was the highest resolution ground-based image of it in full (RGB) color! The HST picture is wonderful..but the filters are not broadband and  the colors are mapped. So... no one (in the astrophotography community) knew what color(s) it actually was! (Spoiler... it is mostly red. lol )\r\n\r\nSoon after,  many aficionados began to try to capture this as well (not but a few weeks later the Chart32 team in Chile with the same size telescope were inspired to do so.). I think this image still stands the test of time.  \r\n\r\nThis object also represents a high density DIQ example. Consider the ratio of the amount of time spent on the number of pixels the object subtends. Throughout my career I have never shied away from these- although it is hard to do with so many much larger/brighter baubles in the sky.\r\n\r\nIf you like these kinds of images, please like an follow me!\r\nThanks,\r\n-adam",
