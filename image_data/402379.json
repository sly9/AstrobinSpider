    "description": "Another capture taken the same morning as my recent <a href='https://www.astrobin.com/402189/B/'>Jupiter plus Io image</a>.\r\n\r\nSeeing remained good and transparency had improved somewhat by this stage (definitely more consistent) so I was able to grab a series of captures for de-rotating in WinJUPOS. This image is a combination of five 90 second captures, with around 1,500-1,800 frames stacked in each.\r\n\r\nDepending on the monitor you use to view this, you may be able to make out the C ring. Hints of storm activity are also present, including in the polar region (just south of the polar hexagon).",
