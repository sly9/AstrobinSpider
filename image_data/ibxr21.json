    "description": "My fisrt solo image of the Southern Sky made with Sadr in Chili with a refractor of 127mm. \r\nAt the beginning of August , my first session with this object gave me an idea of what I could get with more  light subs. \r\nI wanted to get the kind of halo around the galaxy . I also wanted to get the red nodules with some Halpha. \r\nThis Galaxy needs attention and  some processing to get the finiest details inside  the very bright core.\r\n\r\nRed 19subs@300s -20°C gain high\r\nBlue 15subs@300s -20°C gain high\r\nGreen 15subs@300s -20°C gain high\r\nLight 71subs@300s -20°C, gain high\r\nHalpha 25 subs@300s -20°C, gain high\r\n\r\n3 Nights : 01/02 , 28/08, 29/30 of August",
