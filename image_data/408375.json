    "description": "Taken over 2 different holidays in Spain:\r\n DSLR in 2017\r\nAtik460EX Luminance only 2019\r\nand combined \r\nNifty 50 lens @ F3.5\r\nDSLR approx 4 hours using Nifty 50 & Zoom lens\r\nLum 30 x 3mins + 16 x 2 mins combined\r\nIoptron Skytracker (unguided)\r\n\r\nNot happy with the nebulosity around and below Antares itself but I think I need to be \r\nsomewhere with a telescope rather than a camera lens to do this any better. N.B. see next comment) \r\n\r\nPS: I found some old data from 2013 taken with a scope from Kent UK, Atik383L and WO Zs71 which only covers a small area, but does cover the Antares region and  globular cluster that I was unhappy about and it extends up to Al Niyat, so I blended that in and am happier with that area now.",
