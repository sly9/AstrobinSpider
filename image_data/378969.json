    "description": "M65, or NGC 3623, is a mag 9.3 (visual) galaxy  in Leo, part of the triplett with M66 and NGC 3628.  It is estimated at 35 million light years distance.  \r\nIt is close to and thus under the gravitational influence of its neighbors but M65 looks like a very \"normal\" Sa type spiral shows little influence. It has a prominent central lens and tightly wound spiral arms, plus a prominent dust lane marking the facing edge. The luminous disk is dominated by a smooth old stellar population. Near the lane, some knots are visible, which may be associated with star forming regions. The lane may hide regions of star formation usually associated with such features in spiral galaxies.\r\n\r\nImaging data:\r\nDate: Mar 24,26,28,30 2008 reprocessed in Nov 2018\r\nLocation: New Ringgold PA\r\nOptics: Meade LX200R 12 inch at f/10\r\nMount: Paramount ME\r\nCamera: SBIG ST-8XME / CFW-8\r\nGuiding: ST-8XME integral guiding chip controlled by Maxim CCD\r\nExposure: LRGB: Luminance: 16x10 minutes unbinned; RGB: 8 each binned 2x2 - 8 min for R,G, and 9 min for B.  Total 6 hours, 40 subs at avg of 540 seconds\r\nProcessing: Image acquisition using CCD Autopilot. Initial processing was done using Maxim DL with subsequent processing with Photoshop.",
