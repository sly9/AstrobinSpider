    "description": "Deep-Sky at the limit\r\nI am looking for photons that have been travelling for 11 billion years, well ahead of the time of our Earth. Of course, it is borderline to resolve the parachute with 1000mm üòê Nevertheless, the detection of the quasar is quite successful.\r\n\r\nWe speaks of a: Bright Quadruply Lensed Quasar at z=2.377\r\n\r\nThrough the gravitational lens of a galaxy in front of it, we see a quadruple image. If we succeed in resolving this, we see the shape of a \"parachute\", hence the name \"Andromeda's parachute\".\r\n\r\nEnclosed the position: RA: 01h 47m 09s, DE: +46¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ 37‚Ä≥ in the constellation - Andromeda and the object name: J014709+463037\r\nPicture verified with ALADIN / Simbad\r\nFor me, these are the magic moments that open the space for fantasy and fascination of the hobby.\r\nWith better seeing I will repeat the attempt - (at the recording 10.11.2020 - it was between 2-3)",
