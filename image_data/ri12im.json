    "description": "This is the third time I have attempted to image M81 - Bode's Galaxy.  It is a beautiful grand design spiral galaxy located 12 million light-years from Earth. It is approximately 90,000 light years across, making it about 1/2 the size of the Milky Way. M81 has an active galactic nucleus which harbors a supermassive black hole that is 70 million times the mass of our sun. The galaxy is located in Ursa Major. It was discovered in 1774 by Johann Elert Bode.\r\n\r\nI wasn't quite happy with this image.  Perhaps one day I'll get it right!",
