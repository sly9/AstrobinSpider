    "description": "Hi,👋🌌✨\r\n\r\nI love coming back to this special place and photographing the stars! In the area of ​​Ziołowy Zakątek there is also a unique monument - a 17th-century wooden church⛪️, which was reconstructed together with the biblical herb garden. This is what we see in my photo, which will be completed by the rising Milky Way🌌! \r\n\r\n09/03/2021\r\nPodlasie, POLAND 🇵🇱\r\nCanon EOS R mod : 20 x15s @ f1.8 ISO3200\r\nSigma 28mm f1.4 ART, Tripod. \r\n\r\nSocial:\r\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/lukaszzak/",
