Among the various HII clouds is are a number of  ‘supershells’ or ‘superbubbles’, which are cavity within a bubble carved out by supernovae and stellar winds.  The somewhat bluer clouds (e.g., NGC 2020, and the area around NGC 2040) are reflection nebulae from embedded clusters young, hot stars. The young stars that generated the bubbles are visible in these bubbles. Over the entire image, the tars are so abundant that the entire image has a sandy, grainy appearance. The image includes stars below magnitude 21.54, according to in the catalogs I can access. \r\nSpeaking of ‘Superbubbles,’ our solar system lies near the center of an old superbubble, the “Local Bubble”, which is roughly 300 light-years across and contains an average of 1/10 as many atoms/cm3 as the surrounding areas of the Milky Way.",
