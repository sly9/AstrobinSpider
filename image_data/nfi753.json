    "description": "If you have witnessed the aurora you know that it can change quite rapidly.\r\nIn this picture some highlights from a particularly active night at the shores of the glacial lake Jökulsárlón in Iceland\r\n\r\nI changed the position a bit to capture the action in the sky  and as the intensity varied quite a lot, I also changed ISO. The top image is 20s at ISO 3200, the middle and bottom image are 20s at ISO 800.\r\nThe 14mm lens was used wide open at f2.8",
