    "description": "Still working on my planetary images...  but I think I'm making progress.  \r\n\r\nWe're almost at the end of the road for good opportunities for Saturn and Jupiter and this is the best I've been able to muster with Saturn.\r\n\r\nI have begun working with strings of imaging runs and Winjupos.  I can see the wonderful benefits of doing it this way, just need to keep working on learning the Winjupos software.  \r\n\r\nThis one might have been really nice if I had done 15 or 20 consecutive runs and de-rotated and combined with Winjupos.  I think the seeing was really good on this night and even though I missed the opportunity, I am pleased with the incremental progress.  \r\n\r\nTossed a Jupiter in here as well...  Noisy, but like the Saturn image an improvement nonetheless...\r\n\r\nComments/criticism always welcome and CS!",
