    "description": "Jupiter with Ganymede's shadow on Thu 1 Aug 2019 UTC.\r\n\r\nFirst WinJUPOS composite combining nine stacks between 7:18 and 7:30 pm AEST. Commenced imaging the GRS region shortly before sunset but the seeing remained soft for the first couple of hours. Perseverance finally paid off with conditions improving significantly as the evening wore on.\r\n\r\nA complex turbulent area within the SEB ahead of the storm is on view, while the GRS 'chimney' is fully closed.",
