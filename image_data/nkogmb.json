    "description": "As implied by the title, I hope that this presentation of the Cocoon might fancifully suggest a colourful autumn leaf that has floated along a stream and been momentarily trapped by silt. The stars crowding the corners might then give the impression of multicoloured gems having also been carried there by the current. ðŸ¤“\r\n\r\nThis is the sixth image that I've completed using my \"Final Frontier Telescope\", which was installed at the Sierra Remote Observatories (SRO) at the end of June. My system includes a PlaneWave CDK 24\" on a PlaneWave single-fork L600, an FLI Kepler 4040 camera, and Chroma Technology filters.\r\n\r\nThis is the result of just under 12 hours of subframes (300 minutes luminance and 400 minutes RGB), captured on three nights in late August and one night in mid-October. To optimize the final appearance, I downsampled the full-scale image by 75%, with a final plate scale of about 0.62\"/pixel, and an angular image size after cropping of about 31' x 30'.",
