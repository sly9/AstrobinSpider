    "description": "I joined a team of around 15 folks who remotely use the Deep Sky West-Chile's TOA-150/FLI ML16200 scope/camera.  This is the first set of data that I threw together to see what it's like to process fantastic quality data from a REALLY dark site.....I was VERY pleased!  I know it's \"cheating\" to not physically take the data myself but I'll NEVER get my scopes into the Southern Hemisphere...let alone the Atacama Desert....and there's some really fantastic objects to enjoy South of the Equator.  I've imaged M20 with my equipment but it's hard here in Indiana cause it's low and I've only got about a 2 1/2 hour window before it goes behind the trees.  I thought I'd obtained a couple of fairly good images of M20 but this one blew me away!  I was going to process out some of the star field because it's so dense, but I left it in since I've never been able to obtain that deep an image.  I've got some NB data to add to it but I haven't processed it yet....more to come.\r\nAnyway, hope ya like it!\r\nTom",
