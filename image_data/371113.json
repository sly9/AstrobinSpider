    "description": "NGC 7497, 60 million light years distant, appears behind this interstellar dust less than a thousand light years distant. This dust is very dimly lit by the combined starlight of our own Milky Way galaxy.\r\n\r\nThis dim starlight reflection was captured at 4,200' with 11.25 hours of luminance and 6 hours of color (RGB) using a 24\" Planewave CDK24.\r\n\r\nDuring the 3 days it took to gather the light shown here, the skies were exceptionally dark (21.4 SQM average) and clear.\r\n\r\nComments are much appreciated!",
