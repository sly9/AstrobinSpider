    "description": "I imaged this target some years ago and was not very satisfied with the bi-colour image I processed at the time.  So I had to improve this time around :-).  I certainly feel this is a better image both from a data capture and processing perspective.  However, I have had little time to acquire data and the weather has been poor again in the UK this summer.  My forecast for the next week is dreadful too so I felt I better process the HaRGB data and remain optimistic for a clear window for SII and OIII data (if possible) in the next week or so.\r\n\r\nThe equipment is destined for a new remote setup in the near future so I do not have an option to persevere . . . and any way I want to switch to my longer FL refractor.\r\n\r\nI've added further RGB data and then re-processed completely for revision D, a slight crop to emphasise the Cave.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking.",
