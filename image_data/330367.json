    "description": "Part of a Leo Triplet Mosaic I'm working on.  My FOV is just too small to get all three in frame with decent composition.  This is fairly tightly cropped - the sensor size is 4096x4096.\r\n\r\nHappy with the detail I'm getting inside the galaxy!  I found that bringing down the highlights before going non-linear and then applying two different scales of un-sharp masking brought the most detail.\r\n\r\n14 total hours L26 R20 G26 B16, all 600 seconds.  A super-luminance was used.",
