    "description": "If I did some cropping I found that I could also add data that I had from October on LDN1171 to the image I recently posted, which put the Iris in the center.\nSo it is now from LDN1171 to NGC7023 and Sh2-136 for those that like proper designationsðŸ˜‰\n\nThe story behind the image is the same: The loss of astro darkness have made me dig a bit deeper in the data I collected this season and try to be creative by mixing data. I discovered that I had a RASA image from August 2020 of these objects to which I could add more RASA data of the Iris from October 2020 and also 5 hours of refractor data of the Ghost and surrounding creatures from 2018. The refractor data was added to about 50%, mainly as lum.",
