    "description": "Frank Costanza (one of the great comedy characters IMO) tells an excruciating and hilarious story about when he was a 18 and he had a \"Sssssiiiilver dollar collection!\". We lost the brilliant Jerry Stiller this year, so let this be my humble tribute to him. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGV4maedjoo\r\n\r\nWell, NGC253 is known most often as the Sculptor Galaxy, but is also known as the Silver Coin or Silver Dollar galaxy. What I love most about this frame is the huge number of teensy little fuzzies - a myriad of more distant galaxies many millions of light years beyond it. My particular favourite collection of these is in the upper right corner of this frame. Also a highlight for me is the IFN, particularly in the lower edge of the frame - there is the urge to darken it out because it resembles some messy light pollution - but I think it's spectacular.\r\n\r\nWas a long project, but well worth the final result.",
