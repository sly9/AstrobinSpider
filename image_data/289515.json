    "description": "Sometimes we get great stretches of weather in Florida and it allows you to go deep in a hurry on an object!  In this case,  I was able to image NGC 3242 or the Ghost of Jupiter, for 8 hours a night for most every night in a 3 week span.  It could take every bit of that data.  I'd love to have gone deeper, but I don't believe it would look significantly better without spending the year on it.  This target has everything from faint background fuzzies, to extended OIII and Ha, concentric shells around the PN, a large faint outer halo, FLIERs, and more.  It was a joy grabbing data across so many filters and watching the target slowly emerge over a few weeks.  As always, thanks for looking and your C&C's are much appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nA great description with many links can be found from Sakib's writeup in a recent EAPOD of the same target  http://eapod.eu/8-november-2016-ghost-of-jupiter-nebula/",
