    "description": "This is a composite of two high resolution panoramas made on June 12, 2018. The foreground exposures were made shortly before sunset when broken clouds created a mottled pattern of sunlight on the mountains. The second series consisted of 12 exposures of the night sky, made two hours later using a tracking mount, which matches the earth's rotation to keep the stars from blurring. A single, high resolution exposure is not possible if a tracking mount is used because it will blur the foreground. Additionally, exposing the landscape at ISO 3200 (which was used for the sky portion) will result in a grainy landscape image that is not satisfactory for anything larger than a computer screen. The final 1.2 GB, 35\" x 65\" composite was rendered from 24 separate exposures.",
