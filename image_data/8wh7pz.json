    "description": "Sh2-308, also designated as Sharpless 308, RCW 11, or LBN 1052, is an H II region located near the center of the constellation Canis Major, composed of ionised hydrogen. It is about 8 degrees south of Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. The nebula is bubble-like (hence its common name, the Cosmic Bubble), surrounding a Wolf–Rayet star named EZ Canis Majoris. This star is in the brief, pre-supernova phase of its stellar evolution. [Wikipedia]\r\n\r\nThis is the first time i attempt to capture this nebula. Its light is mainly OII, but HA frames also revealed some nebular clouds in the field.  It is a very big target, so it is perfect for small refractors.",
