    "description": "This was my choice this year for our trip to Marathon, TX. I am not a big fan of summer targets but wanted to try taking advantage of the lower latitude and go for something low in the southern sky. I've had my eye on this one for a while. I love it as there is a lot of different things going on in the frame. There's 1 NGC, 4 IC, 2 Sharpless, 3 Barnard, and 4 PGC objects. There's also a mixture of Dark, Emission, and Reflection nebulas. Overall I am pretty pleased with how this one turned out. It is fairly bright and didn't require a ton of RGB data. I did have one issue with my rig where for some reson, especially for Lum, the eccentricity of frames captured after the meridian was substantially higher by about +0.1. I haven't quite been able to pinpoint the cause of this yet. It appears to be something in the imaging train and is more noticable with good seeing and lower fwhm. Other than that everything worked great including the Mesu which has been rock solid.",
