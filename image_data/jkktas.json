    "description": "Ok, one more eclipse image.\nI wanted to make use of the several images I got from the different 10 second videos I took with Sharpcap throughout the eclipse.\nSo, this is a composite image consisting of several images taken at different stages of the eclipse through a Skywatcher Esprit 120ED with an ASI294mcPro camera.\nThe second to last moon phase image is a blend of two images taken at around the same eclipse phase but with different exposures done for the bright side and the dark side",
