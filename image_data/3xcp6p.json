    "description": "It should be clear in the night according to the weather forcast of meteoblue on June 18th. I finally got an opportunity to shoot the Jupiter when its GRS, which I kept thinking about, turned to our earth. The altitude of Jupiter was quite low when I prepared to take it, so I chose the Saturn first. But clouds came before finishing. I didn't want to give up because I have taken N photos of the Jupiter when GRS was back to us. But what can I do was only just sitting beside my telescope, waiting clouds dispersed.Fortunately, I got a chance luckily to take it through a break in the clouds, when the GRS was just at the edge of this celestial body.",
