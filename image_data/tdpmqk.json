    "description": "It was supposed to be cloudy last night, but it wasn't, so even though I haven't slept much, I had to do it.\r\n\r\nI didn't care what I took a picture of so long as you haven't taken a picture of it ;) I guess someone has already taken a picture of it, and it is better than mine, but it didn't show up when I searched because it isnt plate solved. https://www.astrobin.com/123455/?nc=user\r\n\r\nThese 2 galaxies are a first (scratch that), I mean a second on Astrobin, and they are very very small in my FOV. I took 1 hour worth of footage and realized I hadn't turned on the cooler! I got some more. \r\n\r\nThis is a pretty fun image to me and I bet one of yall can get a better shot.",
