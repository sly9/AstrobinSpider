    "description": "New image from a week in July in the Sierras:  the galaxy NGC 5907..took me a week of constant imaging through wildfire smoke to get this.  It's in the constellation Draco.\r\n\r\nfrom Wikipedia:\r\n<I>NGC 5907 (also known as Knife Edge Galaxy or Splinter Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy located approximately 50 million light years from Earth. The galaxy was discovered in 1788 by William Herschel. </I>\r\n\r\nIt's a warped spiral galaxy from some previous interaction with another galaxy..there are faint star tidal streams around it..I tried to get these streams with 20 minute exposures but still pretty faint..you can see a bit of one of the streams to the left of the galaxy.",
