    "description": "Original image : starless version\r\nImage D : image processed using starnet++ star mask\r\nImage E : zoom for comparing quality of stars using starnet++ mask vs conventional mask\r\n\r\nImage H and I : are the result of a tentative to \"use again\" the green color - after removing the green global bias in the image - by stretching the \"used palette\" so it will cover the full spectrum again. The green therefore re-appears in distinctive areas (with specific intermediate hue) rather than a global bias in the image. This is a bit experimental for the moment.\r\n\r\nFor long time, I have been unsatisfied with my ability to use star mask efficiently in PI, and to produce stars with little artifacts.\r\nRecently, I  tried starnet++ which is a Neural Network based software developped by Nikita Misiura to produced better (according to my ability) star mask.\r\n\r\nMy process for version D image :\r\n- convert to monochrome the RGB Non Linear version of the image\r\n- apply starnet++ to the image to produce a star mask\r\n- restart processing of the SHO image (non linear) by applying \"a\" & \"b\" color channels of the RGB image and the \"L\" channel of the SHO image to the SHO image under the star-mask.\r\n- continue the process as usual ....\r\n\r\nMy findings :\r\n- the star mask is easy to produce since there is no trial and error to include both bright and tiny stars, and to adjust the size of the stars in the mask.\r\n- computation time is OK : few minutes in monochrome 16 Mpixels image.\r\n- I found the result better than what I was (personaly) able to achieve with conventional masking.\r\n\r\nStarnet++ is primarily intended to produce starless image. I have attached a version of this ... even if I like star field !",
