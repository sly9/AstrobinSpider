    "description": "This is my first attempt at not binning the color.  I think from here on out, I will go un-binned!  I think it produces a better result and allows me to degrade the resolution of the image for color if I want to.  The color in the image is a bit noisy, but I am going back for more data.  I find that my Moravian has a ratio of somewhere around 1R 1.3G 2.3B.  I am interested in knowing what others are experiencing.\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas!",
