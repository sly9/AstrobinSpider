    "description": "After two years I decided to remaster my previous poster :)\r\nI added five new objects nad many of them are processed again.\r\nAlso stars backgroung was replaced - I made it using stars from Cheeseburger Nebula photo - starfield is randomized :) There is no real configuration there.\r\n\r\nAll of the photographs were made using lucky-imaging / short-exposure technique with exp times from 1s to 20 seconds (without guiding)\r\nThat's why details in all of the nebulas is really nice.\r\nResolution of photo is 0,55'/pix\r\n\r\nData collected using 350/1400 and 250/1200 Newtonian telescopes with ASI 178 MM-C camera on NEQ-6 mount\r\n\r\nFull 41 MPix resolution (with scale 0,23''/pix)  poster is avaiable for printout here:\r\n\r\nhttps://pixels.com/featured/hearts-of-dying-stars-lukasz-sujka.html",
