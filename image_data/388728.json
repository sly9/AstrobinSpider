    "description": "This is an example of a typical evolved planetary nebula.  In other words, aging.   It lacks the obvious shell morphology often seen in a younger versions of planetary nebula.  This large beautiful planetary nebula can be found in the constellation Fornax.  Its common name, “The Robin’s Egg Nebula” describes the object perfectly.\r\n\r\nReddish jet like glows located along the longer axis are believed to have been ejected from the original star before its final collapse.  In time, entropy will cause everything to fade.  Eventually, only the white dwarf in the centre will remain.  It will take several billion years to finally cool off.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to show as many details and features that I could with this data set.  Accentuating depth and contrast areas within this very distinctive object.\r\n\r\nThe image was constructed using five filters, Luminance, Red, Green, Blue, and Hydrogen-Alpha (Ha).   The total imaging time is 65.75 hours.\r\n\r\nExposure Details:\r\nLum 75X900\r\nRed 35X450\r\nGreen 36X450\r\nBlue 49X450\r\nHa 32X1800\r\nTotal time 65.75 hours\r\n\r\nInstruments Used:\r\n10 Inch RCOS fl 9.1\r\nAstro Physics AP-900 Mount\r\nSBIG STL 11000m\r\nFLI Filter Wheel\r\nAstrodon Lum, Red, Green, Blue Filters\r\nBaader Planetarium H-alpha 7nm Narrowband-Filter\r\n\r\nSoftware Used\r\nCCDStack (calibration, alignment, data rejection, stacking)\r\nPhotoshop CS 6 (Image processing)\r\n\r\nThanks for looking",
