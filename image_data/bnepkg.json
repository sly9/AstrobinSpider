    "description": "I've been wanting to try this one for a long time. It's a very hard target to image from my location, never getting above 24 degrees elevation. I had about 3 hours per night starting at 19 degrees which took about 6 weeks from mid October to late Novemver. I was also shooting through the light dome of nearby Chico. Because of this, it's imaged in narrowband with Ha and OIII.",
