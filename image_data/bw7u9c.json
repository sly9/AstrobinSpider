    "description": "The Snake Nebula. Generally a target I would avoid. Not the biggest fan of it. In fact, I think I have data on it sitting around else where from a different scope. However, my friends Tim and Casey recently uploaded an image using the same data. I liked them so much I decided to give it a go as well. Fairly happy with the results, even though there really isn't much to edit with targets like this. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
