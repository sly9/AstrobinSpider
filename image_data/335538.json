    "description": "This is my first attempt on collecting Ha. What else to do when I suddenly had a clear night after a month of clouds but also a bright moon. This is a 300 mm telephoto lens image (34 x 8 min) to which I added data (18 x 15 min) centrally from a 5\" refractor sitting side by side. Both acquired with Canon 60D cameras (60Da for the refractor) at ISO1600. Astronomik 12 nm Ha clip in for the telephoto lens and a Baader 7nm Ha filter for the refractor. Stacked in PI and processed in PS.\r\n-15Â°C in the air must have helped keeping noise down (but made touching the gear quite painful)",
