    "description": "Even with over 100 hours of integration time, I still had a major challenge processing this data at f/7. In addition, even though I used narrowband filters, these fainter objects still get affected by my heavy light pollution. I had to push it really hard to get the detail I wanted out of it. Subsequently I had a lot of processing artifacts to clean up as well. This is the first time I have done over 100 hours of integration time and the first time I did all that within the same season of the same year. We were fortunate to have a lot of clear nights recently, which is the first time for me this time of year here in Michigan since I started astrophotography in 2016.\r\n\r\nSh2-224 is a very faint supernova remnant located approximately 14,700 lightyears distant in the constellation Auriga.  This unusual celestial object is also designated VRO 42.05.01. The nebula created by the supernova explosion is composed of two visual parts.  It is postulated the supernova explosion created a bubble like structure, visible in the top of the image.  As the shockwave from the explosion progressed into a very low density region of the interstellar medium, a \"wing\" component was expelled, visible in the bottom of the image.\r\n\r\nSupernova explosions are the end stage of the natural life cycle of very large stars.  Such events are responsible for the distribution of heavy elements into the interstellar medium where they are incorporated in the birth of new star systems.  Without this phenomenon, planets, such as the Earth along with life as we know it, would not be possible.",
