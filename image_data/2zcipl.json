    "description": "Kronberger 6`1 (Kn 61). also known as the Soccer Ball nebula, is a recently-discovered planetary nebula in the constellation of Cygnus. It was discovered in January 2011 by Mattias Kronberger, who is a member of the amateur group Deep Sky Hunters. It is very small (diameter of 104 arcsecs).\r\nIt is barely visible on the second Palomar Optical Sky Survey (POSS-II) blue plate scan, suggesting a surface brightness well below magnitude 25 per square arcsecond - and at an estimated distance of 13,000 light years (1).\r\nIt is a highly filamentary bubble with a high expansion velocity of 67.6 km/second. A crude kinematic age for the bubble yields 16,000 years (2).\r\n\r\n(1) http://www.gemini.edu/node/11656\r\n(2) https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4408",
