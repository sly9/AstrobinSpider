    "description": "Surrounding the extremely popular Iris Nebula is a vast and beautiful field of dust.  My favorite region of the sky for imaging is in and around Cepheus.  There is just so much to find here at any focal length. \r\n\r\nThis area of dust not far from the Iris Nebula has been on my list for some time.  Now that I have a very fast widefield setup and have had the fortune of five clear nights in a row I dedicated almost 14 hours of sky time to it.  \r\n\r\nI am still learning how to bring out dusty targets.  I struggle with achieving that 3D effect that really experienced imagers are able to pull off.  Hoping I did it justice and will definitely revisit this data as my experience grows!\r\n\r\nC&C welcome.",
