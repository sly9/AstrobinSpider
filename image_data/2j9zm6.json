    "description": "I find these tiny planetary nebula a challenge, but I love a good challenge! Whenever I am working with something this small, I drizzle the data in PixInsight prior to post processing in PixInsight and Photoshop. \n\nIt's located 11,500 light years away in the constellation of Hercules at a declination of +41 degrees. This 13th magnitude PN spans about 40 arc-seconds in our apparent view, which corresponds to an actual diameter of just over 2 light years.",
