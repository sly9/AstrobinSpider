    "description": "This was a more challenging target than I thought it would be.  I hope to have another clear night soon so I can try to add some Ha data to bring out the emission nebula within the galaxy arms.  I also think that it is faint enough that despite imaging at f2.8, I could easily double or triple the lum channel.  The details here are tough to bring out with such a heavy crop, but I think more time would help that. \r\n\r\nC&C Welcome.  ",
