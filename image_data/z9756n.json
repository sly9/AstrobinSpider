    "description": "An absolute mind bendingly test of patience this mosaic was. Took me countless hours to get them to stitch properly. I tried all various forms of combination using different DBEs, Linear Fits, color corrections, etc., only to end up with weird gradients from Rigel all over the place. Finally nailed it on one combination and immediately saved it and stopped messing with it so I didn't lose it. \r\n\r\nReally happy with this came out after the initial speed bump. This target has always been a favorite of mine, but shooting it with the 135mm left a little to be desired in terms of resolving power along with the super dense star field hiding a lot of cool nebulosity. I did try to blend some of the red frames taken from the 135mm though to give a pseudo Ha frame look since we didn't shoot any Ha and I just love the surrounding red. Sadly it lacks some detail and it was a pain to get it to blend correctly, but I would much rather it there than have it gone.  While maybe a slightly wider FOV would have been nice, I am still mega stoked with this image and definitely wouldn't want to try to add anymore to the mosaic. \r\n\r\nClear skies y'all",
