    "description": "A reprocess of my southern Winter Milky Way image using Microsoft ICE for the panoramic stitching. This has provided the opportunity to leave it in its full stereographic projection format without fiddling with the horizon to try and make it level. The benefit is that we can now include more of the original data including Jupiter at the top of the image. \r\n\r\nThere are three planets now in this image. Can you see them all?\r\n\r\nImage is a 3 x 8 panel mosaic captured with a Canon 60Da and Samyang 14m F2.8 lens mounted on a tripod. Each panel was 20 seconds @ ISO3200.",
