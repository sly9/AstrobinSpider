    "description": "The object shown in this new picture, CG4, also sometimes referred as God’s Hand, is one of these cometary globules. It is located about 1300 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Puppis.\r\n\r\nThe head of CG4, which is the part visible on this image and resembles the head of the gigantic beast, has a diameter of 1.5 light-years. The tail of the globule — which extends downwards and is not visible in the image — is about eight light-years long. By astronomical standards this makes it a comparatively small cloud.\r\n\r\nThe relatively small size is a general feature of cometary globules. All of the cometary globules found so far are isolated, relatively small clouds of neutral gas and dust within the Milky Way, which are surrounded by hot ionised material.\r\n\r\nThe head part of CG4 is a thick cloud of gas and dust, which is only visible because it is illuminated by the light from nearby stars. The radiation emitted by these stars is gradually destroying the head of the globule and eroding away the tiny particles that scatter the starlight. However, the dusty cloud of CG4 still contains enough gas to make several Sun-sized stars and indeed, CG4 is actively forming new stars, perhaps triggered as radiation from the stars powering the Gum Nebula reached CG4.\r\n\r\nWhy CG4 and other cometary globules have their distinct form is still a matter of debate among astronomers and two theories have developed. Cometary globules, and therefore also CG4, could originally have been spherical nebulae, which were disrupted and acquired their new, unusual form because of the effects of a nearby supernova explosion. Other astronomers suggest, that cometary globules are shaped by stellar winds and ionising radiation from hot, massive OB stars. These effects could first lead to the bizarrely (but appropriately!) named formations known as elephant trunks and then eventually cometary globules.\r\nSource: eso.org\r\n\r\ninstead of God’s Hand, I personally think it looks like a were-worm (from The Hobbit) about to swallow a galaxy :)\r\n\r\nThis picture is a composite between data acquired by two telescopes in 2018 & 2021:\r\n- Riccardi Honders 305mm f3.8 for the wide field\r\n- Planewave 17“ CDK @ F6.8 for the high res of CG 4\r\n\r\nRA: 07h 34m 22.7s\r\nDEC: -46° 54’ 06.7“\r\nSize: 70 x 48.8 arcmin\r\nOrientation: Up is 0.6 degrees E of N\r\nLocation: Puppis\r\nDistance: 1.3 kly\r\n\r\nAcquisition December 2018 & February 2021\r\nTotal acquisition time of 38.3 hours.\r\n\r\nTechnical Details\r\nData acquisition: <a href=\"https://www.martinpughastrophotography.space/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Martin PUGH</a>\r\nProcessing: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nicolasrollandastro/\">Nicolas ROLLAND</a>\r\n\r\nTelescope 1 (17.3 hours): \r\nLocation: Heaven's Mirror Observatory, Australia \r\nL 8 x 1200 sec\r\nR 9 x 1200 sec\r\nG 9 x 1200 sec\r\nB 8 x 1200 sec\r\nHa 12 x 1800 sec\r\nOptics: Riccardi Honders 305mm f3.8\r\nMount: Paramount ME II\r\nCCD: SBIG STXL-16200\r\n\r\nTelescope 2 (21 hours):\r\nLocation: El Sauce Observatory, Rio Hurtado, Chile \r\nL 27 x 1200 sec\r\nR 12 x 1200 sec\r\nG 12 x 1200 sec\r\nB 12 x 1200 sec\r\nOptics: Planewave 17“ CDK @ F6.8\r\nMount: Paramount ME\r\nCCD: SBIG STXL-11002 (AOX)\r\n\r\nPre Processing: CCDstack & Pixinsight\r\nPost Processing: Photoshop CC",
