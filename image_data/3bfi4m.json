    "description": "Hello Friends,\r\n\r\nas promised, I have created a small animation of the prom. But I have to admit this was a hack of a work. A lot of manual adjustment in PS and hundred of tries in PiPP. But I also learned a lot and that is the fun about.\r\n\r\nThis animation is the 5% outcome of 36 videos consisting out of 5000 frames each. \r\n\r\nPlease enjoy!",
