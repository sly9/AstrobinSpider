    "description": "Here's my attempt at good ol' M13. Really like how my scope held the focus during the night. Also the \"Star Shape\" setting as weighting for the subs in AstropixelProcessor helped a lot to get the smallest and nicest stars out of the stack. Quite pleased with how this one turned out. Also only a minimum of post processing was needed.\r\n\r\nAgain in my featured series \"how it all begun\" I hereby present you my last version of M13 from last year: <a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/299169/B/?image_list_page=3&nc=&nce=\">M13 Single Shot</a>",
