    "description": "Images from the following two scopes (piggybacked) contributed to this image:\r\nAG12+ASI1600MM at .70 asec/pix (L)\r\nTV127is+ASI183MM at .75 asec/pix. (RGB)\r\nThey were all registered to the best L image taken on the AG12.\r\n\r\nThe Tadpole Galaxy (or Arp 188) is currently suffering a strong interaction with another galaxy. Tidal forces have created a 280,000 light years long tail with massive star formations: there are many bright star clusters containing a huge quantity of young and hot blue stars. The galaxy is 420 million light years away from us in the constellation Draco.  This is a really LONG way from our Milky Way Galaxy.  For reference, the Local Group of galaxies that the Milky Way is part of is (only) 10 million light years across.   The intruder galaxy is estimated to be located about 300 000 light years behind Arp 188.  Part of the beauty of this image is the many background galaxies that you can discover on the full size version of this image.   (sun.org)",
