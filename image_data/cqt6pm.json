    "description": "The great bubble in Canis Major, Sh2-308 is also known as the Dolphin nebula.  It's a very popular target for imagers in southern locations as it lies in the southern sky.  Sh2-308 is mainly made up of doubly ionized oxygen (OIII) with a bit of hydrogen alpha (HII) mixed in.   It was produced by strong stellar winds from the Wolf-Rayet star HD 50896, near center, which blew stellar material into the shape you see.   HD 50896 is 20 times the mass of our sun.  Sh2-308 lies 5200 light years distant and is 60 light year in diameter.  This object is very low for me so I only had about 2hrs per session to gather data.  I started in Nov 2020 and finished up a week ago in March 2021.  The image is a HOO image with RGB stars added.  9hrs of Ha, 9hrs 40min of OIII and 125min each RGB channel.  The image is a crop of a larger FOV.",
