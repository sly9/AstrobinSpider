    "description": "I did M106 before with a more narrow field.  This time I wanted to get some of the surrounding galaxies in the frame so I used the Optec .5 corrector/reducer.   I was a bit surprised to see one of the Ha jets pop out in spite of having no Ha subs.  I also didn't use as much noise reduction so not to wipe out some of the background galaxies.  30x300s, 14x200s RGB 2x2 binned.",
