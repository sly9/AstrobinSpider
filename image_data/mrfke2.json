    "description": "The challenge of NGC 2359 is not about the O-III - the O-III signal is surprisingly strong. The hard part is the background H-II regions. I am still not sure if I captured enough. Well, there were many chances when the moon was out and bright.  :-)\r\n\r\nStill, I should've captured the S-II channel. But I didn't. During the processing, it's obvious that one color layer is missing - the \"golden touch\" of the bright edges. \r\n\r\nDeconvolution had an obvious boost on both Ha and O-III masters. I did a test drive on Topaz DeNoise AI to see how much more detail enhancement could be done. Possibly the deconvolution did most of the job already, or I just don't like the artifacts introduced by Topaz DeNoise AI's algorithm, I stayed with the result from the deconvolution.  \r\n\r\nMaybe there is still time for the S-II channel. Maybe at the end of the year.\r\n\r\n<B><I><u>Update:</u></I></B>\r\n\r\nThe little ball shape object at the lower-left corner is a PN. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=PN%20G227.1%2B00.5\"><B>PHR J0719-1222</B> -- Planetary Nebula</a>\r\n\r\n<B><I><u>Update:</u></I></B>\r\n\r\nAdded 3.83 hours of S-II to the blend. Can't wait for the winter of 2021! :-)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/search/?q=TeamNoctuaDSNM&subject=&telescope=&camera=&date_published_min=2011-11-09&date_published_max=2099-05-10\"><I>#TeamNoctuaDSNM</I></a>",
