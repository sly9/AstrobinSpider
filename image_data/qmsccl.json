    "description": "Personally, not the biggest fan of globular clusters. Normally when they are shot here, I either download them and let them sit untouched, or I don't even sync them to save folder space. This one is only slightly different due to being one of the biggest and brightest ones to exist so I figured I would give it a go. \r\n\r\nWhile I don't find myself overly thrilled with the image, I think I did it justice. Don't expect to be seeing any more globs for a while though. I know I may get bored during lockdown, but hopefully not that bored ;) \r\n\r\nThanks for looking\r\n\r\nSide note - not sure what happened to my saved filters. They used to be labeled FLI's, now they're just red, green, and blue. Sorry, no idea.",
