    "description": "September and October clear nights in Coonabarabran have enabled additions to my Eridanus Loop project. Here now are 35 mosaic tiles of the large superbubble of gas that surrounds the Orion/Eridanus region. 35 tiles. 10 x 1800s exposure per tile with the Tak FSQ f/5 astrograph. 5nm bandpass Hydrogen alpha emission line. Professional description: The Orion-Eridanus superbubble is a large, elongated (20 degree x 45 degree) cavity in the interstellar medium, filled with hot plasma, that has been created by the nearest active high mass star forming region to the Sun, the Orion star forming region. The superbubble is unusual in that it is oriented roughly parallel to the Galactic plane, is highly elongated, and contains bright filamentary features at large distances from the Orion star forming region.
