    "description": "M100 is a smallish Messier Galaxy, 7.5' at its widest.  But it makes up for its size with a delicate spiral morphology.  The most interesting detail is a very bright blue inner ring where stars are being birthed in large numbers.  This ring required combining a separate, more limited stretch to prevent it saturating.   \r\n\r\nThis galaxy and its companions, NGC4328 and NGC 4323, are a part of the Virgo cluster.  Zooming in, it would seem that half of the objects in the FOV are stars and half are galaxies.  \r\n\r\nI like to imagine this galaxy and M31 switching places.  What a beautiful sight that would make using binoculars.",
