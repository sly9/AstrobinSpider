    "description": "Image data acquired on shared hardware between Dhaval Bhrambhatt and Myself in Marathon Texas.\r\n\r\nLove this target and have tried to get the \"variability\" to show up with a group of other images few years back. Didn't really see much I think. But I would like to keep shooting it and see if I can build a video showing the changes.\r\n\r\nData was acquired on few really nice nights but then high level clouds dropped SNR and dew started to cause issues as well (in spite of the heat band). I am not happy with the stars, but Overall, I think for this hardware,  this probably is expected.",
