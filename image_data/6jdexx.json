    "description": "Mars 10 hours post Opposition.\r\n\r\nMore challenging conditions tonight with JS at 40 kts. Made 14 RGB runs with this being the best interval. Could only image for one hour before thicker clouds arrived from the east. Was worried about precipitation so decided to call it a night around 11:30pm.\r\n\r\nSinus Sabaeus is on view here with Valles Marineris rising over the western limb. Pretty happy with ADC in the train as it helps to bring out subtle colour differentiation between terrain albedo markings.",
