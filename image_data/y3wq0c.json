    "description": "The unmistakable Jellyfish nebula. A longtime favorite of mine, I missed this last year because i was working on a mosaic. I almost missed it this year because of self-inflicted equipment shuffles. I wanted to shoot this wide-field but, because of the aforementioned shuffle, had to settle on the 12.5\" iDK. I'm glad I did, because the detail that the scope produced is excellent.\r\n\r\nThis was also first light with the PL16803. The data was really nice to work with in terms of noise reduction and sharpening. The bright star Eta Geminorum (Propus) was a bit challenging both during acquisition and processing. I had to deal with pretty serious reflections in the form of a large halo and some microlens artifacts. A drawback to the large-ish aperture of the telescope and the long exposures needed to grab the faint detail. I learned a few new tricks and, while not perfect, the result is pleasing to my eye.",
