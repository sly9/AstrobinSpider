    "description": "M83\r\nI can say without a doubt, that m83 is one of most beautiful DSOs in the nightsky, and maybe my favourite. Since its barely visible from where I live, I haven't tried to shoot it, but thanks to @mattdieterich and @observatorioelsauce and @planewaveinstruments it became possible for me to have an incredible image of it in my gallery.\r\n\r\nTaken with:\r\nPlaneWave CDK600 (CDK24)\r\nL-600 mount\r\nFLI Proline 16803\r\n\r\nExposure:\r\nH-alpha = 27 x 20 min subs\r\nL = 20 x 10 min subs\r\nRGB = 6 x 10 min subs per channel\r\nTotal exposure: 15.3 hours\r\nCalibrated and processed in PixInsight.",
