    "description": "I think I discovered a new law of nature: when you install the tripod and the telescope there are no clouds in the sky. When you start filming the moon for your mosaics, the clouds will appear : ) This is a 6 panel mosaic including one of my favorite craters, Gassendi. We can see that the area is flanked by the rays coming from Tycho on the left and Copernicus on the lower part. \r\n\r\nPitatus is on the left, Bullialdus in the middle of the picture and Gassendi on the upper right. I'll try to post an annotated version. And then hope that the clouds will be gone after the Full Moon so I can find the other group of friends including M106 : )",
