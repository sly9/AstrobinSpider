    "description": "I finally made it to Milky Way season! \r\n\r\nWolf-Rayet nebulae are formed when the atmosphere of a star is shed during the red supergiant phase and subsequently shocked by the fast Wolf-Rayet winds forming a kind of bubble nebula. Some of my favorite nebulae belong to this category, including Thor's Helmet and the Crescent Nebula.\r\n\r\nWR134 will probably be my last image for a while as I think I've only had one or two truly clear nights since I my last night on this. I could really use a clear night - I haven't had a chance to see C/2020 F3 Neowise yet!\r\n\r\nEdit: Named <a href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/zwoasiusers/permalink/1176641279361585/>image of the week</a> by ZWO for week 32 of 2020.",
