    "description": "The Bubble Nebula is an emission nebula situated at 7100 - 11000 ly in Cassiopeia. It has a diameter of 10 ly and it is created by the stellar wind caused by the star  SAO 20575 (BD+60 2522). (Wikipedia).\r\n\r\nIt is an image created using the N, Ha and O3 filters. The N filter is using a 658 nm wavelength  vs 656 nm for Ha. I find it interesting that the N signal won't be available when using the 3nm Astrodon filters (the 7nm Zwo filters includes the N signal in Ha for example). Could it be worth using the Zwo filter instead of the Astrodon filter when imaging the Bubble nebula from backyard? Astrodon manufactures N2 filters too, but haven't seen yet an amateur image produced using the N2 filter.\r\n\r\nCredit: NASA/ESA/Hubble\r\nProcessing: Bogdan Borz 2020\r\n\r\nPixinsight, Photoshop",
