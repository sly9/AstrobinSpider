    "description": "1/1.8\" sensor did not allow full capture of the outer NGC 1291 ring, however it gave a close up of the inner core. I've tried to keep this image as close to the raw data as possible - post processing mainly to lower excessive LP, optical aberrations, and thermal noise from non-cooled OSC (or should it be uncooled? Bit of a negative undertone to it...I digress).",
