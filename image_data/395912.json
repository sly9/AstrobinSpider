    "description": "This years Winter Star Party (2019) was one of the best I’ve seen in 15 years weather wise. We had clear skies a good portion of every night, and I managed to capture close to 7 hours of data on this target over the course of four evenings using my favorite imaging combination, my Sky-Watcher Esprit 150 refractor and an FLI MicroLine 16200. I have a MoonLite NiteCrawler focuser/rotator upgrade for the OTA as well, and it’s just a rock solid and reliable combination.  I only shoot RGB and no Luminance, as this is becoming my norm for most objects to just collect more RGB rather than use Luminance. I'm finding most of the time I just don't need it except for the very faintest of details.",
