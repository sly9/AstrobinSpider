    "description": "Another one that was collected back in Oct & Nov that I finally got around to processing. Near the center is NGC1893, a young (~4Myo) open star cluster of hot, massive stars. The cluster was formed from the distinctly shaped gas and dust clouds to the SW, known as the Tadpoles. The Tadpoles are about 10 light years in length and are likely still active star formation regions.",
