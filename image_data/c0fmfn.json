    "description": "NGC 134 is a barred spiral galaxy located 60 million light years from here that is thought to resemble our own galaxy The Milky Way. The galaxyâ€™s spiral arms are loosely wrapped around a bright, bar-shaped central region. The nature of the spiral arms categorize this galaxy as a Hubble type Sbc A prominent feature of NGC 134 is its warped disc. There is a trail of gas that has been stripped from the top edge of the disc and a faint gas jet at the bottom. This indicates possible interaction with another galaxy, but to date that is speculative.\nImaged in LRGB at Obstech, El Sauce, Chile\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\nSystem Control: Voyager by Leo Orazi",
