    "description": "After several months of rain and cloudy nights I finally managed to take this fourth attempt of NGC 1365 Barred spiral galaxy located in the Fornax constellation. Located 56 million light years away it is twice the size of our  own galaxy with roughly the same mass. At the core there is a super massive black hole spinning at 84% the speed of light. Appx 2 million miles across, that is the fastest RPM I have ever heard of !!\r\n\r\nEvery little smudge in this image or fuzzy patch is actually a galaxy much further away ! , This is as far as my telescope can go.",
