    "description": "Abell 61 is a  faint planetary nebula, a kind of twin of Abell39. It is however much more difficult to image than Abell39. I unfortunately gave it a try with a 85 mm refractor with half Moon shining and some veils in the sky, to get it even worse in a season where the object is not really at the zenith...So my conclusion is \"Don't try this at home\" ;-))\r\nNow as you learnt what NOT to do for capturing it, maybe some of you would like to add it at their target list. Good luck.\r\nCapture during two nights. 11x720 s Ha, 16x720s OIII",
