    "description": "Found among the rich star fields of the Milky Way toward the constellation Cassiopeia, star cluster NGC 7789 lies about 8,000 light-years away. A late 18th century deep sky discovery of astronomer Caroline Lucretia Herschel, the cluster is also known as Caroline's Rose. Its suggestive appearance is created by the cluster's nestled complex of stars and voids. Now estimated to be 1.6 billion years young, the galactic or open cluster of stars also shows its age. All the stars in the cluster were likely born at the same time, but the brighter and more massive ones have more rapidly exhausted the hydrogen fuel in their cores. These have evolved from main sequence stars like the Sun into the many red giant stars shown with a yellowish cast in this lovely color composite.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe data was captured using SGP Pro ( which i am still learning to use )\r\n\r\n \r\nDate 19/08/2017\r\n\r\nLocation: London UK\r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi 130\r\n\r\nMount: Ioptron CEM60\r\n\r\nCCD: QSI 690\r\n\r\nLum: 7 x 300 seconds\r\n\r\nRed: 7 x 300 seconds\r\n\r\nGreen:7 x 300 seconds\r\n\r\nBlue 7 x 300 seconds",
