    "description": "I have been trying to develop a processing workflow that will deal more effectively with the really noisy images produced by my unmodified Nikon D5500. This week I finally got something that seems to work fairly well. I'm also fairly happy with the star management of this workflow.\r\n\r\nThe basic principle is to separate the image into R G and B files, plus create an extracted Luminance file,  and then do the noise reduction and star reduction on each of the 4 separate files, and then recombine them and do the rest of the processing. I decided on this method when I discovered how incredibly noisy the red channel image was compared to the green... I was shocked!",
