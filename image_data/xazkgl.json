    "description": "Previously, I captured this object with my ED80 using mosaic technique (https://astrob.in/x4u8f0/0/). This time I decided to close my gestalt to capture SH2-240 in color using widefield setup. I managed to shoot only a third of the planned time in oxygen. The weather didn't cooperate at winter season with moonless nights. But this didn't stop me from processing this image as HOO. C&C are always welcome.\r\n\r\nSimeis 147, also known as the Spaghetti Nebula, SNR G180.0-01.7 or Sharpless 2-240, is a supernova remnant (SNR) in the Milky Way, straddling the border between the constellations Auriga and Taurus. Discovered in 1952 at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory using a 25-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, it is difficult to observe due to its extremely low brightness.\r\n\r\nThe nebulous area is fairly large with an almost spherical shell and filamentary structure. The remnant has an apparent diameter of approximately 3 degrees, an estimated distance of approximately 3000 (Â±350) light-years, and an age of approximately 40,000 years.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that after its stellar explosion a rapidly spinning neutron star known as pulsar PSR J0538+2817 was left behind in the nebula core, emitting a strong radio signal.\r\n(c) Wikipedia",
