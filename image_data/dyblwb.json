    "description": "You're just too good to be true\r\nCan't take my eyes off of you\r\n.....\r\n\r\nThat is what I was singing when I was capturing Copernicus with superb seeing (after having captured several from the south pole, that hopefully I will be posting soon). \r\n\r\nI had already captured copernicus with ok seeing, but I want it with that superb seeing, and the lighting was good for that part. As usual lately, I arranged for a 5 panel mosaic, one tile centred on copernicus and the other 4 centred on the corners of the first one, in order to maximize the use of the center part of the mirror.  All but the Erathosthenes turned out wonderful. This one was ok, but not as good as the others (if you zoom in it shows in the noise), while the others are so noise free. \r\n\r\nNevertheless I am very happy with this image (and somehow proud, although it is all credited to seeing, the data was so good I hardly did much). \r\n\r\nOn the technical side, it is 3% selection of about 40000 frames at 140 fps. Results processed with lightroom, astra image (for Erathosthenes area) and pixinsight. Details are explained in the side version (workflow chart).\r\n\r\nTake care you all! Guillermo",
