    "description": "Abell 31 is an ancient planetary nebula in the constellation of Cancer.  It’s estimated to be about 2,000 light years away, and very large for a planetary nebula; almost as large as the better known helix nebula.  Although large, it is extremely faint, requiring long exposure to capture.  It also has a an interesting ‘X’ structure in the middle of it.",
