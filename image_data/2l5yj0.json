    "description": "Cederblad 214, also designated Sharpless 171 is an emission nebula imaged under high levels of  light pollution (Bortle 6.2) in the Washington DC suburbs.  Image consists of 39 x 5 minute narrowband Ha, OIII & SII subframes, with dark, bias and flat frames subtracted.\r\n\r\nPixinsight, linear processing: Mure denoise, background extraction & deconvolution.  Each channel stretched separately, using masked stretch for OIII & SII with curves transforms to bring out highlights and suppress background.\r\n\r\nNon-linear processing involved TGV denoise, curves transform, saturation adjustment and multistage median transformation",
