    "description": "This is part 1 of a bigger mosaic that iâ€™m planning to shoot. It shows a small part of the Cygnus nebular complex with the Crescent Nebula at his center.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent Nebula is an emission nebula probably formed by the outer layers of a Wolf-Rayet star found at its center.\r\n\r\nThis is a merge of an HOO image taken with a Canon  photo lens and an HRGB image taken one year ago with a 200/1000 newtonian.",
