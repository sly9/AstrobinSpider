    "description": "In the constellation Cepheus, 2400 light years from Earth, is the Cave Nebula. It is a complex region with a collection of emission, reflection, and dark nebulosity. The crescent-shaped cave is rich in Ha and is a region of active star formation. Also in this image is the VdB155, a soft-blue reflection nebula.\r\n\r\nThis was my most integration-intense project. Over a five-week period I collected more than 50 hours of data, and used just over 38 hours for this image. About half of the data were collected with a WO GT71 (FL 336) and the other half with a WO FLT 132 (FL 925). For the GT71 data, only subs with an HFR ranging 1.5-1.9 were used, and for the FLT132, subs ranging from 2.3-2.9 were used. In the processing of this image, I used the wide angle data for the color mapping and the narrow angle data in the creation of a master luminance mask. This image uses SHO with standard Hubble color assignments and star color provided by RGB data.",
