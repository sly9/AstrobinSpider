    "description": "I had a run on M31 a couple of years ago with my DSRL and my TSA102 and this year i finally got an ASI1600 CMOS camera. So, to keep the same field in my photo, i switched to the FSQ85 and ASI1600 combo. Everything on top of my Losmandy GM8. \r\nI had three nights to gather all the required data. I shot L the first night, and had to shoot shorter frames the next day to keep the core from burning. I also shot H-alpha the second night. The third night was RGB night. In total, 8.6 hrs of integration time in 21.8-21.9 skies, shot in the romanian mountains",
