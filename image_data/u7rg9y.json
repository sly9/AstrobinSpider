    "description": "Taken at around 21:30 BST.  The altitude of the Moon at this point was only 21.5 degrees, which shows it is always worth having a go near sunset when a decent high-pressure area exists.  Not the best, but some decent detail considering the altitude.  Gives me a bit of hope for Jupiter and Saturn this summer!",
