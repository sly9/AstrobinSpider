    "description": "The Jellyfish Nebula, IC 443, is a supernova remnant in the constellation Gemini and lies some 5000 light years away.  Covering an angular diameter of almost 2x the full moon, the remnant is roughly 70 light years across at that distance.  The parent star is thought to have gone supernova 3000 - 30000 years ago.   This has historically been a very active region in the sky as another partial SNR shell can be found to the left of the Jellyfish.  This is  associated with an even older supernova remnant G189.6+3.3 and is dated to around 100000 years old.\r\n\r\nTo the left lie LDN 1568 a dark nebula, LBN 189.33+04.40, a reflection nebula and LBN 188.69+04.25, an HII region.  I think it's cool that from our vantage in the vicinity of two stellar deaths, we see a region of active star formation.",
