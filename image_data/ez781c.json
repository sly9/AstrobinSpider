    "description": "I was inspired by Eric Coles for that picture. I just love his version.\nAnd finally I fixed my star problem. The GPU coma corrector was the issue with my strange looking stars. Now I have a new one and every thing is ok. The rest ist guiding. That can be fixed much easyer.\nHope you enjoy,\n\nCS\n\nChristian",
