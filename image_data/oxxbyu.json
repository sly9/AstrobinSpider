    "description": "This is the big, bright, and beautiful Carina nebula. A star-forming region around 8,500 LY away. \r\n\r\nFor this image, I also took a high-resolution lucky imaging photo of the star Eta Carina to properly expose the surrounding Homunculus nebula.\r\n\r\nThis is a Hubble-palette SHO image, and I have used Eric Coles' multi-scale histogram balancing technique to increase local color contrast. \r\n\r\nHubble's image of the Carina Nebula was one of the first astrophotos that really astonished me and drove me toward astrophotography. It has taken me a long time to get a pleasing image of this wonderful nebula.  \r\n\r\nFor the image of the homunculus, I used my 10\" Skywatcher Go-To Dobsonian and a Powermate, and shot a short SER file, and stacked the best frames, as you would while doing planetary imaging\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
