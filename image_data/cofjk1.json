    "description": "Still Enjoying my 2700mm focal length set up. Just wish the seeing was better. I was trying to get tighter stars for the Trapezium but this was the best I could do this time of the year. Too bad Orion is not in the sky in the summertime when the seeing is good and the living is easy :)\r\nI call this rendering the 'Spectral Palette' where I use narrowband Ha in the red, OIII in the green and Hb in the blue, true to their wavelengths. and blended in the 1 second exposure RGB stars.",
