Only difference here is 5-minute L exposures to help deal with some bright stars and work around moving clouds.\r\n\r\nLost in Space...\r\n\r\n\"...a spiral galaxy NGC 6503 is in a lonely position, at the edge of a strangely empty patch of space called the Local Void. The Local Void is a stretch of space at least 150 million light-years across that seems completely empty of stars or galaxies. Dark dust lanes snake across the galaxy's bright arms and center, giving it a mottled appearance. Bright red patches of gas can be seen scattered through the galaxy's swirling arms, mixed with blue regions that contain newly forming stars.\r\n\r\nAstronomers using Hubble discovered that the emptiness of this region has quite an effect on the space around us â€” the Milky Way is being strongly pulled away from it by the gentle but relentless tug of other nearby galaxies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI do see some other galaxies.
