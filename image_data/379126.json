    "description": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nfinally I managed to get around to capturing the cave nebula. I don't really know why but I think this is an astonishingly looking object in our neighborhood. I deliberately choose a portrait framing here because it gives it a much more dramatic appearance.\r\nI held back releasing this image because I wanted to put it up for a photo contest at the company where I work and premier it there. Now that the contest is over I want to share it with all of you of course - I really enjoy the result I got here. I even exchanged my phones background from my M31 to this :)\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this, take care and clear skies.",
