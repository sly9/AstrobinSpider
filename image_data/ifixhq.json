    "description": "I think this is my best Mars image, courtesy of the excellent seeing on October 1st, just 6 days before closest approach. \r\nIt is North up, although shown tilted over for aesthetic reasons.\r\nThe most prominent feature in this image is the gigantic shield volcano Olympus Mons. Again, the oppositional brightening is clear. To its south, two of the Tharsis shield volcanoes are covered by thick orographic clouds.",
