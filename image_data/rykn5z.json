The infinite variety of forms and the shadow play of light and darkness- of celestial chiaroscuro- is found nowhere else in the sky. And so I visited many more parts of this region, many of which are within this field. \r\n\r\nA colleague within the department of astronomy I work at studies this area for his livelihood. In particular he and his team examine this area in radio wavelengths of light in order to map tracer molecules that tell the tales of star formation in this region. As such, in articles like the one below- it is rare to have a nice widefield visible light image to accompany the article. A handful of years ago, I promised to take a picture of his region of study.... and finally I can give it to him. üôÇ\r\n\r\nhttps://news.arizona.edu/story/ingredients-life-appear-stellar-nurseries-long-stars-are-born\r\n\r\nP.S. In the article above, you can't even click on the old DSS image to enlarge it! üôÅ",
