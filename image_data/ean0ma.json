    "description": "Well, I have spent way too much time at the computer working on processing techniques...LOL.  But to be honest, this is the best I have felt about my processing in years.  I am blending my history with Photoshop with what I can absorb and apply from Pixinsight.  This is a narrow band combination with HaRGB taken from iTelescope data over one year ago.  I am using this as a building block for developing a working process for me for current NB images in the hopper and for planning future images.  You can see the Narrow Band image sequence on my page for this data, but I thought this presentation and the addition of the RGB was unique to give the data it's own page.  The RGB data just wasn't good enough on it's own, even with a luminance set, when compared to the solid Ha data set I had.  So, I created an HaRGB and Blended with the SHO (SCNR green) data.  I also pulled the stars from the NB data as I had to use 2 different scopes for the RGB data and the stars did not line up at the edge of field.  I will reference the NB data set in image acquisition, but the RGB data is also on my profile.  I hope you agree this is a dramatic improvement over the process I was using over 1 year ago.  Thanks to so many for instruction and inspiration in the astrobin community.  Clear Skies.",
