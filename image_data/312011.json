    "description": "I have imaged this target before, with my DSLR. Firsly just RGB, then with Astronomik Clip-in filters in HaRGB and full SHO, the results were interesting :) As Ha data was quite decent from resolution perspective, I've reused it and added it to what I imaged with CCD to add to the sharpness of Ha signal, which was really beneficial. Also this is the first time I applied deconvolution to OIII signal as it was quite strong and provided interesting sharp features which benefited from decon. I've struggled processing this target, redoing it multiple times, then finally figuring out the sharpnes, brightness, contrast for each channel and then struggling again to find the palette I liked. Firsly I managed to get this but the background was bugging me as it was way too vibrant and magenta and it transfered to the nebula itself. Then I just mashed on percentages in pixel math to get something that looked OK, then I just fine tuned percentages to get what was not bugging me, which is the end result and I quite like it :)\r\nThis target was imaged during civil and nautical dark with moon up, one night OIII was imaged during whole night including astrodark.\r\n\r\nDates: 2015-10-08, 2017-08-04, 2017-08-05, 2017-08-07, 2017-08-09, 2017-08-11, 2017-08-13, 2017-08-14, 2017-08-29",
