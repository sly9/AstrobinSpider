    "description": "Went out to a new Bortle 2 site and had great conditions for imaging. Overall, I'm only somewhat happy with this result. When I compare it to some other people's data, it's lacking a lot of detail in the core, but considering I'm only using a color camera for now, I'm okay with it. Hoping to make the leap to monochrome soon so I can get even better images.",
