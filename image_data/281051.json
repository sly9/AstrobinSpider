    "description": "This is a picture has been taken in 2016. In the first try i took 2h in HA and 2h in OIII and i thought that i saw a very faint halo around it. I gave it additional 11h in OIII and it became stronger and stronger. I worked in two different layers to bring that Halo to the front and brought it together with the very strong core.\r\nI found no other pictures with that halo so it is unverified up to now. If somebody has enough material to verify it, please give me a short message.",
