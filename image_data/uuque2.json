    "description": "NGC 6946 is an at least 17' large spiral galaxy in the constellation Cepheus. We look directly from above (or below? :-)) at the galaxy's disk, which is about 12 million light years away.  The large blue structure in the western part of the galaxy is known as the Hodges Complex (Paul Hodge 1967). The object was long thought to be a young supergiant cluster. Meanwhile, however, it is assumed that it is a dwarf galaxy at NGC 6946.\r\nExposure time: L 46x10min / RGB 25x10min per filter, total 20 h.",
