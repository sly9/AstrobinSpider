    "description": "The Taurus molecular cloud is an enormous area of gas and dust located around 400 - 450 light years away from Earth.  Barnard 22 is a small segment of this cloud.  To my eyes, it has the appearance of a creature on horseback (facing leftwards and upwards in this image) – I am reminded of the ‘Black Riders’ – or Nazgul - from the Lord of the Rings.  Hence the title.\r\n\r\nEmbedded within B22 is the emission nebula IC 2087, also known as the Little Flame nebula.  \r\n\r\nBarry and I imaged this target from our rig in Spain between 28 December 2019 and 2 January 2020.  I also had FSQ 106 data from the Deep Sky West facility in New Mexico.  The US data was collected between 23 and 27 January 2017.  I thought that combining both sets of data could be interesting.\r\n\r\nCapture Details:\r\n\r\nTelescopes: Takahashi FSQ 106 x 2\r\nMounts: 10 Micron GM 1000 HPS & Paramount MyT\r\nCameras: QSI 683 x 2\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\n\r\nLum: 41 x 600s (Spain); 30 x 900s (US)\r\nRed: 24 x 600s (Spain); 20 x 900s (US)\r\nGreen: 24 x 600s (Spain); 20 x 900s (US)\r\nBlue: 24 x 600s (Spain); 20 x 900s (US)\r\n\r\nTotal exposure = 41 hours and 20 minutes",
