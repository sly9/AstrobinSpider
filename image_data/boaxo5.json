    "description": "Five years ago I made my first attempt at this amazing cluster using a Celestron 8\" in an urban 19.5 SQM sky...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/244071/\">Coma Cluster using Celestron 8\" in 19.5 SQM sky</a>\r\n\r\nFor my revisit 5 years later using a 24\" in a 21.3+ SQM sky, I was very fortunate to have 8 consecutive nights of clear, dark and steady skies with seeing between 1.6\" and 2.3\" for Luminance and 1.4\" to 2.9\" for RGB.\r\n\r\nThis is a 2-panel LRGB mosaic with 6:3:3:3 hours per panel for a total of 30 exposure hours.\r\n\r\nFor the merge, I used PI GradientMergeMosaic after StarAlignment Register/Union - Seperate. DBE was used on frames prior to and after the merge to help smooth gradients.\r\n\r\nFraming was a little tricky to avoid cutting into any significant galaxies. The glow at the lower left is from a cropped-out bright star, similar to the one above, that was uncomfortably close to the frame edge.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to note that the full extent of this cluster was not understood until it was more thoroughly studied in the 1950s by astronomers at Mount Palomar Observatory, only a few miles away from this location.\r\n\r\n\"The Coma Cluster is a large cluster of galaxies that contains over 1,000 identified galaxies. Along with the Leo Cluster, it is one of the two major clusters comprising the Coma Supercluster. It is located in and takes its name from the constellation Coma Berenices.\r\n\r\nThe cluster's mean distance from Earth is 321 million light years. The central region is dominated by two supergiant elliptical galaxies: NGC 4874 and NGC 4889. Most of the galaxies that inhabit the central portion of the Coma Cluster are ellipticals. Both dwarf and giant ellipticals are found in abundance in the Coma Cluster.\r\n\r\nAbout 90% of the mass of the Coma cluster is believed to be in the form of dark matter.\"",
