    "description": "Hi all, \r\n\r\nSaturn on May 05 with fair seeing and good transparency! We are still distant from it and therefore also from the opposition, but little by little the details are getting more and more interesting. \r\n\r\nIn the first image, on the left, an IR / UV cut filter (L filter) was used to capture the colors and details visible to the human eye. In the middle image, an infrared pass filter of> 685nm was used to highlight details below the layer. of fog that covers a good part of the multicolored bands of the planet. As the infrared is not visible to the human eye, we combine this image with the color image in order to generate an image with the real colors but with the highlighted bands coming from the infrared, image on the right.\r\n\r\nAs people have different preferences for viewing the planet (some like the image with north up while others like with the south up), we also did two viewing modes, the first 3 being the north up and the 3 from the last line with the south facing upwards.\r\n\r\nhugs,\r\nGabriela and Fabio",
