    "description": "Moon 3 days and 8 hours before the new moon, September 14, 2020. For three days, when the south-west libration was deepening (W-6.8°; S-4.3°), I was getting ready for this sight - here is the remarkably plastic Bailly, behind him Le Gentil and Drygalski, and on the right Hausen with a subtly outlined crest of shadows at the west crown. It is Hausen that benefits most from the large southern libration, otherwise it would not be visible. The area has traces of the \"great demolition\" that took place when a large asteroid crashed into the lunar surface to form Mare Orientale. You can see radially arranged ditches, ridges, chains of craters.\r\nThe concavities of the polar regions are opposed by the convex crater of Wargentin marked by accident with the sign \"X\". Next to it, there are two other massive shadow craters: Nasmyth and Phocylides, and the vast Schickard, which, however, gives way in size to the 300 km long \"walled plain\" of Bailly (an old euphemism for a great crater).",
