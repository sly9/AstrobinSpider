    "description": "This is a 7-panel mosaic covering the main part of the Orion constellation, and the interesting deep-sky objects within.  I'm still a beginner when it comes to mosaics, so it took me a very long time to complete the processing.  Each of the 7 panels consisted of 10 frames taken with a Nikon D750 + Rokinon 135mm f/2 lens at f/3.2 - ISO 1600 - 90\".  The frames were stacked in Deep Sky Stacker.  Next I processed each stack/panel individually, dealing with gradients and other issues before using Photoshop to stitch them together.  Once stitched together, the final processing was performed in Photoshop.",
