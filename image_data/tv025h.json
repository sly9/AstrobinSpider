    "description": "I really like this interesting galaxy with it's blue spiral arms. It's not photographed very often, which is a little surprising to me, when it's so beautiful.üòÉ\r\nThe galaxy has an active galactic nucleus with a supermassive black hole. Together with NGC 5005 it forms a pair that weakly influences each other.\r\nThis is my last image before the corona virus shutdown, let's see how long it takes now.üôÅ",
