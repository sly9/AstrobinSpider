    "description": "NGC 7640 is a barred spiral galaxy in Andromeda constellation. \r\nIt has apparent diameter of 10.5’x1.8’ and a magnitude 11.3; its distance from the Earth is 29 million of light years. \r\nIts spiral structure is not so evident due to the angle of view: anyway it can be observed some distortion in the galaxy structure, so it is likely that in the past there was a gravitational interaction with another galaxy. \r\nThis is my first image of a galaxy taken with my new OTA RC12.\r\n\r\nwww.robertomarinoni.com",
