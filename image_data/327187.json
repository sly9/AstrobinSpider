    "description": "Also called the 'Tadpoles', the 2 main dust pillars are a product of leftover dust and gas from the creation of new stars in the associated open star cluster NGC 1893. Radiation and stellar winds from this local star formation are what give these pillars their unique shape. The Tadpoles themselves are roughly 10 light years long and are potentially the sites of ongoing star birth\r\n\r\nIndex Catalog (IC) object 410 is located in the constellation Auriga at about 12,000 light years from Earth. Right now Auriga can be seen rising in the east just after dark on a clear night. It's situated just to the left of Taurus and above Gemini. The Brightest star in Auriga is Capella which is actually a system of 4 stars in two binary pairs. Capella is the 6th brightest star in the night sky.\r\n\r\nI took this image through 3 narrowband filters which only allow a very small bandwidth of light to hit the camera sensor. Similar to the Hubble Space Telescope color pallet, I mapped the Sulphur II filter to red, Hydrogen alpha to green and Oxygen III to blue. The image contains about 18 hours of data taken over 3 nights from my backyard in Southern Maryland. The Ha data is from 2016 and the SII and OIII from November of 2017",
