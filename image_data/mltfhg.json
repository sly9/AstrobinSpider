    "description": "On the night of May 1, two tiny comets made a close encounter in the Earth's night sky. The smaller one on the left is C/2020 T2 Palomar, while the larger one on the right is C/2020 R4 ATLAS. In fact, they were still hundreds of millions of kilometers apart, but happened to appear in the same direction of the Earth's perspective. The two comets went their separate ways soon after, and it will be a long time before they meet each other again.",
