    "description": "This is a collaboration with <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/users/jerryyyyy/>Jerome Yesavage</a>, to whom I must apologize because I badly screwed up my acquisition and foiled our original plans of creating one of the best images of Jacoby1 out there. Unfortunately, my flockboard had shifted at some point during capture and covered part of my focuser, leading to all sorts of calibration problems and subpar data. Pro tip: Don't block the light you're trying to capture. This is partly why I sat on these data for nearly a year (sorry, bud!). \r\n\r\nLuckily for you, Mark Stiles (who helped me out with this one) did in fact publish <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/81iacs/>the best image of Jacoby 1</a> to date yesterday, so please head over to his page to view a superior image of this target. The detail Mark achieved inside the ring of the nebula is simply astounding!\r\n\r\nThis is a super faint target. The Ha, in particular, is extraordinarily faint - approx. 7.5 hours of 10 minute subs at medium-high gain revealed literally nothing, which is why all Ha data are from Jerry (and how he got involved in the first place) and why all my Ha data were trashed. All data on my end were collected between March 2, 2019 and July 1, 2019. I contributed 30 hours of OIII and the RGB and Jerry contributed 53.5 hours of Ha and OIII.",
