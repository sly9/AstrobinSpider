    "description": "I recorded activity around this sunspot group most of the week but captured the best activity on these two days.  On the 8th a nice flare was captured between 15:01 and 15:20 UT with peak at 15:10:36 and then some nice eruptive filaments between 15:11 and 16:00 UT on the 9th.  Both animations are 45 minutes in real time.  The flare was captured in SS mode and the filaments in DS mode with a Lunt LS60T and Skyris 236M.  Be sure to check out both revisions as I decided to just load them up on this one post.",
