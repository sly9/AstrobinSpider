This uses 23hrs of LRGB exposure, and I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of detail present. \n\nIf you are interested in help processing your images, like personalized processing videos, zoom meetings, or just edited images, feel free to check out my website here: https://astrofalls.com/\n\nThanks for looking!",
