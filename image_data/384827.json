    "description": "I used some RGB data colleted way back in 2013 (4 hrs with a DSLR, and a barlowed 5\" apo), and combined it with the H-alpha and OIII data from my recent image. The blend was on each channel and on a synthetic luminance: (Lsynth+Ha+OIII)(R+Ha, G+OIII, B+OIII).\r\n\r\nThe result shows much better star colors, and a somewhat softer but more natural image.",
