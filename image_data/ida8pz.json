    "description": "I had some luck in this terrible weather to shoot this object in few recent weeks. This is from my OSC ASI 2600MC plus Ha from ASI 2600MM, hoever the Ha did add only a tiny bit on top of RGB, as the OSC camera is surprisingly sensitive in Ha wavelenghts. I have been able to fine tune my mount to reach the first 50 subs in bin1, scale 0.31 180 sec subs unguided :) But for the sake of speed I turned than to BIN2 as the weather is worst I remember, and chances were poor.",
