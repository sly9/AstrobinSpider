    "description": "The Crescent Nebula NGC6888 in Cygnus. This image combines data acquired in 2018 with my Esprit 150/ASI1600mm with some recent wider field data from my Esprit150/SX-46 and piggybacked Esprit100/ASI1600m.  In total 9hrs Ha, 7hrs Oiii and 30mins each RGB for the stars. Processed in Pixinsight and Photoshop with starless narrowband images made using StarNet module in Pixinsight.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent Nebula (also known as NGC 6888, Caldwell 27, Sharpless 105) is an emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus, about 5000 light-years away from Earth. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1792. It is formed by the fast stellar wind from the Wolf-Rayet star WR 136 (HD 192163) colliding with and energising the slower moving wind ejected by the star when it became a red giant around 250,000 to 400,000 years ago. The result of the collision is a shell and two shock waves, one moving outward and one moving inward. The inward moving shock wave heats the stellar wind to X-ray-emitting temperatures. (Source Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nAlso visible at the lower middle-right is the Soap Bubble Nebula which was discovered by amateur astronomer Dave Jurasevich using an Astro-Physics 160 mm refractor telescope with which he imaged the nebula on June 19, 2007 and on July 6, 2008 (Source Wikipedia)",
