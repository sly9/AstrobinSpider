    "description": "The Elephant Trunk Nebula is a bright nebulous region in Cepheus. It lies 3,000 light years from Earth, and is hundreds of light years across. The Elephant Trunk nebula contains several very young stars ( less than 100,000 years old) that were discovered in 2003.The combined action of the massive  star ionizing the rim of the cloud, and the wind from the young stars at its center blowing outward, generates very high compression in the Elephant Trunk. This is thought to have triggered the formation of protostars.   Info. from SkySafari Pro.\r\nSeeing 6/10",
