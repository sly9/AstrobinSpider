    "description": "NGC 247 is an spiral galaxy in the constellation Cetus, and a member of the Sculptor Group. NGC 247 is a fairly bright galaxy (magnitude 8.9) elongated 19' x 5' in position angle 170 degrees. The halo is tear dropped shaped, its northern portion broader and more diffuse and its southern end brighter and pointed. The 9th magnitude star at the southern (lower, in the image) edge clearly lies within the halo. The central area is mottled and brightens gradually to an irregularly extended core. At least seven faint stars are embedded in the halo (hard to count in the image, though). The surrounding star field is somewhat sparse.\r\n\r\nNGC 247 is about 12.2 million light years away, and one of several galaxies gravitationally bound to the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253, not shown). These galaxies form a small core in the center of the Sculptor Group, which includes NGC 55, 253, 300, and 7793 (all out of scope, not shown). All are late-type spirals, and they form the nearest collection of galaxies outside of our own. Most other galaxies associated with the Sculptor Group are only weakly gravitationally bound to this core.",
