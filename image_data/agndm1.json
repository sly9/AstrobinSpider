    "description": "Messier 13 or M13 (and NGC6207 in the photo), sometimes called the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules or the Hercules Globular Cluster, is a globular cluster of several hundred thousand stars in the constellation of Hercules.\r\n\r\nM13 is about 145 light-years in diameter, and it is composed of several hundred thousand stars, the brightest of which is a red giant, the variable star V11, with an apparent visual magnitude of 11.95. M13 is about 22,200 light-years away from Earth.\r\nIt wasn't until 1779 that the single stars in this globular cluster were resolved. Compared to the stars in the neighborhood of the Sun, the stars in M13's stellar population are more than a hundred times denser. They are so densely packed together that they sometimes collide and produce new stars. The newly-formed, young stars, so-called \"blue stragglers,\" are particularly interesting to astronomers.\r\nThe Arecibo message of 1974, which contained encoded information about the human race, DNA, atomic numbers, Earth's position and other information, was beamed from the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope towards M13 as an experiment in contacting potential extraterrestrial civilizations in the cluster. The cluster will move through space during the transit time; opinions differ as to whether or not the cluster will be in a position to receive the message by the time it arrives.\r\n\r\nSource: Wikipedia\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis image is shot during my holiday in America (Limburg, The Netherlands) using an Altair Astro Ritchey Chretien 10\" telescope on an NEQ6 Pro mount. Camera used is an Atik 383L+ mono with Astrodon Luminance and RGB filters. Astro-Physics CCDT67 as a reducer. The image is composed of 3Hr Luminance data and 1,5 Hr RGB.\r\n\r\nTotal exposure is 4,5 Hr.",
