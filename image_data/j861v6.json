    "description": "VDB152 in Cepheus \r\n\r\nLots of things going on here and this is \"close\" to the shark nebula. This whole region has a lot of interesting ghostly looking object in a field of colorful sea of stars. This has been long in my imaging list and with the list of clear nights we have had this fall, I was able to snag it!\r\n\r\nVDB152 itself refers to the reflection nebula at the end (head) of the snake like nebula (which itself has a designation of Barnard 175). There is HerbigHaro 450 in that region as well (A jet from proto star - not very well resolved here)   The red filament going south west is a part of SNR (SNR 110.3+11)!  The SNR would be even more impressive with Ha data, however, I didnt have a chance to grab enough Ha to add it here (Which is a good thing as I tend get lost mixing Ha data in LRGB resulting in some weird star colors :D)\r\n\r\n\r\nL - 63x10 minutes\r\nR/G/B - 12x10 minutes each",
