    "description": "Hi all.\r\nThis is an interesting compact group of galaxies in Pegasus.\r\nLuminance was taken by my C11 @2000 mm, while colours by a C8HD @2100 mm from my balcony.\r\nColours frames do not cover entirely the luminance frame, due to the slight different focal length between scopes, so the lower left corner lacks of colours.\r\nSpikes were added during the post-processing workflow.\r\nAnyway, lovely galaxies with lots of tidal streams and faint IFN all around.\r\nEnjoy\r\nLorenzo",
