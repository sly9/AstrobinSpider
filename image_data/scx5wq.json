    "description": "We finally had some clear skies a few nights ago following some thunderstorm which cleared the atmosphere of bushfire smoke and dust storms. Lovely to be under the stars again!\r\n\r\nHave captured some more m78 luminance data to blend with OSC subs from Jan 2019. This has allowed me to attempt a repro. Blending of luminance data plus more careful use of star/range masks seems to have improved things a bit from my previous attempts.\r\n\r\nI always enjoy viewing images of m78, and find the dynamics visible within the Herbigâ€“Haro objects to be fascinating.",
