    "description": "A 180Â° panorama of the aurora borealis from the Churchill Northern Studies Centre, Churchill, Manitoba on March 18, 2020. The Kp Index did reach to 4 this night in a fairly active display that lasted all night, though with no very bright substorms. Some members of the Learning Vacations aurora group are out enjoying and shooting the show. Others are inside keeping warm observing in the aurora viewing dome and lounge. \r\n\r\nThis is an 8-segment panorama with the Sony a7III camera at ISO 1600 for 10 seconds each with the Venus Optics 15mm lens at f/2. Stitched with Photoshop.",
