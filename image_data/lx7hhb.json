    "description": "Here we have a 2021 edition of the M42 area.  I try to not image the same subjects more than once but there are a couple of exceptions to my not hard-and-fast rule.  This subject for me, and I'm sure for a lot of other folks, was my first try at a DSO when I began doing this https://www.astrobin.com/full/336690/0/ .   \r\n\r\nSo it's sort of a benchmark for me to graphically illustrate my progress over time.  The other subject I do over again is the Pleiades but I do that one more to compare different instruments.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, my objective with this one was to try to render it in a natural way although I realize there is no standard for that.  I used the Ha HDR integration with the extracted lightness from my RGB work and made an Ha enhanced L channel and then combined it with my RGB image.  I also used the Ha data in combination with the R data to make an enhanced red channel for the RGB image.  \r\n\r\nI'm pretty pleased with the image in an overall sense but have come to the realization that I probably need to replace my beloved ASI1600 as the ASI1600 bright star problems are readily apparent in the image.  I think I could probably \"fix\" that but I opted not to take the time to do it.\r\n\r\nI hope you like this one and and clear skies and good health to everyone!",
