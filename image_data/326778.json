    "description": "I've been working on this scope for nearly two years. I've finally got it together ready for testing and this is the first image taken with it.. The telescope is a 10inch Dall-Kirkham fully corrected across a 50mm field F6.8 the camera is a full frame Starlight Xpress H35, Mount is a G41.  So far the scope is performing amazingly....although I do have a little tilt on the sensor and I need to refine the optical spacing very slightly. To be honest I just couldn't wait to start imaging with it so Ill tweak it a little later on. Collimation is a breeze with no special tools needed and can all be done very easily on a star. To say I'm pleased would be an understatement. \r\n M45  a single 20min exposure in each  LRGB filter\r\nThanks for taking a look",
