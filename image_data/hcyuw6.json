    "description": "NGC 3572 - This interesting nebula sits beside NGC 3576 the Statue of Liberty nebula in Carina. I managed to fit it in the same frame as NGC 3576 but I felt the orientation of the two clashed so I have isolated out just this area of nebulosity. This is my longest integration to date by more than double. Processed in PixInsight with no noise reduction other than Mure Denoise after integration.",
