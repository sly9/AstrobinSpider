    "description": "Had several good nights here in Germany over the last time. So I began the project \"the cone\". Over six nights I exposed on it with several settings on the ASI 1600 mm pro. Best filter was the Baader H alpha 7 nm  with gain 300 and 350 sec. Coloring was quite tough, because green and blue data was very flaw under my polluted sky. Combining and processing took about 15 h of my holiday. But it was was pure fun with my hobby. I wish you all the best for 2020 and may your nightsky always be clear.",
