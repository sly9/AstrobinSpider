    "description": "NGC 6559, often overlooked due to its neighbor the Lagoon Nebula (see https://astrob.in/akrplm/0/ ), is a fascinating region of varying forms and hues.\n\nBluish reflection nebulae are embedded within clouds of dust along with reddish glowing hydrogen gas that fills the field of view. Delicately drizzled dust clouds float in the foreground (my favorite feature). In fact there is so much dust here that most stars are reddened by the intervening material.\n\nThis place is towards the center of our galaxy some 5,000 light years distant.  I hope your weekend, like this new image, is full of color and light and the potential for new things!\n\nRemember, if you like this kind of pictures being published here please become a follower of this page.\n\n-Adam",
