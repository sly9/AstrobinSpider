    "description": "Working through some of the data I collected from my remote rig (Shared with Dhaval Brahmbhatt) at Marathon, TX.  It is clear to me that I need to rework my setup . I may need to switch to a larger camera chip (The new ASI6200MM is intriguing) or switch to a scope like AGO 10' IDK . I couldnt push the data as much I wanted to. The stars fall apart well before the point I want to push it. \r\n\r\nAnyways, This data is\r\nL - 110x5 minutes\r\nR/G/B - 20x5 minutes",
