    "description": "Looking at old data, I realized the possibility of creating a new panorama.\r\nIt is a mosaic of two panels where we recognize the beautiful Gulf of Iris (Sinus Iridum), then on its right, a dark band, Mare Frigoris, adorned with the crater Harpalus, and more to the right Pythagoras with its central mountains to the Sun.\r\nI gave an unconventional orientation to the image, on the one hand to change the usual perspective, but also and above all in order to be able to visualize in the best axis and suddenly all these lunar reliefs.",
