    "description": "IC 348 is a star-forming region in the constellation Perseus located about 1000 light years away. It consists of nebulosity and an associated 2-million-year-old cluster that is responsible for the reflection nebula, VdB 19. The cluster has at least 15 stars larger than our sun, over 300 stars of all sizes, and 26 brown dwarf stars. Extending to the right of the cluster a gaseous, dusty area includes the dark nebula Barnard 3.  I had an unusual stretch of clear nights while on vacation last month and was able to capture this area. This is my version of IC 348:\r\n\r\nCanon 6D modified\r\nISO 1600\r\n100 x 300 sec\r\nSV80ST at 480 mm f/6\r\nCEM60",
