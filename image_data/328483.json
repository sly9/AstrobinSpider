    "description": "Reuploading since the other one was too large to open in full res. It seems this one is working though now, so I strongly encourage viewing in full resolution. Sorry for reposting! \r\n\r\nCradled in cosmic dust and glowing hydrogen, stellar nurseries in Orion the Hunter lie at the edge of giant molecular clouds some 1,500 light-years away. At 1,500 light years away, the Great Orion Nebula is the closest large star forming region, here visible just right and below center. To its left are the Horsehead Nebula, M78, and Orion's belt stars. Of course, the Orion Nebula and bright stars are easy to see with the unaided eye, but dust clouds and emission from the extensive interstellar gas in this nebula-rich complex, are too faint and much harder to record. In this mosaic of broadband telescopic images, additional image data acquired with a narrow hydrogen alpha filter was used to bring out the pervasive tendrils of energized atomic hydrogen gas like in the arc of the giant Barnard's Loop.\r\n\r\nSource: APOD\r\n\r\nThis is a composition of images taken with a 135mm Rokinon f/2 lens, combined with data from the FSQ-106 in order to get a better look at the main objects. All data has been taken from Deep Sky West remote observatory. It should absolutely be viewed in full resolution to see just detailed it is.\r\n\r\nAll processing was done in PixInsight and is by far the longest I've spent editing an image.",
