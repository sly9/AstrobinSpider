NGC 1360 is a Planetary nebula identified as such due to its strong radiation in the Oxygen III spectrum. There are small areas of Hydrogen alpha and a pair of reddish colored jets which appear to have been ejected when the central star collapsed. \r\nImaged in HOO at Obstech, Chile\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\r\nSystem Control: Voyager by Leo Orazi",
