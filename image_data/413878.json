    "description": "WR 134 is a variable Wolf-Rayet star located around 6,000 light years away from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus, surrounded by a faint bubble nebula blown by the intense radiation and fast wind from the star. It is five times the radius of the sun, but due to a temperature over 63,000 K it is 400,000 times as luminous as the sun. \r\n\r\nThe star in question in right in the Center of the image.  \r\n\r\nThe destarred O-III and HA are interesting in themselves especially the O-III radiations from around the star.",
