    "description": "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nfollows image of the lunar south pole region, one of the most beautiful areas of our heavenly companion! The sensation of \"overflight\" is noticeable in this region due to the curvature of the moon and the relatively low incidence angle of sunlight, which creates fantastic light and shadow effects, further highlighting the lunar relief. Due to constant sun exposure and areas of eternal darkness, the south pole of the moon is a place with innumerable advantages for human exploration. This apparent contradiction is what makes it so precious for future energy resources !! In certain areas of constant light, the use of large solar panels for power generation is facilitated, and areas of eternal darkness have proved to be large reservoirs of water ice that can be used to produce hydrogen and oxygen, key elements for rocket propulsion. and, of course, water, indispensable for a future human colony on the moon. NASA's Artemis III mission that aims to put astronauts back on the moon's surface aims to land right on the moon's south pole in 2024. So I think in the future not far away, this will be the postcard of the first human colony off earth.. a new place to call home.",
