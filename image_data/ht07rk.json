    "description": "I wanted to see on one last image what was still possible to perceive on the planet.\r\nWell, with 8 arc secs in diameter is really the limit.\r\nI compared an image of 20 arc secs that presents the same Martian relief (Syrtis Major in particular).\r\nThe loss of definition is of course very clear. One recognizes however still Syrtis Major and also Hellas Basin. The northern polar cap with its blue colour is still visible while the northern, white ice cap has disappeared.\r\nThe planet now has a gibbous aspect like our satellite.",
