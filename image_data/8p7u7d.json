    "description": "STROTTNER-DRECHSLER 1 / COCO'S NEBULA\r\n\r\nStDr1 (PNG 185.1+-0.9) is a new spectrum confirmed planetary nebula (PN) in the constellation of Taurus.\r\nThe PN was discovered in October 2019 by myself and my friend Xavier Strottner and photographed by our friend Rochus Hess.\r\nThe potential central star of StDr 1 is located at coordinates 05:53:48.86 +24:02:41.45.\r\nIf this star is used as a calculation basis, then StDr 1 is located at a distance of 9203 light years from Earth.\r\nFor a PN at this distance, it is unusually bright.\r\nIn addition, this photo was the first to detect an annular H-alpha structure around StDr 1.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nDiscoverers: Marcel Drechsler, Xavier Strottner\r\nPhotographer: Rochus Hess\r\nImage processing: Marcel Drechsler\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nPN-G: 185.1-00.9\r\nCoordinates: 05:53:48.86 +24:02:41.45 (J2000)\r\nDiameter: 4.8 arcminutes\r\nConstellation: Taurus\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nTelescope: 1 metre ASA telescope at the \"Vega Observatory Haus der Natur Salzburg\"\r\nCamera: FLI MicroLine 16803\r\nExposure: 26x20min H-Alpha, 17x20min OIII and 6x5min RGB each, total 15.8 hours\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nmore information: \r\nhttp://202.189.117.101:8999/gpne/objectInfoPage.php?id=32356\r\nhttp://planetarynebulae.net/FR/page_np.php?id=709",
