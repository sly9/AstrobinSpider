    "description": "This galaxy (very rarely imaged by amateurs) has two ring structures; the oval inner ring around the bar and the nearly perfectly circular ring further out. The inner nucleus and bar are very bright and concentrated. NGC 2217 has been imaged by both Hubble and ESO.\r\n\r\nIt might be tempting to call NGC 2217 a “ring galaxy,” but the  Catalog of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and Associations, by Halton Arp and Barry Madore, excludes galaxies where spiral arms have become tightly wound into a circle or near circle.\r\n\r\nNGC 2217 qualifies as a peculiar galaxy in a number of different categories: \r\n\r\nCategory 8: Galaxies with Apparent Companions\r\nCategory 10: Galaxies with Peculiar Spiral Arms\r\nCategory 13: Compact Galaxies (thanks to the very bright core)\r\nCategory 14: Galaxies with Prominent or Unusual Dust Absorption \r\n\r\nTech Notes for ASA 500/3.6:\r\nASA Newtonian, 500 mm aperture, 1900mm focal length, F3.6\r\nFLI Proline 16803, 9 mm pixel, 4096 X 4096\r\nASA DDM85 equatorial mount\r\nProcessing with PixInsight, StarTools, and Affinity Photo",
