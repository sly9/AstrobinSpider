    "description": "NGC 247 is at 70,000 light years across a relatively small spiral galaxy in the constellation of Cetus. It is around 11 million light-years from us, and is part of the Sculptor Group.\nNGC 247’s nucleus is visible as a bright, whitish patch, surrounded by a mixture of stars, gas and dust. The dust forms dark patches and filaments, while the gas has formed into bright knots of Hydrogen Alpha regions, scattered primarily through the galaxy’s arms and outer areas.\nThis galaxy has one very unusual and mysterious feature; The northern part of NGC 247’s disc has an apparent void, a gap that covers nearly a third of the galaxy’s total length.\nThere are stars in this void, but they are different from those around it being significantly older. It appears that star development in this region stopped around 1 billion years ago.\nImaged in LRGB and Hydrogen Alpha at Obstech, Chile.\nImage Processing: Roberto Colombari Mike Selby\nSystem Control Software: Voyager by Leonardo Orazi",
