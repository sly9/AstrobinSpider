Well, I was surprised not to find any color at the end of my process ... ;-)\r\n\r\nIn a way, I was lucky, not to have red , blue or green in excess but lights.\r\n\r\nI had to wait till august to get back to the field , the 6 aund 7 august with RGB.\r\nFinally , I had some time to process them .\r\n\r\n35 L@180s gain 139 -20째C\r\n20 R@180s gain 139 -20째C\r\n20 G@180s gain 139 -20째C\r\n20 B@180s gain 139 -20째C",
