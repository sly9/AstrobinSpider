    "description": "AMU 1 (PN G075.9+11.6) is a bipolar planetary nebula in Cygnus.\r\nAMU 1 is a faint but extremely strange and beautiful planetary nebula with a size of 5x2 arcminutes. It was discovered by the astronomers Alba Aller, Luis Miranda and Ana Ulla in 2013 and was found in the field covered by the Kepler telescope. It has a complex multishell morphology and a series of low ionisation structures and has a binary central star with orbital period of 2.93 days.\r\nAs far as I know, this is the first amateur color photo of this nebula. In appearance, I would even give it a name - \"Peaceful Atom\".\r\n\r\nThis image taken over several nights in September, October 2020.",
