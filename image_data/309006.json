    "description": "I can't believe I captured this!!\r\nThis is a composite of 9 images of the corona, exposures running from 1/4000s to 1/4s, and ISOs 200 and 400.  I used the Pellett method to create the composite.  I'm SO excited about how well this came out!!  \r\n\r\nI used an alt-az mount, and I haven't figured out how to de-rotate and align the images yet, but they were close enough that I think it worked out.\r\n\r\nFor more info on how I made this image, check out my blog! http://astronomollylog.blogspot.com/2017/08/solar-eclipse-corona-composite.html",
