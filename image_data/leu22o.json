    "description": "NGC 1291 is also known as NGC 1269 as it was entered twice in the New General Catalog by two different 19th century observers who did not realize it was the same object. \r\nNGC 1291 is around 33 million light years from Earth and is estimated to be 12 billion years old. It is an unusual galaxy as it is a barred Galaxy that Nasa listed at transitional. This is because while the main part of the galaxy is mature, there is a substantial star forming ring that can be observed mostly beyond the visible light spectrum. \r\nImaged in LRGB\r\nImage Processing: Leo Orazi and MIke Selby",
