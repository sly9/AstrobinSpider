    "description": "This may seem like a simple picture, but in fact, besides counting on luck, it had to be very well planned.\r\nPlanned to catch the precise moment the HD 168233, of magnitude +9.25, was exactly between the ring of Saturn and the globe of the planet. A little before, or shortly after, she would be covered up. . .\r\nTo count on luck, so that the atmospheric conditions would allow the capture at the exact moment. . .\r\nThe truth is, luck always provides persistence, and persistence can bring us unusual results.\r\nAnother photo I had saved for the Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2019 that deserves to be published late.",
