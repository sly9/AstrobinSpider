    "description": "Sh2-129, aka the Flying Bat nebula, is a large emission nebula in the constellation Cepheus. It covers over 2 1/2 degrees of the sky. \r\n\r\nSh2-129 is a faint region as Ha targets go, but is bright compared to the extremely faint Squid nebula, or OU4. The Squid was discovered just 6 years ago in June 2011 by Nicolas Outters.\r\n\r\nOU4 lies within Sh2-129, some 2300 light years away. At this distance, the giant Squid nebula would be nearly 50 light years across.",
