    "description": "ARP147 spans less than an arcminute of sky in the constellation Cetus.   This interacting pair lies around 435 million light years from us, so its easy to see why its so tiny.    The original colliding galaxies were an elliptical (top) and spiral (bottom), but the result is a pair of galaxies containing obvious ring structures.   The face-on (bottom) galaxy underwent massive star formation and many of those energetic stars collapsed into neutron stars and black holes.   These are very visible in X-ray surveys of the area.  \r\n\r\nThe target was a challenge for me and involved collection over many nights.   I originally found it due to the Hubble image of the pair.  So, I thought it would be an interesting comparison to show that against what I could come up with, find it on Rev B.    If anything, its an interesting comparison between a $6k setup and a $6B one.    Credits:\r\nNASA, ESA, and M. Livio (STScI)\r\n\r\nI figured I'd add the comment here, since I just realized it addressing the comments below.   In the sky, this target is roughly the size of Jupiter as seen from Earth.     With that in mind, I'm very happy with the detail I was able to find here.",
