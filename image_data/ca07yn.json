    "description": "===============================\r\nIC-2220 – Toby Jug Nebula\r\nDuring we are continuing acquiring and processing new targets, we present to you some images from the step we were initializing and tuning our set-up, first one is a little nebula without pretentions but we like it :\r\nNot many deep-sky objects show their true colors so readily as the Toby Jug\r\nNebula. This reflection nebula surrounds the bright orange star HR 65750. The dust\r\nthat we see is believed to be the out fl ow of HR 65750 with that dust reflecting the\r\nstars’ color. This bright orange stands out in the field and is easy to see in modest\r\napertures.\r\nThe nebula is not only bipolar but also biconical in nature. The Toby Jug lies at\r\n300 light years from us.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull and details sur Astrobin : https://astrob.in/full/zd9ico/0/\r\n\r\n\r\nFaceBook : https://www.facebook.com/Los-Calvos-Observatory-383526525524141\r\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/loscalvos.elsauce/\r\nWebsite :https://loscalvos-astrophotography.com/",
