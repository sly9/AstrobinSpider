    "description": "Presenting in an annular form but also with a barred central part that persists for a long period of time, the galaxy NGC1291 (also appearing as NGC1269) is in its phase of unfolding its arms. The latest studies place it at about 33 million light years from our Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThis galaxy does not present much signal in H-Alpha but the outer ring is much richer in the ultraviloet which results in a more marked presence in the blue.",
