    "description": "In 1837, John Herschel discovered NGC 6334, or The Cats Paw Nebula.  It’s an emission nebula located in the constellation Scorpius.  Its distance to Earth is 5,500 light years.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to try something a little different with the data set that I have collected over the years on this object.  In the RGB colour space, this object can be a little overwhelming with its strong reds. (note: just my personal tastes coming through)   The strong reds result from the hydrogen rich areas that completely conceal many hot young stars deep within the nebula.  In many cases, these stars are 10 times heavier that our sun and emit massive amounts of ultraviolet light.  The surrounding hydrogen gas absorbs this light, which is then re-emitted as a deep red seen in most photos of this object.   \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this area is one of the most active stellar nurseries of massive stars in our galaxy.    \r\n\r\nLuminance, Red, Green, and Blue filters where used to create the base of the image.  Narrowband channels consisting of Ha, SII, and OIII where added as support data to enhance textures and highlight many areas within this large gas complex.\r\n\r\nWhile the colours may not truly represent the typical RGB colour image, it does highlight many interesting features within.  I like the area that looks like a miniature version of the “Running Man Nebula” found near Orion.  This can be located just above the area that looks like a shark fin (or Star Fleet Icon), just left from the centre part of the image.  It has a slight bluish colour like a reflection nebula.
