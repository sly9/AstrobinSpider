    "description": "Mars has now attained an apparent diameter of 8.1 arc seconds, so about 1/3rd of its eventual dimension at opposition in October. This aspect of Mars with the shield volcanoes is always very rewarding. Orographic clouds are created when humid atmosphere rises up an escapement and in the case of Mars freezes to form tiny ice crystals. Arsia Mons, the most southerly of the Tharsis Montes has a thick cloud mass, visible in the eyepiece, with Pavonis Mons further north having less coverage and Ascraeus Mons, further north again, virtually cloud free. The clouds do extend across towards the Valles Marineris which is beyond the terminator having set when the image was captured. There is also a hint of white orographic cloud on the p (right) side of Olympus Mons further north. Once again the diamond shaped escarpment around the giant volcano is evident.\r\nThe red planet is coming! Or should I said we are coming....to catch up our red brother Mars, as warlike as he is. :-D",
