    "description": "This LRGB image of M64 was quite a struggle as it was windy during the acquisition thus quite a few subs were bad.  Between gusts, seeing was actually quite good.  I again used Astro Pixel Processor to pre-process, stack, and color correct.  There have been big improvements and streamlining when using LRGB thus the process is quite quick and simple now.  Startools was used for the rest of the processing. L 22x300s, RGB 10x200s 2x2 binned.",
