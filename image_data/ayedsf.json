    "description": "Finally, here is my complete SHO variant of the Pacman Nebula. The data are from the first exposures I was able to capture with my new Takahashi CCA in early November. The quality of the raw data was breathtakingly good, which besides the great optics was surely also due to the calm and very transparent sky during these nights. Since that time, by the way, I only see clouds here... In addition, I took a lot of time for image processing and extended and adjusted my workflow a bit. \r\n\r\nI hope you like the deep view inside the Pacman! Have all a merry christmas! :-)",
