    "description": "My favourite DSO\r\nH-alpha: 18×600s\r\nO-III: 9×600s\r\nS-II: 9×600s\r\nC rev. shows NGC 3603 nebula which also containing an open cluster HD 97950. I think it's a really interesting object and fortunately Ha channel shows great detail. According to astronomers, this compact cluster maybe one of the youngest cluster in our galaxy and so many extremely hot young stars inside it, which some of them are Wolf-Rayet Stars, also lots of are forming. The stars in the cluster blow out strong stellar wind that clear the area so we could see it clearly.",
