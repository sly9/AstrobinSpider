    "description": "Hi everyone.\r\nI had this image in my HDD since 2017 and I've completely forgot it since few days ago...\r\nIt is a field including NGC 6946 (firework galaxy) including the supernova SN 2017eaw, rhe open cluster NGC 6939. It was taken under very good sky during an astrocamp. The image is a cooperation between me and Maurizio Mollica and consists of two main frames at different resolutions. Mine, acquired at a medium field and the one from Maurizio at much higher focal ratio and resolution. I've used my image as a basis with a little enlargement using drizzle while reducing the scale of Maurizio's one. I've also managed to add more datas of the field taken during years with different telescopes of similar focal lenght and resoution. A good quantity of IFN is also present and visible in the field.\r\nThanks to Maurizio and to enyone taking time to whatch it.",
