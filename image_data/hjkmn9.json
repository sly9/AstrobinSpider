    "description": "After I got my QHY268C at the beginning of the year, I had no chance to make use of it due to bad weather. Starting with 21.03.2020 I now had a full week of clear nights! And guess what? No moon! :)\r\n\r\nBut not only the camera is new to me. I also build a concrete column in my backyard for my mount. This gives me the possibility to make my setup ready for imaging very quickly. Imaging on weekdays is no issue anymore.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying some easy targets, I ran for the shark. I wanted to test if I can image this dim target at gain 0 for maximum FWC and dynamic range and still get enough signal. \r\nI still have to learn a lot about processing, but the camera definitely delivers great data to work with.",
