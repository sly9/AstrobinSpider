    "description": "There was a lovely image of the day today (15 May 2017) of NGC4725 by Jens. As Franck M106 pointed out, there is also a PN available to those with large chips. The basic widefield was mine, taken at Les Granges with the house TEC140/Atik 11000. The PN data was captured in OIII by Steve Milne in England. Construction in Registar and Photoshop CS3.\r\nOlly",
