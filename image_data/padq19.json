L taken with Moravian G4 - 152mm refractor at 1300mm - and RGB with ASI2600 - 92mm refractor at 490mm.\r\nGreat field to ponder about the distance of objects along our line of sight:  Barnard  150, the Seahorse Nebula is at roughly 1200ly; the cluster NGC6939 at 3860ly and NGC6946, the fireworks galaxy, at 22.5 million ly...",
