    "description": "Started the subs on the 4thMay in Nautical darkness whilst waiting for Abell 46 to rise. Managed a few Red and Blue subs before the unexpected cloud bank rolled in. Collected the Green subs on the 5th, again in nautical darkness, before more clouds rolled in for the night. \r\nRev A: The RGB.\r\nRev B: An extracted Luminance added. It adds just a subtle change to the Globular Cluster.\r\nRev C: A reprocess using the method shown in my M13 image.",
