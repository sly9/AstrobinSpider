    "description": "Omega Centauri (NGC 5139) is the brightest and most spectacular globular cluster in the sky. Located in Centaurus and visible to the naked eye (mag. +3.7) it was believed by early astronomers to be star.\r\nOmega Centauri lies 15,800 light-years distance and spans 36 arc minutes of apparent sky, larger than the apparent diameter of the full Moon. It's estimated to contain 10 Million stars and with a spatial diameter of 170 light-years is also the Milky Way's largest globular.\r\n\r\nFor this image, the capture was in different exposure times in attempt to avoid saturation and data and color loss. The Pixinsight HDR composition helped a lot.",
