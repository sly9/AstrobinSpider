    "description": "NGC 6781 is a planetary nebula in the summer constellation of Aquila.  This is an example of the end stage of a star too small to go supernova, such as our own Sun.  After the hydrogen-fusing period of such a star ends, it will expand to a red giant during which it fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core. After it sheds its outer layers, forming a planetary nebula, it will leave behind a core, which is a white dwarf.  This central star is visible in the image.\r\n\r\nDate: Jul-Aug 2014 data collection, Mar 2020 processing\r\n\r\nLocation: Blue Mountain Vista Observatories,New Ringgold PA\r\n\r\nOptics: Starizona Hyperion f/8 12.5 inch, FL 2540 mm on Paramount ME\r\n\r\nCamera: Apogee U8300 \r\n\r\nGuiding: ST-402 on Innovations Foresight On-Axis Guider and STL-11000 Self guiding\r\n\r\nExposure: HaRGB: Ha:21x20 min R:13x8 min, G:23x4 min, B:23x11 min for a total of 14.5 hrs (80  subs at avg of 652 sec) Ha at bin 2, RGB bin 3\r\nProcessing: Image acquisition using CCD Autopilot.
