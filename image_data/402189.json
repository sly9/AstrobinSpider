    "description": "Iffy transparency continues to plague me, but the seeing was pretty good last night.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, this allowed me to spend some quality time with the collimation of my new C11. (Putting an IR filter in place and using MetaGuide didn't hurt, either.)\r\n\r\nI think this is the first time I've had the time and conditions to nail a decent Airy disk. (It's shockingly small compared to my 6SE ... I never knew how \"easy\" I had it!)\r\n\r\nSo even though there were hazy clouds robbing some detail, I'm pretty happy with how Io turned out in this capture - much better definition than in my other recent images.\r\n\r\nNow to play the waiting game for another clear night ...  :)",
