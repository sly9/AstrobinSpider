    "description": "The little dumbbell nebula was one object of my wishlist for a long time. Now I could give three good nights in the last good weather phase to it. Interesting was, that it isn't as bright in h alpha as I thought. This pic is a HORGB combination and even with the edge 11  at f 7 this PN is a tiny object.  So I decided for a strong crop for some detail on the first view. Hope you like it.",
