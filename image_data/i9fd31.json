    "description": "Added a few hours of NB data to an image from last year, using a different camera. Last years is with an Apogee U8300 (0.89\"/pixel), and this year with a QHY163M (0.626\"/pixel). Everything was registered to the smaller pixel resolution, and since the presented image is a rather small crop, I did a 33% upscale (hence the 0.4\"/pixel result).",
