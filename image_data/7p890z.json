    "description": "This group is a celebrity these days, not only for me but also for others here.\r\n\r\nI personally like the field as a mixture of the prominent M 106, the nice little NGC 4217 and its dust band and the colourful \"star cluster\" around it. This makes it a perfect target for my FOV.\r\n\r\nAlmost exactly a year ago this was already a project of mine with the same setup.\r\nWith longer exposure the result this time is better, especially with less noise. Bringing out the fainter arms is hard stuff for me. It happend for the cost of a brighter core. I wish I could have brought out the details there better.\r\n\r\nHope you like it!",
