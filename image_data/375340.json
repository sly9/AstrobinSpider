    "description": "This image captures a fascinating series of dark, emission and reflection objects in the constellation of Cepheus.  The most famous of these is the red hydrogen emission area Sh2-155, towards the lower left corner of the image.  Better known as the Cave Nebula, it is located 2400 light years away and has a radius of 35 light-years.  The bright rim of ionized hydrogen gas that forms the cave outline is being energized by the radiation from the two bright stars towards the top of the cave.  Looking closely, there appears to be a bluish reflection nebula in this same area.  Numerous dark lanes, aside from the cave itself, extend throughout the left side of the image.  The Cave Nebula object is the 9th object in the Caldwell Catalog.\r\n\r\nA number of other interesting reflection nebulae are seen on the right side of the image.  vdB 155 is the misty blue nebula towards the upper right corner.   Near the center of the right side is an interesting unnamed small nebulae complex which is being illuminated by colorful blue and yellow stars.  The complex consists of a red emission nebula, a dim blue reflection nebula and a dim yellow reflection nebula, along with several small dust lanes.  \r\n\r\nAt the lower right corner is a fascinating small unnamed white reflection nebula surrounding a star.  It looks to be a star trying to break out of its birth cloud, similar in form to NGC 1999 (the Keyhole Nebula), as well as the Hinds and Hubble Variable nebulae.",
