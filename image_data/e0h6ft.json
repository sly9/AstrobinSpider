    "description": "Another attempt at doing LRGB imaging of fainter targets from a SQM 18.7 location.  Pretty pleased overall but color casts around stars and the background were a handful.\r\n\r\nAlso for a change I tried out NINA for the first time - worked really well.  I grabbed v1.10 nightly 76 and took almost 1400 frames and didn't have a single failure or program issue.",
