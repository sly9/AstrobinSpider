    "description": "Messier 33 - Triangulum Galaxy\r\n\r\nThe Triangulum Galaxy is a spiral galaxy 2.73 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Triangulum. It is the third-largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, behind the Milky Way (60% of its size) and the Andromeda Galaxy. \r\n\r\nThe galaxy is the smallest spiral galaxy in the Local Group and is believed to be a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy or on its rebound into the latter due to their interactions, velocities, and proximity to one another in the night sky. It also has an H II nucleus. (Source: Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nI've squeezed this target between the start of the astronomical darkness and the rise of NGC 2264. The beauty of having an autofocuser, is that I didn't have to keep track of the progress while making focus changes per filter in the cold weather. It made adding an LRGB target behind an SHO effortless. I also don't have to pretend anymore (for the sake of my laziness) that R, G and B filters have the same focus point with my apo :)\r\n\r\nClear Skies!",
