    "description": "February weather isn't looking so clear. Fortunately they forecasted a clearing Friday and Saturday night which actually happened. (-:\r\n\r\nGiven I had only 2 days, maybe less, I decided to go for M81. It was high in the sky from 7 PM to 5 AM, thus giving lots of capture time.\r\n\r\nSkies started out very steady Friday night for about an hour of Luminance (2.2\" FWHM) followed by an hour of each R, G and B (3\" FWHM). Then the wind picked up at 2 AM and the night was over.\r\n\r\nSaturday was great all night. 21.3 SQM, perfectly clear, and 5 minutes subs down to 1.7\" FWHM. I captured 6 hours of L, more RGB and even 2.5 hours of Ha. This replaced some of the less steady L and RGB from Friday.\r\n\r\nI would have liked to capture more steady RGB for better star color. Luckily there's not a lot of really bright stars, so the 3\" RGB data is not that noticeable. (-:\r\n\r\n\"Messier 81 (also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's Galaxy) is a grand design spiral galaxy about 12 million light-years away, with a diameter of 90,000 light years, in the constellation Ursa Major. \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that M81 contain over 200 globular clusters.\r\n\r\nOnly one supernova has been detected in Messier 81. The supernova, named SN 1993J, was discovered on 28 March 1993 by F. Garc√≠a in Spain. At the time, it was the second brightest supernova observed in the 20th century.\"",
