    "description": "Messier 63 (NGC 5055, or the Sunflower Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici consisting of a central disc surrounded by many short spiral arm segments, the galaxy form known as flocculent. M63 is part of the M51 Group, a group of galaxies that also includes M51 (the 'Whirlpool Galaxy'). M63 is an active galaxy with a LINER nucleus. The existence of a super massive black hole at the nucleus is possible.\r\n\r\nM63 was discovered by Pierre MÃ©chain on June 14, 1779. The galaxy was then listed by Charles Messier as object 63 in the Messier Catalogue.  In the mid-19th century, Lord Rosse identified spiral structures within the galaxy, making this one of the first galaxies in which such structure was identified.\r\n\r\nIn 1971, a supernova with a magnitude of 11.8 appeared in one of the arms of M63.\r\n(Wikipedia)",
