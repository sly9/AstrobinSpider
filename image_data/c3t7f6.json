    "description": "Here my first try on this iconic galaxy. I waited till optimum position in fading zenit for this beauty because of best resolution and light pollution gradient from the Frankfurt airport, I have to deal with when imaging from my backyard. In the beginning the livestack didn't show that stunning dust structures as I hoped, but nevertheless resolution was quite nice. So I decided for patience and a huge amount of short stacks. I tried both, the CLS filter and the UV/IR filter for luminence. Both had their own advantages and disadvantages but were great for a combination. For telling something about taking the color images, I can say that red was easy, green ok ,but blue was difficult, due to light pollution, why I decided for some more frames here. I hope you like the result of the processing marathon which you can see now here.\r\n\r\nCS, Christoph",
