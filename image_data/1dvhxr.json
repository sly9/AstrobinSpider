    "description": "This delicate OIII bubble is one of my favorite targets. I have imaged this twice in the last couple of years. Once with ASI1600 and another with QHY814 CCD.\r\n\r\nI had shot Ha, OIII with both camera and R/G/B for strars with the QHY814CCD. But I had not processed image with RGB stars.\r\n\r\nThis time, I processed this with all data I have however I realize the Ha is very weak (most of the time is spent on OIII). I need to get more Ha and get that red Ha shimmering through this bubble next.\r\n The final tally is\r\n\r\nOIII = 40x1200s , 57x600s\r\nHa = 20x600s\r\nR/G/B = 12x 180s / channel",
