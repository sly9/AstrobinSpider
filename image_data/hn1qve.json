    "description": "My big summer project and also the biggest project I ever tackled in my 2-year astrophotography career.  This object was definitely one of the hardest in post-processing, Ou4 literally drove my crazy. After about 5 hours on the OIII Channel I saw a first hint of some data ;-)\r\n\r\nAll in all 54.8 hours of exposure time over a period of 3 months (18 nights) between July and September and countless hours of processing went into this image.\r\n\r\nMany other images of this object only used Halpha and OIII filters to create a bi-color image. However, I decided to add another 14 hours in the SII channel to add a touch of gold/yellow along its rim.\r\n\r\nI just hope that I didn't overprossed it, after so many weeks I just want to call it a day :D",
