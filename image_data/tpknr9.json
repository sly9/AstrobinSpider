    "description": "This was the first mosaic (2 rows x 1 column) I have processed in a while, was a bit rusty. Eventually figured it out and managed to get a decent rendition of the wispy tendrils that make up this cloud of gas and dust. The stars are a little dodgy in areas and would like to bring out some more of the fainter dust without increasing noise levels, but got to a stopping point so this one gets pinned to the wall.\r\n\r\nAmazing object though and the tip of the 'chin' has some amazing depth and 3d structure. Will be revisiting one day for sure!",
