I’ve had to take a step back from astrophotography due to starting a new job. I’ve had to let several clear (moonless!) nights go by without capturing data because the job has me getting up as early as 5:00 a.m. Since I still don’t use an autofocuser or a sequence program for capture, I just haven’t had the energy. I’m asking for an autofocuser for my birthday/Christmas so that I can still continue this hobby. I miss it like crazy.\r\n\r\n2. I managed to damage my AZ-EQ5’s tripod. Skywatcher’s customer service is great, but it’s a little slow for my tastes (it’s also like a one-man show though). Here’s hoping they can get me some replacement parts sometime next month. On the plus side: I finally got my Sharpstar working for the most part… but with my AZ-EQ5 in the condition that it’s in… Well, here’s hoping next summer turns out better than this one did.\r\n\r\nI apologize for having not gone through my feed in well over a month – I have over 1200 images in my Astrobin feed that I haven’t looked at yet. I’ve been sitting on this dataset for a while and I have another two that I’m honestly not sure I can even process until late December. I really only tackled this now because I’m trying to put together a calendar for my family for Christmas and need to get it printed! Clear skies, everybody!",
