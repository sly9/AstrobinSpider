    "description": "NGC 3521 is a spiral galaxy located on the celestial equator in the \"head\" of Leo, the Lion.\r\n\r\nThis impressive galaxy is both large (9.5' diameter) and bright (mag 8.9). It could have been easily seen by Messier. But it is often overlooked in favor of its neighbors M 65, M 66, and NGC 3628 (the \"Leo Triplet\"), not shown. Structurally, NGC 3521 is remarkably similar to M 63, though it is inclined at a slightly different angle. It has a very bright, almost starlike core, and a prominent halo (shown).\r\n\r\nNGC 3521 is a type SABbc spiral galaxy 35 million light-years distant. It exhibits normal kinematic properties of gas and stars along its major axis.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple LRGB composition with relatively short frame exposure (300s).",
