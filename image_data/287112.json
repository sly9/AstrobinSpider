    "description": "* Acquisition: iTelescope-Portugal.\r\n* Processing: Ruben Barbosa.\r\n* Distance: 15 Mly.\r\n\r\n* See also: <a href=\"http://www.astrobin.com/325891\">M83</a>, close-up.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Pinwheel Galaxy (M83, NGC 5236 or Milky Rubies Galaxy) is a barred spiral located approximately 15 million light-years away, in the direction of the Hydra constellation. It is about 40.000 light-years across, it is the dominant galaxy of the M83 group, along with Centaurus A and NGC 5253.\r\n\r\nThe red / pink areas that we observe in the image are diffuse nebulae while the blue dots are newly formed stellar clusters. This combination of colors led to it being known as the Thousand-Ruby Galaxy. Between the arms there are regions of low stellar density and dark clouds that accompany the spiral structure. In the distant plane, it is possible to observe two galaxies to the left of the M83.",
