    "description": "Once again The Great Turkey Nebula flies again. For those of you who have not seen this before, The Great Turkey Nebula only appears one day of the year, Thanksgiving. Apparently it was going by GMT and I was able to get some RGB data early to add to the NB data captured the last couple of years.\r\n\r\nAnd like every year, The Great Turkey Nebula wishes everyone \r\na Very Merry and Happy Thanksgiving. :-D",
