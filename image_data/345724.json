    "description": "This object is one of the sky's best globular clusters, located 25,000 light years away in the constellation of Hercules.  This cluster contains about 300,000 stars and is about 145 light-years in diameter. It is considered to be the finest globular star cluster in the northern half of the heavens. \r\n\r\nLooking at the image in high resolution, I am surprised at the number of stars that are resolved.  The core looks very dense, with stars packed against each other, although I know that there is actually a tremendous amount of space between each star.  Some of the brighter stars on the outside of the cluster appear to line up in arcing asterisms.\r\n\r\nA faint galaxy (IC 4617) is visible towards the upper right edge of the image.",
