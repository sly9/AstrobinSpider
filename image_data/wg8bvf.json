    "description": "Inspired by AlexBB's stunning recent Iris Nebula image I thought I'd have first attempt at this one too given the brief two days of relative clear skies at new moon between the otherwise constant rain.  This is approx 15 hours over two nights (bortle 5), mostly luminence with about 90 mins each for RGB. 2 min exposures at unity gain with the 1600MM & Esprit 80.",
