    "description": "Omega Centauri is not the most photogenic of astronomical objects.  \r\n\r\nBut it is one of the few DSOs one can target with broadband during full moon.  Since I have set myself a target of completing all the accessible \"Top 93\" targets in Bracken's astrophotography atlas (Omega Cen is amongst then) I took advance of the recent full moon to knock this one off the list.    Took LRGB, but didn't bother with L data because I forgot to take L flats. \r\n\r\nR 30 x 60sec\r\nG 30 x 60sec\r\nB 30 x 60sec",
