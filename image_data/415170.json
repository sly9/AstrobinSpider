    "description": "First light with my new WO RedCat 51m. I didn't spend a lot of time on this image because it became evident that there is some tilt and coma going on. The stars look pretty bad in one corner as compared to the opposite corner. Not sure yet if it is the scope or a piece of my equipment? All of my connections are machined threaded parts that I have used with other scopes and they have shown very little to no tilt at all. I have this sinking feeling something might be off with the RedCat. Anyways, next clear night I get I plan to attach only the camera and see if the stars look acceptable. That way I eliminate the OAG, filter wheel and a spacer. Wish me luck! LoL!\r\n\r\nImage analysis  https://astrob.in/415284/0/",
