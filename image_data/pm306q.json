    "description": "From APOD: \"Colorful NGC 1579 resembles the better known Trifid Nebula, but lies much farther north in planet Earth's sky, in the heroic constellation Perseus. About 2,100 light-years away and 3 light-years across, NGC 1579 is, like the Trifid, a study in contrasting blue and red colors, with dark dust lanes prominent in the nebula's central regions. In both, dust reflects starlight to produce beautiful blue reflection nebulae. But unlike the Trifid, in NGC 1579 the reddish glow is not emission from clouds of glowing hydrogen gas excited by ultraviolet light from a nearby hot star. Instead, the dust in NGC 1579 drastically diminishes, reddens, and scatters the light from an embedded, extremely young, massive star, itself a strong emitter of the characteristic red hydrogen alpha light.\"\r\n\r\nNGC 1579 was photographed between 23 October 2019 and 1 January 2020 from a rig in Spain that is privately owned and remotely operated by Barry Wilson and me.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC 140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 30 x 1200s\r\nLum: 36 x 600s\r\nRed: 30 x 300s\r\nGreen 30 x 300s\r\nBlue: 30 x 300s\r\n\r\nA total of 23 hours and 30 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Steve Milne",
