    "description": "The “Pillars of Creation” in the Eagle Nebula (Messier 16) located 7,000 light years away near the tail of Serpens. Also known as the Star Queen Nebula, this emission nebula lies in the Sagittarius-Carina inner spiral arm and surrounds a young open star cluster, a majestic sight.\r\n\r\nThe pillars are composed of cool molecular hydrogen gas and dust that are being sculpted and eroded by photo-evaporation caused by ultraviolet light of relatively close hot stars. The longest pillar (in the central-most pillar complex) is about four light years in length. These columns (which resemble stalagmites) are incubators of new stars. Inside the columns and on their surface astronomers have found knots or globules of denser gas, called EGGs (\"Evaporating Gaseous Globules\"). Stars (suns) are being formed/condense inside some of these ’EGG’ structures. \r\n\r\nStill working on this image, and plan on collecting 3 times the existing exposure to intensify the otherwise ultra-faint signal of the Eagle Nebula.\r\n\r\nImage created from 40 minutes exposure (stacks of 80 x 30 second exposures) through each of the ZWO Ha, OIII, SII filters (7 nanometer band-pass) that pass those emission lines.
