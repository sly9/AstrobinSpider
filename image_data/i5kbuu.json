    "description": "After first imaging M31 in August of 2019 with no guiding, no coma correction, no filters, and DSLR; I've wanted to return to it with better gear. I have returned to it, but hoped for so much more. I decided to do a 4-panel mosaic, since the 1600 at 800mm crops out so much of the galaxy. I think this has turned out well. The problem has been the weather. Things were fine in the early fall, but the skies have been awful here since early November. I wanted to get so much more data, but time has run out.\r\n\r\nOh well... It will still be there next year for me.",
