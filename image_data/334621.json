    "description": "Never imagined I would be shooting broadband again in the city, but I just run out of narrowband targets after midnight this time of the year. Since I still had my setup out and ready, I thought ... why not?! The resulted image surprised me. It actually turned out way better than what I had anticipated given how my M81 & M82 image (taken last year from the same backyard when I just received my ASI1600mm) looks.\r\n\r\nAlso, my scope's focal length is rather short, definitely not ideal for these kinds of targets. Had to crop quite a bit to get this composition. I'm going to need to invest in a longer scope in the future if I want to get better details in these galaxies it looks like.",
