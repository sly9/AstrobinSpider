    "description": "One of my last images with my ASI 1600, this quite beautiful pair in Ursa Major. Spectacular through the eyepiece, too.  This one was captured from Fremont Peak, where seeing can get quite good during the spring and summer (as it was on this night).\r\n\r\nThere were some bad reflection artefacts from Merak, which is just offscreen to the bottom left. I had to process them out with some aggressive background flattening in PI Pixelmath. Luckily, this field was sparse (aside from the two Messiers themselves) and so was largely unaffected by the manipulation.",
