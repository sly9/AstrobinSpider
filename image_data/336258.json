    "description": "M65 and M66, a pair of interacting galaxies and a part of the Leo Triplet.   I'm happy about the detail I was able to get on these.  I'm a bit under-sampled with a .73 image scale and it's difficult to get below 2 a-s on my subs. \r\n\r\nLRGB composition cropped from a square frame.  Calibration in CCDStack, registration, integration and LRGB assembly in PI.  Photoshop unsharp masking was used to sharped at multiple scales.  A soft light layer was used between the color and luminance layers.  \r\n\r\n83 subs, L22, R23, G21, B18.  All 600 seconds.  Total of 13.9 hours.",
