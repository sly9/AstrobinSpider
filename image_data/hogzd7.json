    "description": "Abell 43 is an extremely faint planetary nebula, which is very rarely imaged. The nebula is a sphere of gas with an intricate lace-like network of tendrils. It is difficult to detect at all, and a challenge to image, even under dark skies. It is listed as having a magnitude of 14.7, but the light is spread out into ghostly wisps. \r\n\r\nOther designations include: PK 036+17.1,PN G036.0+17.6,IRAS 17511+1037\r\n\r\nAbell 43 is one of two pulsating ``hybrid-PG 1159'' stars. The other is HS 2324+3944. \r\nIt exhibits at least two periods of 2600 s and 3035 s, the longest ones observed up to now in PG 1159 and “hybrid-PG 1159” pulsators. This strongly suggests that the variations are due to non-radial g-mode pulsations and cannot be a consequence of binarity. This discovery raises puzzling questions regarding the excitation mechanism in this H rich, C and O poor “hybrid-PG 1159” since the C and O abundances are too low to trigger the instability through the κ-mechanism induced by the partial ionization of C and O, a mechanism invoked to explain the instability in the PG 1159 stars and in the previously known “hybrid-PG 1159” pulsator HS 2324+3944.",
