    "description": "The LRGB data was captured over consecutive nights from 23-27 March 2017 on a WO Star 71 (Mk I) and a Moravian G2-8300 with Bader Filters.  \r\n\r\nI had been gathering Ha data on a two-panel mosaic with my Esprit 120/QSI 690 combination.    These were 1800s subs which I began capturing back at the beginning of March and is ongoing.  This Ha mosaic was rescaled and aligned to the LRGB using Registar.  Although I have 5 hours on each panel, I have only 'counted' 5 hours towards the total integration time - I could not see any good reason to shoot 5 hours of Ha through the WO Star 71 when I already had the 'equivalent'.\r\n\r\nData capture was completed on 27 March, and this is the date posted.
