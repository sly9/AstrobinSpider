    "description": "The plan was , of course :) , to go after the faint double loop tidal stream. Little did I know that my filters were moving in my wheel and totally killed flats. so I had to basically abandon the project. The M51 was the backup target . I was still nursing hope that I may be able to recapture subs to get that elusive tidal stream (which I was starting to see a hint of.. at least a portion of it in extreme stretch - but once the flats failed, I gave up. That thing is incredibly faint!). I still will try to attempt it again but  our rain/clouds are still continuing, so I don't think it is going to   happen this year.\r\n\r\n\r\nL - 42x10 minutes\r\nR/G/B - 15x10 minutes each",
