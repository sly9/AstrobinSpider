    "description": "The Leo Triplet imaged from 5/8/2018 - 5/13/2018.\r\n\r\nNot the best data in the world but it's all I have been able to capture for some time now due to rain and clouds. On top of that, I discovered I had a bad case of camera tilt in the top left corner. Cropped out as much as possible and just went with it. Tried to make lemonade out of my lemons :-)\r\n\r\nImaged at a Gain of 75 and Offset of 15.",
