    "description": "This is my take on the Crescent Nebula (NGC 6888) in HOO. Actually this is a first for me with this palette and it took me a while to get to a satisfactory result. All in all I like that you get naturally looking colors/stars with this palette. I did not feel the need of actually replacing the stars with RGB ones.\r\n\r\nOf course I'm pretty happy that I was able to reveal the oxygen cocoon around the crescent nebula. Looks marvelous :)\r\n\r\nIt's actually pretty early in the year to shoot this target but it evaded me for almost 1.5 years now and I finally wanted to get a good shot at it :)",
