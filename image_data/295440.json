    "description": "DBW-111, aka Propeller Nebula and MRSL 497, is an emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus. The Propeller Nebula is part of a much larger nebular complex common in this area of the sky. Very little is known about this object. The Propeller Nebula is comprised mostly of Ha. There is some SII and very little OIII. Two years ago I did a narrower field of this object, using my 107mm triplet, in SHO tri-color. http://www.astrobin.com/206249/D/?image_list_page=3&nc=&nce=\r\n\r\nI still dont have narrowband filters for the Moravian G2-4000. With the moon nearing full I decided to mount the Star71 and SBIG camera/SX filter wheel piggyback on the RC and shoot some Ha data.\r\n\r\nRevision B is starless.",
