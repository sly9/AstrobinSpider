    "description": "NGC 6726 and NGC 6727 - These spectacular reflection nebulae located in the constellation Corona Australis are the result of a few bright stars wrapped in a large dusty cloud. The particular yellowish curved band near the two light-reflecting nebulae surrounds an intriguing object best seen in infrared light. It is R CrA, a young star still accreting interstellar material on its surface. These compact nebulae are ejected from the protostars during the later stages of star formation and sometimes appear in pairs, moving in opposite directions from the hidden star-forming region. The R CrA complex is about 500 light years away, one of the closest star-forming regions.\r\n\r\nA short period of clear sky in this early winter period in the southern hemisphere allowed a small achievement. However, we should soon find the return of beautiful nights in this region for new projects.",
