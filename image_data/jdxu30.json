    "description": "A fairly bright comet has moved into Coma Berenices and is skirting by 10th magnitude Galaxy NGC4414 ( ~55M ly away).  The Comet is fairly close to us at this moment, at about 0.7 AU away.  Perihelion was on March 1 of this year, never closer than 1 AU from the sun.  \n\nI'm not surprised about the color of the comet's atmosphere (Coma) being a typical Carbon rich greenish/blue in color.  It's the reddish brown tail color and structure that intrigues me.  Bright Comet C/2020 F3 NEOWISE displayed a similar reddish hue just after perihelion last year.  I wonder if sodium atoms are at play again?",
