    "description": "Here we have an image of a portion of the beautiful Blue Horsehead.  I was trying to find something to image at a longer focal length.  While browsing some of the latest images here on Astrobin, I came across some very nice examples of the Blue Horsehead.  I noticed this trio of stars and accompanying nebulae and thought, why not give it a try?  It is rather low at my location and transits at 37 degrees but still, why not?\r\n\r\nWhile doing the capture work on this, the temperatures really began to soar here in Arizona.  All except the L work was captured with temperatures of nearly 100f  (38c) so I had to do the work with the camera cooler set at 0c.  I was still quite pleased with the noise levels.\r\n\r\nI imaged this in LRGB and really liked the way it turned out but began to think that perhaps there was some molecular hydrogen in an area like this.  I then shot an evening of Ha to see if I could find any.  The result was that some appeared to be present throughout the image and I think it gave a little boost to the gas/dust area in the lower left quadrant of the image and the VdB101 nebula.  Also included a monochrome version for fun.\r\n\r\nAs always, comments/criticism welcome and I hope you like this one. Clear skies and good health.",
