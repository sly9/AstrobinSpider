    "description": "This is admittedly a rather drab object, however, I think most pure dark nebulae I would describe that way. Because of that though, I tried my best to \"spice\" it up a little by enhancing the multiple background galaxies along with giving the image some color in the form of the stars. Not my favorite image, but I feel as though I have done this target justice.",
