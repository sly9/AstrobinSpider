    "description": "This image was created in the past year by myself and 3 fellow astrophotographers, Sara Wager, Kees Scherer and Dominique Dierick. It's a mosaic of 8 panels that I started in 2016 and I'm slowly extending to cover more area. For every panel I try at least to get 5 hours of H-alpha data. Sara, Kees and Dominique were so nice to share their data on this region improving the quality of the image in many ways!\r\n\r\nThe mosaic was generated with the new Astropixelprocessor software which did a great job in processing and mosaicing this image.\r\n\r\nExposure info:\r\n\r\nAndre: \r\nTMB92/QSI583ws\r\n171x900s Ha\r\n\r\nSara:\r\nOrion Optics ODK10/TMB152/QSI683wsg \r\n146x1800s Ha\r\n\r\nKees:\r\nSkywatcher Esprit 100/QHY16200\r\n61x900s Ha\r\n\r\nDominique:\r\nTakahashi FSQ106/QHY163M\r\n36x300s Ha",
