    "description": "A beautiful target, apparently hard to observe visually. My neighbours had no success even with a 20\" dobsonian under a Bortle 2 sky. Photographically it is a very pleasing target. It was shot on La Palma during my holidays. It is an integration of 43x 360s subs, shot with my Canon EOS 600Da through a Pentax SDP 105. This is probably a target which can benefit quite well from Ha narrowband addition, maybe next time... :)\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJan",
