    "description": "Jupiter on Tue 25 Aug 2020 UTC.\r\n\r\nPhotographed King of the Planets for under an hour in good seeing conditions.  Cut the session short due to a series of ADC tests in preparation for Mars imaging after midnight.  This image is a combination of 10,215 best frames recorded between 10:14 and 10:31 pm Canberra time.\r\n\r\nGRS and Oval BA are passing each other and have just crossed the terminator.  New outbreak in the NEB is rising in the west.   Polar red spot S4-LRS-1 is also visible in high southern latitudes.",
