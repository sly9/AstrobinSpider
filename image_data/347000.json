    "description": "This one was fun as always. I tried to bring out the Oiii the best I could in this image, but it was just so darn sparse in the nebula that it made it difficult to make the blue really pop. Now I see why my friend Andrew was having issue with it! Regardless it was still fun and I even attempted to go with a minimalistic noise reduction approach to see how it would turn out. It's a bit noisier than I am used to and I don't think I will skip NR so much again, but it was still fun to experiment.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
