    "description": "Just a specific zoom of my east veil nebula which I like  :-)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nI had this project in mind for a long time : even the east part only of the Veil nebula are so vast , it really needs a wide field setup. With the new 24x26 CMOS, I thought it was a good time to have a try !\r\n\r\nSo I used my Newton 300mm F4 with the ZWO ASI6200.\r\nProject of 2 frame mosaic\r\n\r\nOIII nebula are finally more present than Ha, but you need a good filtering , the 3mm Chroma does a good job with that, the difference is impressive if you compare it with a larger band filter like a baader 8mm for example.\r\n\r\n124 Halpha subs @300s gain 100 and -15°C\r\n103 OIII subs @300s gain 100 and -15°C\r\n\r\n20 Blue subs @60s gain 100 and -15°C\r\n20 Green subs @60s gain 100 and -15°C\r\n20 Red subs @60s gain 100 and -15°C\r\n\r\nTotal exposure more than 20 hours",
