    "description": "This data is from 3 \"OneClick\" observations of the Running Chicken Nebula, from Telescope.Live's CHI-1.\n\n 6x300 sec for each NB filter.\n\nI guess one thing that's interesting about OneClick and Pro Datasets from Telescope.Live, is you can see what people do with the same data.\n\nGo here: https://telescope.live/gallery and search for \"chicken\" (note there will be wider fields, from Australia, as well as as the close in data from Chile).\n\nDifferent crops and orientations, different processing workflows, color schemes, etc.\n\nI can spot different Pi scripts now ;0)",
