    "description": "Reflection nebula NGC 1333. This was imaged from the \"Cosmic Campground\" in New Mexico and Alabaster Caverns State Park in Oklahoma. This was my first large multi-session (7 nights). I wasn't until I got home that I realized I imaged all of this with gain 139 instead of my planned gain 0. I Can't believe I never noticed. \r\n\r\nAlso, this was my first target where I used Astro Pixel Processor to do all my pre-processing workflow. I had just downloaded the trial, played with it a day or so then figured I'd give it a try for this multi-filter/multi-session collection. \r\n\r\nDid all my post-processing in PixInsight.",
