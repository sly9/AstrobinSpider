    "description": "Bad weather and fires in California, so here is another rework of an  image from last year with heavy emphasis on dim nebulosity. Notice how the tint of the dust clouds varies across the frame. At first I thought that this was some kind of artifact of processing or residual gradient. But no, these variations are also visible in other photographs of this area. I assume that the subtle color shifts are due to different fraction of reflected and scattered radiation inside the clouds. Not bad for a relatively short exposure.\r\nLum: 4.5h \r\nRGB: 1.25h each filter.",
