    "description": "Within the constellation Dorado, the nucleus of NGC 1672 is of the Seyfert type, bright and compact source of powerful electromagnetic radiation and it is interspersed with a region of star formation burst. Clusters of hot blue young stars form along these arms and ionize the surrounding clouds of hydrogen gas that glow red. Delicate curtains of dust partially obscure and redden the starlight behind them, diffusing a blue light.",
