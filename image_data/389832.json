    "description": "This interesting HII region was introduced to myself by my friend Luiz Duczmal, who recently imaged it with a wider field (https://www.astrobin.com/full/387336/0/).  GUM15, in the constellation of Vela is an active HII region  much less  known than its more famous sibling, the Trifid Nebula.  The hydrogen gas is ionized probably by the multiple star HD74804, a BIII/5 giant that appears off-center in the image together with its well resolved 3 components at lower left of the star (SIMBAD).\r\nThe post-processing of the image after calibration and registration was skillfully done by my friend Roberto Colombari,  whose collaboration in this work I thank very much.",
