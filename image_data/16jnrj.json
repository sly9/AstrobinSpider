    "description": "Betelgeuse , although one brightest luminaries of the sky, garnered additional attention in 2020 with its fainting episode. So what happens when you take a widefield deep image of one of the most famous stars in the sky? You get this result. Not often appreciated is that environs of bright stars may have interesting backgrounds.  Few people would spend 4.5 hours of observing time staring at Betelgeuse.... and existing survey images of the sky do not hint at the result because typically the bright star overwhelms the field of view. So, take a risk, be bold!",
