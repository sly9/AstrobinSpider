    "description": "This one was tricky to process.  I tried making a synthetic green channel for the first time, and it worked out *ok*, but it took me forever to get the colors to an acceptable place, and even now, I may still tweak it some more, but I thought this was a nice pastel palette as a change from the traditional Hubble palette I so often use.  There's quite a bit more detail to be had in the core and in the surrounding Oiii envelope, and perhaps more integration time will bring it out.",
