    "description": "This is my first \"telescopic\" astrophoto from the amazing Namibia, where the sky is excellent quality. However the transparency is totally 10/10, the seeing sometimes are very average, bequase the cold depressions are always invisibly moving through the savanna. Only the stars blinking \"alert\" us the bad seeing conditions. \r\n\r\nBad seeing or good seeing. It was a good life experience. :-)",
