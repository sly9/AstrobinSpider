    "description": "Here we have a view of some of the most fascinating terrain on the Moon.  I think if someone asked me which crater on the Moon was my favorite, I would probably say it is Clavius.  I love the ramparts, the smooth basaltic floor and the multitude of tiny craters.  But I really like the visual harmony created by the five larger craters contained within Clavius that form a sort of spiral arc with each crater diminishing in size.  \r\n\r\nI had been having collimation issues with the C9.25 ever since I converted it back to its normal configuration from the HyperStar configuration.  So last night I dug in and was determined to get it right.  Then one of those great moments came while I was working on the collimattion where like magic, it \"snapped\" into focus.  I was quite pleased and l noticed the Moon was in a very favorable position almost directly overhead and some presumably very good seeing.  \r\n\r\nI captured this image as more of a test than anything else and when I processed it, I was very pleased indeed.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it and any comments/critcism are always welcome.\r\n\r\nCS and good health.",
