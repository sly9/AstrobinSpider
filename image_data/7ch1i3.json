    "description": "SH2-115 is a well structured emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus. It mainly features Ha colors. In his neigborhood (top right of the frame) we find the Object Abell 71. Abell 71 is still discussed to be a planetary nebula or just an Ha emission nebula.\r\n\r\nThe image was shot in a short gap between a thunderstorm and twilight, Therefore the image has gathered just about 2.8 hrs of light.\r\n\r\n25 x 200s Ha Baader 7.5 nm at gain 76\r\n25 x 200s OIII Chroma 3nm at gain 76\r\n\r\nASI1600mmp and TS 130/910 mm apo with 0.79 x reducer.",
