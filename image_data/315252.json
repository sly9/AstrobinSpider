    "description": "Messier 78 is definitely one of the most beautiful deep sky objects. It truly deserves the queen of reflection nebulas title. What we see, is clusters of newly born young stars and interstellar dust, as it orders by the star's gravity and forces of stellar wind. This composition greatly shows the contrast of star formation, as it violently whirls enormous amount of dust and gas, like ancient demons fight while actually new star systems, new cosmic life is being born.\r\n\r\nThe image was made by stacking 189 five minutes sub expos which were acquired during 7 nights at 3 different location.",
