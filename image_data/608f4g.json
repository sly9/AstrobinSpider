    "description": "NGC 4236 is a barred spiral galaxy in Draco. It is 11.8 mLy distant. Despite it being quite large and having an apparent magnitude of 10, it has a low surface brightness (24 mag/arc-sec2) and so is quite difficult to observe and image. It is a member of the M81 group of galaxies, but is considerably dimmer than the more prominent members.\r\n\r\nImaging Camera: QSI640wsg\r\nImaging Scope: Celestron 9.25\"Edge HD at f/7\r\nGuide Camera: SX Lodestarx2\r\nMount: Avalon M-Uno Fast Reverse\r\nFilters: Astrodon Gen II LRGB\r\nExposure: 6 hours Lum, 5 minute subs unbinned, 2 hour each RGB, 2.5 minute subs binnedx2\r\nCapture: APT\r\nProcessing: CCD Stack and PS CC\r\nDate: 4/6/21-4/8/21\r\nSky conditions: below average seeing, bortle white skies, SQM 17.8mag/arc-sec2\r\nLocation: My front driveway.
