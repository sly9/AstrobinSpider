    "description": "Drove to Madras, OR to witness & photograph my first Total Solar Eclipse (ever)! It was the most incredible sight. Every so often I go back to this image I captured so I can reminisce those fleeting moments of absolute darkness. This image was captured using a Stellarvue SVR102T f/7 refractor with a 2x Focal Extender and a Canon 5D Mark IV. The Earthshine, Solar Corona & Prominences were captured at different exposures and combined in Photoshop using a mean HDR technique I learned on YouTube.\r\n\r\nSix exposures were stacked together using a \"Mean\" function, then a relatively longer exposure image that showed the Earth Shine on the Moon's surface was added in to form this final image. The \"Mean\" mode of stacking gives good results on HDR images, but the downside is that very dark parts of the image loose surface detail, because of which the Earth Shine needed to be added in afterwards.",
