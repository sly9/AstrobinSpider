    "description": "NGC 6188 is an emission nebula located about 4,000 light years away in the constellation Ara. The bright open cluster NGC 6193, visible to the naked eye, is responsible for a region of reflection nebulosity within NGC 6188.\r\n\r\nNGC 6188 is a star forming nebula, and is sculpted by the massive, young stars that have recently formed there â€“ some are only a few million years old. This spark of formation was probably caused when the last batch of stars went supernova. (Wikipedia). Also, this nebula has been nicknamed \"the fighting dragons nebula\" by many amateur astrophotographers, because of the shapes of the darker parts of the nebula.\r\n\r\nThis particular image is composed using narrowband data obtained using HAlpha, OIII and SII filters.",
