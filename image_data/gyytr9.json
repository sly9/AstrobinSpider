    "description": "Hey Kids! Here's todays Prom animation. Conditions were sketchy because they kept changing. I took 285 videos (staked into frames) and ended up with 200 @ 30fps. If things are really smooth I usually use 20fps. As I said, it was intermittently hazy which accounts for the uneven brightness, a shame because this was a pretty big prom for this 'minimum' period. Enjoy!",
