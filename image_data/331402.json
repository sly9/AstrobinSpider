    "description": "Here we have a look at the Soul Nebula in this two-pane mosaic from my test data @ITU.\r\nThe Soul Nebula is big, relatively bright and has some nice detail but despite my best efforts, it has been my nemesis, no matter what I tried I could not process a decent version.  So in an attempt to rectify that here is my latest offering, its also nice to see just how far I have come in a little over 3 years, looking back at my earlier (hideous) version https://www.astrobin.com/137298/B/?image_list_page=5&nc=&nce= it demonstrates where a little hard work can take you :)\r\nHope you enjoy.",
