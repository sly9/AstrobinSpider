    "description": "Happy new year everyone :)\r\n\r\nAfter a chaotic last year I thought I'd share with you my rendition of vdb 152. After spending about 24h of exposure time on it I admit it sat on my hard drive for quite a while, as did quite a few other raw images. I think I had some trouble with my own ambitions after seeing so many awe inspiring images on here that I didn't consider many to be good enough to be released. I hope I managed to reconsile this and will continue sharing.\r\n\r\nI have to say that processing this image is quite challenging given my light polluted location. But with a little bit of downsampling at the end I am happy with it now. I hope you enjoy looking at it.",
