    "description": "Hey Kids! Well we finally got some clear weather, although the lowness of the Sun made it challenging to shoot. That and the turbulence. But it is what it is. I was going to do a Prom animation but the conditions weren't right. So I shot the current surface activity and it just so happened that there was a Prom in the field of view. So I shot both of them and combined them. Enjoy!",
