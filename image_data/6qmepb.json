    "description": "The Bubble nebula is also a well known object, unlike many images here on Astrobin that home in on the Bubble with longer focal length, using 8in f4 will produce more a wide field.\r\n\r\nAs usual it is a starless work flow on the Ha, OIII and SII channels that were merged using modified Hubble palette. 14h exposure time went into the narrow band. For the first time I also tried adding a synthetic luminance channel (max(Ha,O3,S2) to the NB RGB. The resulting image was then merged with the RGB stars (another 2h exposure).\r\n\r\n35x60s je RGB\r\n46x300s Ha\r\n70x300s O3\r\n56x300s S2\r\n\r\n19.-22.6.",
