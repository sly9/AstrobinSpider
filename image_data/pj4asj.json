    "description": "NGC 3324 is an open cluster in the southern constellation Carina, located northwest of the Carina Nebula at a distance of around 7,560 light-years away from Earth. \r\n\r\nIt is closely associated with the emission nebula IC 2599, also known as Gum 31.\r\n\r\nThe two are often confused as a single object, and together have been nicknamed the \"Gabriela Mistral Nebula\" due to their resemblance to the Chilean poet.\r\n\r\nIf you look closely, you may be able to make out the 'face' in this image.\r\n\r\nCaptured using the Telescope Live CHI-1 astrograph located at the El Sauce Observatory in the Rio Hurtado Valley in Chile, South America.",
