    "description": "Situated approximately 70 million light years away in Libra, ARP 261 consisting of PGC 52935 and PGC 52940) is a pair of interacting galaxies in a highly disruptive state. The interaction has created tremendous distortion in both galaxies as well as tangental star streams. ARP 261 has an apparent size of only 1.5 x 0.9' as is rarely imaged. This image was upsized 125 % using ON1 Resize\r\nImaged in LRGB on our Planewave CDK 1000 at El Sauce, Obstech, Chile\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\r\nSystem Control: Voyager by Leo Orazi",
