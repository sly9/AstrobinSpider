    "description": "Sh2-264, \"The Angelfish Nebula\"  from Wiki:\r\n\r\nSharpless 264, also known as the Lambda Orionis Ring, is a molecular cloud and H II region, which can be seen in the northern region of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex (OMCC), in the constellation of Orion. The OMCC is one of the best-known star formation regions and the closest sector of the Milky Way to our Solar System where high-mass stars are born. The nebula is named after its main star, Î» Orionis, a blue giant responsible for the ionization of the surrounding material. \r\n It is also sometimes called the Angelfish Nebula due to its resemblance to an angelfish.",
