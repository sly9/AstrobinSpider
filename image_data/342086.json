    "description": "This object is catalogued as Mandel-Wilson 2, and known colloquially as the Angel Nebula.  It is made up of Integrated Flux Nebula (IFN).  According to Steve Mandel-Wilson, IFN are \"high galactic latitude nebulae ... illuminated not by a single star (as most nebula in the plane of the Galaxy are) but by the energy from the integrated flux of all the stars in the Milky Way\".  And who am I to argue?  \r\n\r\nData for this were captured between 23 February and 17 April 2018 from a remote imaging facility located in Extremadura in Spain (e-EyE).  The rig is jointly owned and managed with Barry Wilson.\r\n\r\nLum: 93 x 600s\r\nRed: 32 x 600s\r\nGreen: 32 x 600s\r\nBlue: 32 x 600s\r\n\r\nThat makes 31.5 hours of exposure time.\r\n\r\nData Capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
