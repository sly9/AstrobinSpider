    "description": "\r\nThis crater could be a beautiful test for a telescope's optics.\r\nBecause its floor is dark, the crater in its interior are difficult to highlight, both visually and in photographs. For this we need a quiet night, with good seeing, tele well collimated, acclimated and mainly observe with the Moon in good altitude to avoid the fluctuation of the image.\r\nNormally these craterelets can be seen with openings from 200mm but the angle of solar illumination is also very important.\r\nThis undoubtedly is one of the most striking craters of the lunar surface, its superb size, its terrace walls with numerous crumbling regions and especially its privileged location facilitate its observation and make it one of the great targets for who enters the lunar observation.",
