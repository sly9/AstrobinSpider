    "description": "Hello everyone, this is my first narrow band image, processed in the Hubble palette.\r\nOne hour (12x5min) with each filter, in total 180min. \r\nA novelty for me, since until now I had only done LRGB.\r\n I really appreciate any suggestions to improve the photo and learn more about narrow band. Thank you.\r\nHealth and take care of yourself.",
