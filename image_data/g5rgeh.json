    "description": "The Sombrero Galaxy (also called M104 or NGC 4594) is an iconic galaxy as the version produced by Hubble has marked the minds of astronomers around the world.\r\nThis spiral galaxy, seen from the side, has the particularity of having a symmetrical band of dust around its bulb, hence its name.\r\nUnfortunately, my equipment does not allow me to image it satisfactorily so I took the opportunity to process the data made available by the scientists. What a joy to work on such an extraordinary image!\r\n\r\nSource data: Hubble Legacy Archive\r\nProcessing: Sabine Gloaguen (AstroPixelProcessor + Photoshop)\r\nRGB image\r\nMosaic of 6 tiles\r\n\r\nClick on the link below to access the zoomable version in high definition:\r\nhttps://sabinegloaguen.prodibi.com/a/1jeeoyr0oq6moer/i/4y0jogdgxmqodwk",
