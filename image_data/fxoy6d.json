    "description": "For the August dark cycle, I decided to switch from galaxies to the plentiful reflection nebula that work well with LRGB and my FOV.\r\n\r\nI was aiming for my usual 15 hours, but a sudden storm limited me to just 2 hours L and 2 hours in each RGB channel (8 hours total). This was my second and last object for this August. Still working #1. (-:\r\n\r\nFortunately FWHM was under 2\" on the few 15-minute L subs, so nothing was wasted. \"The calm before the storm\" I suppose.\r\n\r\nPI HDR is key to unlocking the bright center. Color should be fairly accurate with PI > PCC using an Average Spiral Galaxy reference.\r\n\r\nDown to Earth, this reminds me of our sun peaking through our clouds.\r\n\r\nComments are always appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"These cosmic clouds have blossomed 1,300 light-years away, in the fertile starfields of the constellation Cepheus. Called the Iris Nebula, NGC 7023 is not the only nebula to evoke the imagery of flowers. Still, this image shows off the Iris Nebula's range of colors and symmetries, embedded in surrounding fields of interstellar dust. Within the Iris itself, dusty nebular material surrounds a hot, young star. The dominant color of the brighter reflection nebula is blue, characteristic of dust grains reflecting starlight. Central filaments of the reflection nebula glow with a faint reddish photoluminesence as some dust grains effectively convert the star's invisible ultraviolet radiation to visible red light. The pretty blue petals of the Iris Nebula span about six light-years.\"",
