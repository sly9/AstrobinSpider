    "description": "My attempt at following Fabian Neyer in looking for Ha signal around the Double Cluster. The widefield is from Tak FSQ106N/Atik 11000, HaLRGB. 11 hours of Ha. The central clusters have been enhanced by blending in earlier LRGB data from our TEC140/Atik 11000 and Atik 4000. Mesu 200 mount.  The Ha needed brutal processing which always left me worried that I might have created some of the background myself. I've just checked it against an image on the MDW sky survey website and found a high degree of agreement with thier results, so here it is. All captures from Les Granges in SE France.",
