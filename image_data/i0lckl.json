    "description": "This picture shows the faint reflection nebula in the universe. This area is between the constellation of the great bear and the constellation of the little bear. This picture was taken by my telescope in Xinjiang remote Observatory in early 2019. The total exposure time is about 150 hours. These faint nebulae are seen by us because they reflect the light of the surrounding stars, so the spectrum of the reflection nebula is continuous as that of the stars, and the color it presents is closely related to the color of the reflected stars. In addition, some faint reflection nebulae can be captured by ultra long time exposure. They are called integrated flux nebula, IFN. They reflect weak light by a large number of dim stars in the galaxy. So these nebulae tend to be dark red or brown yellow.",
