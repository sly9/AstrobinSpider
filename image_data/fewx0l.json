    "description": "This was an object that was partially captured with the ASI 1600mm when I got the ASI 294mm so I was able to get some exposures with both. They combined nicely and was able to get some detail in the fainter bits. Overally happy but may get some more exposure when the object is high in the sky again.\r\n\r\nGain 200 images are from the ASI1600mm and gain 120 are from the ASI 294mm\r\n\r\nCaptured over 18 nights from 11/4/2020 to 1/1/2021.",
