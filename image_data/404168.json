    "description": "Here I present an image of Messier 5 (NGC 5904), a globular cluster in Serpens.  M5 is located approximately 24,500 light years away and contains somewhere between 100,000 and 500,000 stars.  It has a diameter of approximately 165 light years.\r\n\r\nIt is unusual in that there have been a number of variable stars discovered within this cluster. \r\n\r\nThe foregoing information is paraphrased from the Wikipedia entry about this subject.\r\n\r\nI wanted to shoot this one using a OSC and compare the results to that which I obtained using a monochrome camera and RGB filters on Messier 3.  I believe the monochrome camera delivers much better stars.\r\n\r\nAlso, in this image I used some different NR techniques suggested to me by Fritz that I think work a little better than what I've used before, particularly in preserving small details.\r\n\r\nComments and criticism always welcome...\r\nCS,\r\nMike",
