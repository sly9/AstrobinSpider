    "description": "Messier 82 (NGC 3034) – the Cigar Galaxy - is approximately 12 million light years away in the constellation of Ursa Major.  It was first observed by Johann Elert Bode on 31 December 1774.  \r\n\r\nThe core of M82 is an area of intense star formation, considered to be a result of gravitational interaction with nearby Messier 81.  Radiating out from the core of M82 are streams of gas that are especially striking in Ha.  These wisps extend out some 34,000 light years from the core - the galaxy is 42,000 light years long.  (Information adapted from: O’Meara, SJ, The Messier Objects: Second Edition: Cambridge University Press – 2014.)\r\n\r\nUPDATE (thanks to Sigga – see her comments below): To the left and slightly above the galaxy there is a small arc of nebulosity visible in the Ha data. This has been dubbed ‘the cap’ - it consists of galactic halo material that has been ionized by the superwind shock or intense ultraviolet radiation from the young, massive stars in the galaxy's core (APOD). This ‘cap’ is around 35,000 light-years from the galaxy.\r\n\r\nMessier 82 was imaged between 31 December 2018 and 14 January 2019 from a remote imaging rig in Spain owned and operated by Barry Wilson and Steve Milne.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon NB 3nm\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 24 x 1200s\r\nLum: 48 x 600s\r\nRed: 24 x 600s\r\nGreen: 24 x 600s\r\nBlue: 24 x 600s\r\n\r\nA total of 28 hours exposure.\r\n\r\nData capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
