    "description": "First light of  my Star Adventura EQ tracker and a Nikon D750. I used a Nikon 50mm f1.4 stopped down to F3.5 for wide field sharpness.  With the help of my Polemaster, good polar alignment was quickly achieved. \r\nI wasnt prepared for how good the tracking was on this little EQ gem.  I knocked out 12 frames without darks or lights and stacked them in Sequator, a new and very fast and easy 64bit stacking program which has far less gremlins than DSS.\r\nAlso surprising was the D750. In its unmodified form, it pulls out a decent amount of Ha.\r\nI am very happy with this  dramatic and pleasing result .",
