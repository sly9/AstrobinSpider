    "description": "This is the first time I'm editing not my own captured data, but data from an amateur hosting facility; in this case it is the El Sauce Observatory in Chile with a Telescope hosted by telescope.live.\r\n\r\nTelescope.live asked me to join their team and represent them as ambassador. As I get full access to their data sets I think it is only fair to try my luck on some of their Pro data sets myself :D \r\n\r\nOf course I chose an object in the southern hemisphere that I'm likely never be able to capture with my gear. As I normally target projects with a minimum 20 hours of intergration time I was very surprised about the quality their f/3 telescope could capture from Chile skies with just a total of 2,5 hours.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my version of the Running Chicken Nebula, but where is the Chicken?",
