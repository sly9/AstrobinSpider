    "description": "I used Canon 6D 20-megapixel digital camera, with a 1.4x\r\nteleconverter and a Canon 500 mm f/4 telephoto lens on a fixed tripod. Exposures: 7 frames at 1/8\r\nsecond, 3 frames at 1/25th second, 5 frames at 1/80 second, and 2 frames at 1/250 second, all at f/11,\r\nISO 200. The multiple frames at the same exposure were aligned and stacked with sigma-clipped average\r\nand saved as 32-bit floating point images. Then each stacked image had a radial blur applied and 75%\r\nof the blur subtracted to enhance detail. Color corrections were made at each step to show the colors\r\nthat came out of the camera. The radial blur was then applied again at 41% subtraction, and then a\r\nthird time, and each step the intensity increased with the curves tool. Finally, Adaptive\r\nRichardson-Lucy deconvolution was applied to recover fine detail. The multiple processing steps also\r\nenhanced the color saturation. The different exposures were assembled and levels adjusted to give a\r\nconsistent flow from bright inner to the faint outer corona. Full plate scale was 1.94\r\narc-seconds/pixel. The image is reproduced here at 4.8 arc-seconds/pixel.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.clarkvision.com/galleries/gallery.eclipse/web/solar-eclipse-total-700mm-6d.c08.21.2017.IMG_0357-79c-detail2.b-c1-0.4xs.html",
