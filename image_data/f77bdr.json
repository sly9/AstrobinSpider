    "description": "I am a little late to the party, but this is my take on the comet. I was planning to do an HDR image and had also taken subs of 1s, 5s, and 60s. In the end, I just used 12 x 60s subs each of R, G, B.\r\nI still tried to tease out an HDR like appearance through some generous application of HDRMT and LHE in PixInsight. The end-result is closer to art than science, as is often the case in astrophotography.",
