    "description": "Here we have Abell 2151 also known as The Hercules Cluster. This is an interesting agglomeration of as many as 200 galaxies located about 500 million light years away.  This is part of the Hercules Super Cluster which is a part of the Great Wall Super Structure. \r\n\r\nThese are truly amazing if one considers how much there is in the 0.8 degree FOV.  This one is also of interest because it contains no giant elliptical galaxies which are generally present in cluster like this. But it does contain a lot of varying galaxy types and a lot of interacting galaxies.  One can even see a pair that looks quite similar to the Butterfly Galaxies or Siamese Twins.  \r\n\r\nI did this work under a bright moon and as a consequence, I did have to work with some pretty strong gradients.  But I am somewhat pleased with the outcome.\r\n\r\nThis project will likely mark the end of galaxy season for me,\r\n\r\nI hope you like it... clear skies!!",
