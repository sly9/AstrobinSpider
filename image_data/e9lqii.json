This galaxy, lying at a distance of ~12M light-years, is the nearest active-core galaxy (actively generating a plethora of new stars). It is called a “star-burst” galaxy and is an active radio-wave, X-ray, and gamma-ray emitter with a super-massive black hole at its center. Jets of aged stars and dust, streaming outward above and below the galactic plane, reach speeds approaching 50% the speed of light! Modeling suggests that the shape of this peculiar galaxy resulted from a collision and merging of a large elliptical galaxy with a smaller spiral galaxy**.\r\n (Source: largely Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nThese Images: I usually do not drizzle images, but the seeing was so good, σ ~ 0.6 arcsec, that I tried it, and it payed off! The hurdle was the noise. I used the artificial intelligence program Denoise AI to cure that quickly and completely (see my video: https://vimeo.com/399468940). \r\n\r\nSo I made two images:\r\n1) a full galaxy view (down-sampled 2x) -\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/2ej3aiyv9x4iiog/NGC5128_TAO150_DSW halfRes 80.jpg?dl=0\r\n 2) a focus on the dust lane -\r\n https://www.dropbox.com/s/t9qvq5gtrvtwaju/NGC5128DistLane_TAO150_DSW.jpg?dl=0\r\n  \r\nI've also attached two thumbnails, but, really, take a look at the links above, and do it at full screen!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, sharing the images is problematic because of their high resolution. If anyone has a better idea the DropBox, please let me know.\r\n*SWT (Subframe Weighting Tool) is an Excel Spreadsheet I developed for assigning weights to subframes based on user-selected image attributes and relative weights. SWT is available upon request: Alex(-at-)awkml.com.\r\n**Many details can be perused in Internal Kinematics and Dynamics of Galaxies (p.334).",
