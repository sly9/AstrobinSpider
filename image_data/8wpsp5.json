    "description": "Messier 99 is a so-called grand design spiral, with long, large and clearly defined spiral arms — giving it a structure somewhat similar to the Milky Way. This Hubble image, combining visible, infrared and ultraviolet observations, shows a detailed view of the galaxy M99. This galaxy is called a grand-design spiral, with long, large and clearly defined spiral arms — giving it a structure somewhat similar to our home galaxy, the Milky Way. \r\n\r\nLying around 50 million light-years away, Messier 99 is one of over a thousand galaxies that make up the Virgo Cluster, the closest cluster of galaxies to us. Messier 99 itself is relatively bright and large, meaning it was one of the first galaxies to be discovered, way back in the 18th century. This earned it a place in Charles Messier’s famous catalogue of astronomical objects.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the galaxy on the right side looks like it was cut by a straight line - it's not an artifact, it looks the same on other images of this galaxy taken by Earth based telescopes. It could be interesting to find an explanation to this phenomena. Could it be obscured by a a dust cloud or is a result of natural galaxy evolution?\r\n\r\nImage credits: ESA/Hubble & NASA, Janice Lee\r\nProcessing & copyright: Leo Shatz\r\n\r\nAn update: this image has been selected as the <a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210624.html\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Astronomy Picture of the Day - Messier 99</a>\r\n\r\nText source and credits: ESA/Hubble\r\n<a href=\"https://esahubble.org/images/potw1223a/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">esahubble.org/images/potw1223a/</a>",
