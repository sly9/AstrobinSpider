    "description": "This is a seagull  with two mosaics. It may be because the shooting time between the two pictures is long, which is nearly more than a month away. Therefore, due to some reasons, such as clouds or bad weather, the overall colors of the two pictures are quite different. After doing it several times, it was found that if preprocessing was done first and then mosaic was done with Photoshop, the two pictures could not be unified in hue and star color in the later stage. Later, I studied the mosaic processing directly with pixinsight, and then solved the overall color balance problem.",
