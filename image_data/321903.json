    "description": "My goal usually is to have 32 subs per channel or more.  But I tend to test stack as I collect data to verify that I'm getting what I want, tweak my next night's capture plan, and enjoy seeing early results!  With this one I haven't gotten any SII yet and I'm short on OIII.  But I want to try out some techniques I'm learning with Adam Blocks tutorial so I went ahead and did a pretty much full process.\r\n\r\nWell I liked it so here it is!\r\n\r\n27 Ha and 22 OIII all 20 minute subs.  The OIII is pretty noisy so I blurred it a bit and relied on the Ha to bring the detail.   I finally learned how to do a mask in PS and this has a few layers of unsharp masking at different scales.  The subs were calibrated and combined in CCDStack and post processing done in PS.  I did use Pixinsight for gradient removal, which is invaluable.  I apply noise reduction in PS using Topax de-noise.  Maybe a little heavy handed there....",
