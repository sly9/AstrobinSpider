    "description": "The Cygnus Wall is located in the southern part of NGC7000 - The North America Nebula.  It is one of the highest concentrations of star formations in the region and is located approximately 1,500 light years from Earth at a declination of 43° 32’.\r\n\r\nThis is the second time I have imaged the Cygnus Wall.  The first time was within 6 months of starting with astrophotography and I (obviously) made lots of mistakes.  I always wanted to return to this object and give it another go.  This week, with new equipment and a full moon to the south, I decided this was the time.\r\n\r\nAs always, I appreciate your comments and criticisms.",
