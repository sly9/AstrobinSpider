    "description": "The complete winter milky way, which is the outer region of our home galaxy and therefore not very prominent to the naked eye, especially in suburban areas. \r\nAt a very dark site - here at Emberger Alm in Austria, roughly 1800mtrs  above sea level, I managed to take this panorama of the complete winter milky way bow. \r\nThis is a very seldomly imaged object, compared to hundreds of summer milky way bows, containing the bright and prominent galactic core, that can be found around the web.  \r\nCompared to the latter, this  is a hard target to capture, especially with the dark dust lanes.\r\nThis panorama is composed of 15 panels in two rows, 7 for the bottom row and 8 for the top row to give a bit of headroom for perspective correction of the sky.\r\n\r\nData for each panel:\r\n\r\nPentax KP\r\nSamyang 10mm f/2.8\r\nf/2.8\r\n25sec\r\nISO 5000",
