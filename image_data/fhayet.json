    "description": "Wolf-Rayet 134 (WR 134) is a variable Wolf-Rayet star located around 6,000 light years away from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus, surrounded by a faint bubble nebula blown by the intense radiation and fast wind from the star.\r\nIn my image, the Wolf-Rayet star WR 134 is visible in the center of the gas bubble as the brightest white star.\r\nWolf-Rayet stars are extremely hot, bright, massive stars, and one of the rarest classes of stars known. As of 2018, only 154 had been identified in the Milky Way. Some produce spectacular nebula, e.g. the Crescent nebula (NGC 6888), thanks to their strong stellar winds, intense ultraviolet emissions, and clouds of gasses that they shed in earlier stages of their relatively brief lives.\r\nWolf-Rayet nebula around the Wolf-Rayet star WR 134 was first noticed in 1971. The nebula is embedded in the large nebula complex of Sh2-109, so the surrounding area is also filled with lots of emission nebulosity.\r\n\r\nThis image taken over several nights in October 2020.",
