    "description": "Nearly a month ago now I purchased my first ever, full proper Astrohphotography setup. And for this past month I haven't been able to use it. After many hours of troubleshooting and figuring out problems, bad weather and anything and everything going wrong, I have finally figured it all out!\r\n\r\nThis image was taken last night after a very quick setup that only took 10 minutes to my surprise. I had never even mounted my camera on the new scope until last night so everything was going pretty good!\r\n\r\nThis is only a very short 15 minutes worth of exposure, and the place I set everything up is in my frontyard, next to all the street lights (Yuck). I only did 15 minutes worth because I was so excited that I got everything working that I wanted to image everything in that sky that I could. I even forgot to take Dark (And other) frames as I wasn't intending on uploading this. But after the processing I was very happy with how much came out after such a very tiny amount of exposure.\r\n\r\nNext time the weather is clear I will actually put some time into my exposures and get better than this!\r\n\r\nP.s Coma corrector is needed! And I want to thank those of who helped me out significantly in the AB forums when I asked for mount and scope recommendations!",
