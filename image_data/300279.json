    "description": "This is not an impressionist painting made on Earth rather somehow God in the heavens seems to have his own thoughts of amazing colour so vividly vast it simply cannot be understood. This nebulous region is rich in Carbon chemistry and massive dust fields that are intense and illuminated by nearby stars and only 440 light years away. Some of these stars are very young hidden behind dark mysterious clouds. No other picture I have taken has so many colours in the one screen. If you look carefully it seems the middle section looks like a face sleeping peacefully on its side. Whose face, only God can tell us that one day.",
