    "description": "This was made using the narrowband data acquired on the target. Decided to get a little creative with the color and ended up making an OHH image rather than a classic SHO. There was technically Sii data collected, but the signal was so weak I decided to skip it entirely. I also opted for a color palette like this since classic SHO or HOO is so close to what it looks like in RGB, why even make separate images at that point? \r\n\r\nEnded up using the L again for detail, but also added in the RGB stars. \r\n\r\nOverall, not quite sure which version I like more. Personally, I think the RGB most likely just because it's a classic. While this was a blast to make, and also has some mad 【﻿ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ】 going on, the RGB will always be my favorite for this target. \r\n\r\nＣｌｅａｒ　ｓｋｉｅｓ，　ａｎｄ　ｔｈａｎｋｓ　ｆｏｒ　ｌｏｏｋｉｎｇ　永意畏ド因花",
