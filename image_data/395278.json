    "description": "Images from the following two scopes (piggybacked) contributed to this image:\r\nAG12+ASI1600MM at .70 asec/pix\r\nTV127is+ASI183MM at .75 asec/pix. \r\nThey were all registered to the best Ha image taken on the AG12.\r\n\r\nImaged on nights of 9/23/2018, 9/27/2018, 9/28/2018, 9/29/2018, 11/5/2018, 11/6/2018, 11/7/2018, 11/17/2018.\r\n\r\nSharpless 2-200, also known as HDW 2 (Hartl-Dengl-Weinberger 2), commonly called the \"Bearclaw nebula\", is a quite old planetary nebula (PN) in the constellation Cassiopeia.\r\nAccording to W. A. Weidmann and R. Gamen, who have examined the central stars of different PNs, the central star of HDW 2 is a binary star.\r\nThis is a very faint PN and requires a lot of imaging time to bring out any detail.",
