    "description": "Arguably one of my best images to date was the Orion Nebula from the Connecticut Star Party last year, however it was a tight fit in my 115mm APO and consisted of only 1/2 hour of data. This year I have a wider field refractor available (minus the dark skies of Goshen) and, after a botched focus that cost me a full night, I was able to give it more exposure time.\r\n\r\nI tried a different processing workflow here that left a somewhat mottled background, but I was happy to pull out much of the surrounding dark nebula (not easy this close to New York City). A second group of very short exposures was added to hold detail around the Trapezium.",
