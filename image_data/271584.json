    "description": "I have just acquired a new (used) telescope. A Skywatcher Evostar 80ED DS-Pro and I have decided to step up my image processing a notch and have had my first try with PixInsight 1.8.\r\n7+ hours of data over 4 nights with good conditions and a lot of learning have resulted what I would call my first WOW! image. Feeling very proud of this one.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to comment etc.",
