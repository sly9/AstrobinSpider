    "description": "Classic face-on galaxy at 27MLY in UMa and twice the size of the Milky Way, it has a low surface brightness and is quite asymmetric. It probably underwent a major collision to cause its strong asymmetry. It has a large number of HII regions with hot young stars.\r\n\r\n12.3 hr HaLRGB imaged at D.A.R.C.
