    "description": "Winding through space is Barnard 72  - a dense interstellar cloud of dust and gas silhouetted in the shape of a snake by a vast expanse of stars.B72 is a dark nebula in the Ophiuchus constellation where there are a number of similar dark nebulae lurking. The only way to see these types of nebulae is when they obscure the light behind them and stand out in the foreground. With the blue star 44 Ophiuchi shining brightly from the top left, this is one of my favorite scenes I've had the pleasure of capturing so far.",
