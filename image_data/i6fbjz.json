    "description": "SH2 280 is a diffuse nebula located in the constellation of Monoceros just south of the well known Rosette Nebula.\r\nIt is an Emission Nebula consisting of a mix of Hydrogen Alpha and Oxygen III gases. The nebula is illuminated and ionized by the HD 46573 a bright type O7 star which is located near the center of Sh2-280. A feature I find interesting  is the blue shock wave visible around the star.\r\nImaged  in SHO Hubble Palette at Obstech, Chile\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\r\nSystem Control Software: Voyager by Leo Orazi\r\nRiDK 400 Team: Mike Selby, Leo Orazi, John Kasianowicz, Rick stevenson, Josh Balsam and Scott Johnson",
