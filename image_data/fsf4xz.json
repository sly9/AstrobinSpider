    "description": "Hi everybody how are you? Hope you are great! Here is a Lagoon Nebula postprocessing attempt kindly acquired and shared by Kevin Morefield! Really nice SHO data! Thanks a lot Kevin...hope you enjoyed this try! Miss you all good friends... I have a lot of images to see in my Inbox yet, more than 3000â€¦but for sure Ill see one by one! Warm Regards!\r\n\r\nMy AP life resumee  ðŸ˜„:\r\n\r\nI have poor gear, even worse sky, Bortle 100 light pollution, zero PI PS course, zero experience in photography tournaments, but Im very glad of all the friendship and the results I had here...too much passion and sacrifice for this amazing hobby...for me it was a wonderful experience! I never ever think that I would trade experiences with so many people...even with the best astrophotographers of the world! It is a really great hobby, a part of my life, its some kind of thing beautifully worked up there and we are gifted and have the honor to see it! Many people here in Brazil didnt even notice it was possible taking this kind of pictures! Astronomy and Astrophotography are really beautiful! \r\n\r\nHope all of Astrobin members get as many as Iotds and Apods possible...but I think our mission is much wider than that...lets spread and hook the curiousity of youngsters to the sky wonders !! I had been hooked at 14 years old and it was the only dark sky I had seen till now unfortunately...but it was enough :-)",
