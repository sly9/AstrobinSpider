    "description": "Gabriela Mistral is a Southern Hemisphere nebula that bears the name of the chilean poet Gabriela Mistral, because of a resemblance with  the poet's profile (which is really striking once you've seen the photo). I only knew Pablo Neruda before. The title is of course a paraphrase of the famous Beatles song, \"Lucy in the sky with diamonds\", that actually was at the origin of the name given to Lucy, our australophitecine ancestor discovered by Donald Johanson in Hadar, Ethiopia. The song was played in the evening on the archeological camp. The diamonds are really well symbolized by the open cluster close to the center, NGC 3293, that contains multiple blue supergiants and a red supergiant.",
