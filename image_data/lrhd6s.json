    "description": "This is a new attempt at M51 using a now unused guide camera Altair Astro GPCAM2 for luminance and a newly acquired narrowband O3 Ha filter to bring out the Ha region with my ZWO ASI 2600MC-pro colour camera. The image is showing more detail than I could achieve with the colour camera alone and I pleased with the way the Ha regions are now more prominent. It could be improved with more enlightened processing no doubt but I have only been in the hobby for 12 months so it will have to do for now. A previous version with the colour camera only is on my web page and also in Astrobin for comparison purposes.",
