    "description": "This is a combination of two 12 minute live-stacks, one at a dark sky site and one on a good night from my backyard. The home image is a wide field and the dark sky image is narrow around the galaxy. I didn't realize how big it was and really preferred the wide field image, so I combined the two to make a deeper image. The wide field was good, but somewhat its contrast was reduced by light pollution. After several attempts, I got this image, which showed the detail in the arms that I had been hoping to pull out.\r\n\r\nThis galaxy is 10.14 magnitude, but is large and has  low surface brightness object that makes it hard to spot visually much of beyond the bright core. On my image its more than 5.5 by 7 arc minutes.",
