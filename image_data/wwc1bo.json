    "description": "After Hamburger galaxy, a second imaging object of the same night.\r\nProblem was to find adequate guiding star in OAG and 4s of guiding exposures were necessary.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Lovro DujniÄ‡ who was at the same time taking color photos of the same galaxy but in the wider FOV with his 250/1200 newtonian and Canon 1100D - 180sec x 29.\r\nThose photos were combined as color with mine Luminance images.",
