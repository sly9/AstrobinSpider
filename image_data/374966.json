    "description": "This object, the center of the Heart Nebula (IC 1805), is a fantastic mix of glowing interstellar gas, dark dust clouds, and brilliant stars located 7500 light years away in the Cassiopeia constellation. In the center of the image are the numerous bright white stars of a newborn star cluster known as Melotte 15. The cluster is named for its discoverer, Philibert Jacques Melotte (1880-1961). The stellar winds and radiation emitting from this cluster are sculpting the surrounding dust clouds into out of this world shapes, which is appropriate since it is out of this world.\r\n\r\nNormally I try to find one or two interesting aspects of an object to describe here, but in this case, there are so many that I don't know where to start.  High on my list is the central twisting, towering dust column.  I am not sure if there is a more amazing single object in the sky than this column.  I would like to know its overall length in light years but I couldn't find it.  I like the right edge of the column, which is brightly lit from the cluster.  I also love the detailed base of this column, with its deep shadows and intricate structure.  At the very top of the column is an interesting small 4 pronged cloud which appears to have a small star at the end of each prong.  On the left side of the image, the numerous triangular shape dust triangles, the top one looking like a dragon's head, are enthralling.  Some of them are dark against a light background, while others are light against a dark background.   This is an outstanding object which all astrophotographers should image at some point.",
