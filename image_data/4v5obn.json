    "description": "Following two weeks of dusty and cloudy nights, the sky was clear enough to give a shot at M3, one of the largest and brightest GC of the north hemisphere. I don't have much experience on imaging globular clusters so, after experimenting with the exposure time of the subs, I settled on the 150secs as a good compromise between signal strength and stars saturation. Processed in Pixinight with many small, non aggressive steps. \r\n\r\nI have also prepared an annotated image (Revision B) of the variable stars of the M3. This Globular Cluster  contains 274 known variable stars, by far the most found in any globular cluster.  (Mouse over)\r\n\r\nComments and constructive critique are most welcome!\r\nCS\r\nAndreas",
