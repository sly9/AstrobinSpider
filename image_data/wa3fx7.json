    "description": "This is an image I’ve wanted to shoot for a while, but I never knew if it would be possible under suburban light pollution....with a OSC, no less!\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\r\nMessier 81 and 82 are a beautiful galaxy pairing in the northern sky. One interesting thing about this area is that, from our vantage point, we look through the haze of the Integrated Flux Nebulae (IFN).\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\r\nThe IFN, or also called galactic cirrus, are clouds of dust particles above and below the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. These clouds are illuminated by all the starlight from within.  No matter what we do, we can’t escape light pollution, because this is it on a galactic scale.",
