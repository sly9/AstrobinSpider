    "description": "Jupiter in the evening of Thu 20 Jun 2019 AEST, second WinJUPOS composite.\r\n\r\nWas blessed with great seeing before the onset of fog shortly after midnight. Conditions were already sub-zero at 9 pm and it only got colder with every passing hour. \r\n\r\nThe view combines 9602 frames taken between 10:32 and 10:45 pm Canberra time. Turbulent GRS trailing region is on display here with eastward progress of ejected red material along the SEB boundary. Also lots of 'fins' have formed in that region which (as Chris Go pointed out on 22 Jun) are caused by small white STZ ovals impacting GRS perimeter.",
