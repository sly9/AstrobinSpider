With my main focus on the craters in this image. \r\n\r\nThis image was made with the use of 100 frames for the Light-side and 100 frames for the earth-shine. The earth shine is made up of an old full moon photo, due to how hard it was to get any earth-shine from the waning moon being so bright.\r\n\r\nStats \r\n:Canon EOS 1300D\r\n:ISO 100\r\n:Aperture F00\r\n:Lens-Skywatcher Maksutov Cassegrain BK MAK127 AZ GT\r\n:Editing software-Photoshop\r\n:Location -Yamba Australia",
