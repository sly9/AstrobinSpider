    "description": "the raw frames were taken partly from Namibia with a 8\" f/4 which did a great job in decollimating during the exposure sequence, and partly from Austria with my 10\" f/4, but the object is a bit low here and seeing was not really as we desire. So I tried to make the best out of 2 worlds, and recollimated and refocussed on the masterframes.\r\n\r\nBarnards Galaxy is a dwarf at 1.6 Mio. lightyears distance, and giant stars are easily resolved. There are some star factories at work, and bright emission and reflection nebulas adorn the mass of stars.",
