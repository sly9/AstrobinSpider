    "description": "My first very first mosiac! The image is Bi-color with RGB stars. Two panels consisting of Ha, OIII and RGB data for stars. I thought I would never get this completed as the weather has been, well... not too cooperative lately. Lots of clouds and rain. I guess that's one of the main reasons I have never attempted a mosiac. The clouds seem to hang around far too long when I start a new project. LOL!",
