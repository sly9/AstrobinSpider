    "description": "First light with my new ASI6200MM Pro, and first narrowband target for this season. It's interesting how one's personal tastes change when it comes to processing. When I started out I liked really contrast-y images with over-sharpened details and over-saturated colors. Now I find I gravitate toward images a that are a little softer with colors that are slightly more subdued. So with this I tried to find a balance between showcasing the fine detail and colors without pushing either too far.",
