    "description": "The crab in SHO. I did the \"colorful\" mapping of SHO.  I did two other mapping that were muted and looked a bit more refined.. but I prefer this version. This target has strong signal in all three channel resulting in a nice mix at the end.\r\n\r\nShot at unity gain at native focal length.\r\n\r\nThe dates of acquisition are approximate. They were shot over multiple days in august. I threw out a lot of subs and kept only the sharpest subs.",
