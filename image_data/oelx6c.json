    "description": "I've always thought this had the appearance of an eel, so that's what I'm going with, but it is often called Wolf's Cave. Nothing to do with a wolf, however; it just so happens that an astronomer named Max Wolf thought it looked like a cave upon discovery in 1908. vdb 152 is the blue reflection nebula embedded at the tip of the elongated dark nebula known as Barnard 175. The blue star illuminating it is presumed to just be a wandering star, as its velocity has been measured as being different than the cloud. Near the center-right is a very old planetary nebula known as Dengel-Hartl 5. The long red streaks are just a small portion of a very large and near supernova remnant SNR 110.3+11.3.",
