    "description": "Messier 42 needs no preamble.  It is around 1,400 light years away and about 24 light years across. \r\n\r\nThis is a 4 panel mosaic that Barry and I did on our remote FSQ106 rig.  Whilst M42 would have fitted within the FOV of the FSQ106 and KAF8300 combination, we wanted to set the nebula in a wider context.  For various reasons, it took us some time to complete the project.  We began on 11 January 2018 and did not finish until 13 January 2021.  \r\n\r\nTechnical details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106 \r\nCamera: QSI 683\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 72 x 1200s \r\nLum: 120 x 300s\r\nLum: 60 x 180s\r\nLum: 120 x 30s\r\nRed: 96 x 300s\r\nGreen: 96 x 300s\r\nBlue: 96 x 300s\r\n\r\nAt the same time that we were finishing the Tak Orion project, we were shooting another (2 panel) project of M43 and Running Man using our TEC 140 rig.  In revison D, I incorporated the data from the TEC project in an attempt to provide more resolution in the core.  \r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC 140\r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nLum: 72 x 600s\r\nLum: 24 x 60s\r\nLum: 24 x 15s\r\nRed: 60 x 300s\r\nGreen 60 x 300s\r\nBlue: 60 x 300s\r\n\r\nTotal exposure time 89 hours and 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nData: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nProcessing: Steve Milne",
