    "description": "As is typical, I have never been satisfied with any version of M101 I have ever produced--from any data set.  The most recent, collected with the TOA 130 was the strongest, though not quite as close in as I would have liked - so I cropped a bit to center the galaxy and provide a larger scale.  For me, M101 is an extremely difficult galaxy to render well.  I find the smallest of variations of brightness have great impact on the image.  Saturation is tricky as well.  My goal was not to over saturate, which is so commonly seen with M101--but to provide enough color to accentuate the various regions while staying true to the balance and overall hues revealed after color calibration.  I am undecided about the saturation levels. I have to retrain myself from bumping up the blues....an falling into the same old trap! Finally, background for me is difficult, for obtaining a decent background invariably impinges on the faint outer extensions of the galaxy.  My overall goal was to maintain balance.  I would have loved to depict more of the outer regions, but my sky makes that difficult.  I could have accentuated them more--but at the cost of balance.  I guess a lot more data would help.",
