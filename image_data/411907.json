    "description": "Whatever you are doing, just stop for a moment and look around.   Think about your place in it all.\r\n\r\nThe main galaxy grouping that makes up the Coma Cluster contains over 1000 galaxies in a small patch of sky toward the constellation Coma Berenices.   The average distance is 330 million light years.  Each faint, fuzzy blob of light is a galaxy containing millions to billions of stars.   The photons I captured in my backyard left these far-flung galaxies before dinosaurs roamed the Earth.\r\n\r\nThough it is not the colorful eye-candy of some close nebulae, I can think of no better demonstration of the vast reaches of space. \r\n\r\nAs always, enjoy!!",
