    "description": "Not often photographed, Polaris surrounded by Integrated Flux Nebula....Its surprising how much is there. I took this remotely from Spain with the 105 f1.4 Sigma lens and ASI2600MC Pier 4 at Roboscopes. 53x 300s unguided exposures a total of nearly 4 and a half hours. Processed with Pixinsight and Photoshop.\n\nThanks for looking\nPeter Shah",
