    "description": "I made this Photo during my last night at Athos Centro Astron√≥mico, La Palma, Spain. Since I had already demounted my equipment to be able to catch the flight later that day, I just used a tripod and did short exposures with a wide-angle lens and without tracking. The remaining bright dots between the plants are stars shining through the leaves (which can be seen by means of the Sigma 20mm DG HSM ART's Coma at f/2) and no hot pixels. They way the plants seem to reach out for space made me ponder, that's what I like about that image ...and that's what made me choose the slightly gooey title:-)",
