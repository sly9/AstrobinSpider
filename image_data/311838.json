    "description": "Archimedes, at 83-km-wide, is the largest impact crater in Mare Imbrium. The interior of the crater does not have a central peak and is flooded with mare basalt. \r\n\r\nThe crash site of the Russian Luna 2 spacecraft (the first man made object to land on any extra-terrestrial body) on the 13th September 1959 is shown about 80-90 km away from the Archimedes crater. The 58th anniversary of this anthropomorphic impact is in 2 days time. \r\n\r\nAnother very interesting feature in this image is the Catena Beer (previously known as Fossa Archimedes). A \"Catena\" is a chain of craters of craterlets, typically formed by the break-up of a meteorite prior to impact. A recent example was the \"Catena\" caused by comet Shoemaker Levy-9 on Jupiter, although no evidence remains of that particular Catena, many lunar Catena are well preserved and great objects to hunt for. I have managed to image 7 aligned craterlets at Catena Beer. Catena Beer was frequently photographed during the mission of Apollo 15.",
