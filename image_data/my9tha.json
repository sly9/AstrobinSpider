    "description": "Very good seeing conditions for Uranus at last dawn, the planet barely moved on the field for at least 2 minutes on IR! Small white spots are visible, perhaps thunderstorms that form large layers of ammonia crystal clouds in the upper atmosphere of the planet. We lived in a fantastic time, 20 years ago I could not imagine getting details in the atmosphere of Uranus with amateur instruments!",
