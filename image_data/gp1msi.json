    "description": "Today I'm posting my first DSO shot of 2020 (NGC 3372 - Carina Nebula), which was taken from my house, located in the light-polluted metropolitan area of Lima-Per√∫.\r\n\r\nSeeing was bad and worm's supermoon was high in the sky. Despite that, I could get some nice details of this southern object with good results, using a dual band filter. \r\n\r\nI hope you like it !",
