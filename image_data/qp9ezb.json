    "description": "Since the first time I saw Rho Ophiucus I fell in love with it... So, I took the change to work on it as soon as there were a couple of nights without rain or clouds.\r\nThis photo is 1x2 mosaic, which I intend to expand in the next few year. Unfortunately the integration time isn't much (about 3 hours for each panel) since this is really low on my horizon. Some clouds rolled in and I had to local normalize the photos, otherwise I'd had only 1.5 hours worth of data.\r\nBuilding the mosaic was a real challenge, which was only overcome by using PI Photometric Mosaic script. The author, John Murphy (https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnastro-info/), was kind enough to help me in that task and I became a fan of it. It's not an easy script but results are well worth the effort to learn it (documentation available is excellent).\r\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy this one as much as I enjoyed!",
