    "description": "SH2-115 is a well structured emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus. It mainly features Ha colors. In his neigborhood (top right of the frame) we find the Object Abell 71/Sh2-116. Abell 71 is still discussed to be a planetary nebula or just an Ha emission nebula.\r\n\r\nThe image was shot in a short gap between a thunderstorm and twilight, Therefore the image has gathered just about 2.8 hrs of light.\r\n\r\n25 x 200s Ha Baader 7.5 nm at gain 76\r\n25 x 200s OIII Chroma 3nm at gain 76\r\n\r\nASI1600mmp and TS 130/910 mm apo with 0.79 x reducer.",
