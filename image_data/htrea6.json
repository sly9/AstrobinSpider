    "description": "This is an annual attempt of M31. \r\n\r\nThere are many challneges as usual. The weather, the hardware and the processing. \r\n\r\nI remember the thrill when I first manually go-to the M31 through a C8. The little fuzzy light ball in the center of eye piece was merely the center of this magnificent giant. Yet it was sufficient to keep my goosebumps up for a significant while. \r\n\r\nSince then, I paid an annual tribute to the very target. It becomes a reference for me. And every year I tried to beat what I have achieved in the pass. Fortunately, I think j have done it this year.  \r\n\r\nThe weather was quite intimidating this year. With the prolong rain season, I have to salvage every minute between the clear sky. Not to mentioned the haunting guider and unstable remote connection through my ancient cell phone. \r\n\r\nAs my other remote works, I dedicated a lot of imaging time to a single target. The result is satisfying. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading and clear sky.\r\n\r\n-Doug",
