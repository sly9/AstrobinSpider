    "description": "This composition represents the continuation of a work begun in 2015, when I performed the first composition in which the separation and displacement of Sirius B was perceived.\r\n\r\nEach single source image, all taken with the ED 127mm refractor used at f/45 + ROI, is the result of the manual stack of 15-20 \"super-frames\" (ie of excellent quality) extracted for inspection and visual evaluation from films composed of 250 (therefore about 7% of the total). The individual subframes were manually aligned on the middle centroid (the large white disk that is seen is not Sirius, but his confusing figure!), And rotated until Sirius B matches the theoretical curve of the orbit, with good agreement. The image is therefore not a stack but a multilevel composition.\r\n\r\nPlease note that although I have been taking pictures for all years between 2012 and 2020, some of them have been kept out for a cleaner and more readable composition. With 8 subframes you get almost a startrail.",
