    "description": "The summer has proven challenging weather-wise here in the UK.  The original plan was for 5 hours each of SII, Ha and OIII on this object.  I got pretty close to completion last night before the clouds rolled in.  I have decided to call it therefore, even though I am still 4 subs short of target.  This is my Esprit 120, with QSI 690 atop a Mesu 200 in my home observatory.   \r\n\r\nData captured between 27 May and 19 August 2017.  Jings that is one image per quarter - told you it had been challenging.",
