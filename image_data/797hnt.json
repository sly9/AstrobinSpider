    "description": "IC 1848, commonly known as the Soul Nebula, is a large area of nebulosity in Cassiopeia and the companion of IC 1805, the Heart Nebula. These beautiful neighbors lie 6500 and 7500 light years away, respectively. \r\n\r\nThis is a modified Hubble palette image that I processed using PixInsight, with finishing touches in Lightroom. I managed to capture over 32 hours of data for this project, and the data was much cleaner and less noisy than that of my sub-10-hour integrations. I am still on the steep part of the learning curve with narrowband processing. I feel I have learned a lot from this project, though. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking.",
