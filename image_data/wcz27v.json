    "description": "This is a reprocessed image of IC1805 with SII data that I have acquired in 2018, but couldn't  get my hands on since then. The total time shows as 27 hours, but in fact I spent less time shooting, thanks to a dual telescope configuration. All the time spent on the rig adjustments was well paid off later when I could complete the task in about half of the necessary time. And that's, IMHO, probably the most important benefit of having a dual rig. In my case, as probably for many of us, the weather could be uncooperative for a very long time and it becomes critical to use any clear night as much as possible. Having two scopes working for the same target greatly improves the effectiveness of this process.",
