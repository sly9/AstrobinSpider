    "description": "NGC 55, also occasionally referred to as The Whale Galaxy, is a Magellanic type barred spiral galaxy located about 6.5 million light-years away in the constellation Sculptor.\r\n\r\nAlong with its neighbor NGC 300, it is one of the closest galaxies to the Local Group, probably lying between the Milky Way and the Sculptor Group.\r\n\r\nNGC 55 and the spiral galaxy NGC 300 have traditionally been identified as members of the Sculptor Group, a nearby group of galaxies in the constellation of the same name. However, recent distance measurements indicate that the two galaxies actually lie in the foreground.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that NGC 55 and NGC 300 form a gravitationally bound pair.\r\n\r\nRA: 12h 42m 08.0s\r\nDEC: +32° 32' 29\"\r\nLocation: Canes Venatici\r\nDistance: 30 Mly\r\n\r\nAcquisition September 2020\r\nTotal acquisition time: 1.1 hours.\r\nBased on data from Telescope.live CHI-1\r\n\r\nTechnical Details\r\nLocation: El Sauce Observatory, Rio Hurtado, Chile\r\nL 4 x 300 sec\r\nR 3 x 300 sec\r\nG 4 x 300 sec\r\nB 2 x 300 sec\r\nOptics: Planewave 24“ CDK @ F6.5\r\nCCD: FLI PL 9000\r\nPre Processing: CCDstack & Pixinsight\r\nPost Processing: Photoshop CC, Lightroom",
