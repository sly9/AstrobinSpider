    "description": "This planetary nebula Abell56, also known as PK 037-03.2 and PN G037.9-03.4, is a very rarely imaged object with almost nothing published about it.  I came across it when looking at Gary Imm's images.  He has a very nice version of this, and also could not find much info about it.\r\nI quote some of his helpful comments:\r\n\"This PN is unusual in both its color and its structure. Few PN are absent of OIII like this one. Also, few PN have such a wide, bright circular ring structure. There is also some bi-polar, or even multi-polar, structure seen in the image. This is indicated by a faint eye-shape, with the long axis oriented from top right to bottom left. This reminds me a bit of the Helix Nebula without the OIII signal. Also, the full resolution view shows an extremely faint, tiny blue star which I believe is the central star.\"\r\nIn his version you can see the tiny blue star in the center.  You can see it in my version, and with some imagination you can think it is blue, definitely not white or yellow.",
