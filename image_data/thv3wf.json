    "description": "This is a 20-hour exposure of the western veil nebula taken from my driveway. I had a series of clear nights and decided to take an extra-long exposure. I decided to upload the starless version.  I typically don't like the starless versions but this one was quite nice!  It looks like some sort of blood vessel or something.  Let me know which you like more!",
