Relatively bright in planet Earth's sky, NGC 3521 is easily visible in small telescopes but often overlooked by amateur imagers in favor of other Leo spiral galaxies, like M66 and M65. It's hard to overlook in this colorful cosmic portrait, (APOD)\n\n***Processing Information till now this has been the most difficult object to process, i spent more than 20+hrs processing this galaxy, i used Photoshop, ccd stack and pixinsight, structure pulling was mainly done by layers and mask, as it was quite dim so combination of noise reduction and masking helped a lot , adding more tone to structure was done in Pixinsight thanks to dear friend marcel for some final color correction. Ps : the signal was way to faint so only option was these ðŸ™‚\nAll data shot from Remote observatory\ntechnical Details : 16\"F3.7 Dream Scope Astrograph, FLI PL16803 CCD,B adderLRGBha filters Around 291Mins of L 125mins of Red Green Blue 600sec X 6 Bin 2x2 halpha 11.85 hrs total LRGBha Data under Pristine Dark skies of New Mexico www.insightobservatory.com Copyright and Credits: UtkarshMishra, Michael Petrasko,Muir Evenden",
