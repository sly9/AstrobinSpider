    "description": "ic2944 (SHO_RGB). The raw files were of exceptional quality and really pleasant to process (compared to mine!!!) they are from courtesy of the french association AIP (Astro Images Processing). I did myself all the pre and post processing. The RGB layer is used for star color purpose. The SHO processing is my first attempt and the color balance was one of the most tricky thing to manage as there are many rendering options. Halpha is used as luminance layer.\r\n\r\nthe equipments are as follows:\r\nNewton ASA 500mm f/3.6\r\nASA DDM85\r\nCCD FLI Proline16803",
