    "description": "Ok here's a much better version of the Dragons and the Egg than I have ever captured, I experimented with Astropixel processor and combined 2 stacked and calibrated images in HA and O3. One image from my Skywatcher ed72 and one from my ts130 so I then let Astropixel processor do its things and it combined them both into one giant image I then had to downsample, the result is a much better version, I combined them in Photoshop and processed and voila.\r\n\r\nAbout 3 hours and a half of 10 minute total integration per image\r\n\r\nAll with the 294mc pro and the optolong L-Extreme on the Skywatcher NeQ6 mount",
