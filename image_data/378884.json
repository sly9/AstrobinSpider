    "description": "It was not easy to create a such large panorama with the stacked panorama processing method. Some artifacts are still there and its very hard to erase these little gradients. \r\n\r\nThis is my massive panorama from the amazing namibian sky. I was there in may. We have 14 totaly clear night, where the Milky Way cast shadows on the ground.\r\n\r\nI needed four day's to realize, that our galaxy core is up in the zenith. Incredible details with naked eye. You have to try. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we have the dim part of the Milky Way in the northern hemisphere. Lucky southern people. I'm a little envious. :-)))",
