    "description": "My sky was not that great tonight.  There were high thin clouds moving around.  Finally after\r\ntaking 60 light frames  clouds covered the sky and shut me down.   I had to trash some light\r\nframes because of the clouds and some that I used were questionable.   I decided before I\r\nwent outside that I was going to try and image IC 1805 again.   I've tried 4 or 5 times to image\r\nthis object and I just can't get an image that I'm pleased with.   Tonight was no exception.   \r\nI did get an image but  it leaves a lot to be desired.   For me this is a hard object to image.\r\nThe nebulosity that makes the heart shape is very dim.   I can just barely see a shadow of it in a\r\nraw frame.  The bottom of the nebula which is NGC 896 the Fish Head Nebula and the center\r\nof the heart  IC 1805 is very bright and easily seen.   I can stretch the data till I'm blue in the\r\nface but I can't bring out much nebulosity detail in the wall that makes the heart shape.  \r\nThere is no body or density to that part of the nebula.  In my images it looks almost\r\nlike a red shadow for lack of a better description.    Anyway enough whining.  Even though I'm not pleased with the image I decided to post it because I did take the image and  I'll have\r\nit in my profile and can compare it to other images I take of this object.  With all of that\r\nsaid please enjoy my most recent image of IC 1805.",
