    "description": "NGC 3717 is a spiral galaxy in the constellation of Hydra located around 85 million light years from here. The galaxy is seen almost edge on, but is tilted enough to show a bit of the disc and central bulge.\nThe galaxy is quite small in the field of view, and requires a fairly long focal length telescope to resolve details.\nThis is the first image from our Planewave CDK1000 1 meter telescope.\nImaged in LRGB at El Sauce (Obstech), Chile.\n\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\n\nSystem control Software: Voyager by Leonardo Orazi \nhttps://www.facebook.com/masterdarksastro/",
