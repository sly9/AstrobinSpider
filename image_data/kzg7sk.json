    "description": "I've seen some in the literature refer to NGC 7822 as the Flaming Skull Nebula, but that name seems to be more formally reserved for the planetary nebula Sh2-68. In any case, embedded in this gorgeous formation is another object many refer to as the Teddy Bear Nebula, Sh2-171. I'm not particular about the informal name for it, it's still one of my favorite DSOs.\r\n\r\nThis image is a two-panel mosaic taken on our recent dark-sky trip to Big Bend. It's probably the first good mosaic we've been able to capture and has given us the skills and confidence to go after many more in the future.",
