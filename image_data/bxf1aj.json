    "description": "This shot of M51 was taken with the TPO RC8 while I was still testing it.  Unfortunately, the scope and I did not end up as friends and I forgot about this image.  I ran back across it last night and decided to process it.  Not the greatest image, I know, but I thought it had some high points, so I decided to post it.\r\n\r\nL: 120x120s\r\nR: 30x120s\r\nG: 30x120s\r\nB: 30x120s",
