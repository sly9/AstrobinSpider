    "description": "DWB 111, also known as the Propeller Nebula is a hydrogen-alpha emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus. The propeller shape is actually a small portion of a much larger emission nebula, which can be seen as faint red hydrogen-alpha nebulosity throughout the image frame.  I believe this distance of this object is not known.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this image.",
