    "description": "NGC 3718 has become one of my favorite galaxies.  I'll have to study \"what happened\" to form this.  Then what's going on just to the left of NGC3718?  that is PGC35620 & 35618\r\n\r\nSo I have good data taken 2 nights from Mt Pinos 85 miles north of LA at 8,300', class 3, new moon, cold and low moisture.   \r\nLum - 45 x 300s\r\nRGB - 22 x 300s each\r\nLeXtreme Ha & Oiii 25 x 300s\r\n\r\nNew at mono camera and LRGB filters.  I integrated in APP,  and used its many different methods to combine:  RGB1, RGB2, LRGB1, HaRGB, HaRGB2, HaLRGB methodologies.  I also combined in Pixinsight using linear ChannelCombination and non linear RGBCombination and then added Ha with the NBRGB Combination script.  Just these were 4+ gigs!    \r\n\r\nI had so many different versions, clones on clones, linearFit on different channels, on and on.  I kind of forget what this posted image's methodology is, but my best memory is Pix linear ChannelCombination with green as the linearFit basis.  I had to manually align the color channels in Histogram stretch.  Interestingly, the color clearly changes depending on the method and all methods produced usable results. This mono LRGB is turning into a full time job...a job which I like so far, but I must get more efficient.   \r\n\r\nI appreciate any and all comments, critique and suggestions.  CS on the new moon!",
