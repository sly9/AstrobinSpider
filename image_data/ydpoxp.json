    "description": "spent this week collecting data on the Spaghetti Nebula (Simesis 147) and did not know it was a very faint target upfront. Ended up culling 5 hours of data as there were reflections from a nearby star, even a full stretch did not show the reflections initially.\r\n\r\nAfter spending an hour or so the following night, I got FOV spot where the reflections did not show up that much, and went on and added more data.\r\n\r\nOiii is still faint, I did not push it any further than it already was, I guess this target is better suited for a mono and left the overall color as default this time.",
