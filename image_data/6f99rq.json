    "description": "This is maybe a little close for this object, and not helped by being cropped due to a dull rotational accident on a third of the subs. I would like to have another go using a widefield setup so I can pull in the tail and some of the surrounding LDNs. That said, it is nice to see some detail through what always seemed to be high hazy clouds.\r\n\r\nTaken at 1200mm with my SX_H694 over a few nights as I tried to weed out the poorer subs and still give myself enough to work with. In the end this effort is 105 x 300\" Lum, and near enough 50 x 180\" each of RGB. Ha was a total write off and i struggled with the bright star and reflections especially in the blue at this focal length.",
