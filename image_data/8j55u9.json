    "description": "Imaged on nights of 9/29/2020, 9/30/2020, 10/4/2020, 10/14/2020. \r\n\r\nAbell 16 (PK 153+22 1) is a bubble planetary nebula located approximately 4,445 light-years away in Lynx.\r\nIt is fairly large for a PN at 2.3 arc minutes.  Magnitude is 15.3 and the Oiii is about 3 times stronger than Ha, somewhat dim but not nearly as weak as many other PNs.\r\nA distinct blue star is directly in the center, and the entire PN is perfectly circular and very uniform.\r\nThe color of the PN exactly matches the ratios of the PN area in the RGB only version of the image, just enhanced in intensity.  The PN barely shows on the RGB confirming the Ha and Oiii are very weak.",
