    "description": "Storms have been rolling through one after another without much of a break, until last week when the sky was visible for a few hours over two night. Seagull Nebula rises only 20 degrees or so above my house and tree line for about four hours a night. I was able to capture 8 hours of narrowband and a bit or RGB data, not nearly enough to achieve the detail and suppress the noise, but enough to get a start at imaging this object. This rendition is SHO using a standard Hubble Palette.\r\n\r\nSince there is no clear weather in the near future I'll have to wait until next year to finish data collection. This first processing effort tells me I need two to three times more data to do justice to this wonderful nebula.",
