    "description": "Although NGC2841 has been imaged a few times, only a handfull seem to really capture its beauty, especially in Kent Wood's capture of the very faint extended arms.   \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/390497/C/\">NGC2841 by Kent Wood</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.caelumobservatory.com/gallery/n2841.shtml\">NGC2841 by Adam Block</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2014/04/ngc-2841-robert-gendler-photo-of-a-spectacular-spiral.html\">NGC2841 by Robert Gendler</a>\r\n\r\nDuring this time of the year, seeing is extremely good in Julian, CA. But with no marine layer covering the lower cities, 21.2 SQM is the darkest I'm seeing. Nevertheless, 9+ hours of Luminance in a 24\" does appear to capture a few photons from 46 MLY. (-:\r\n\r\n\"NGC 2841 is an inclined, unbarred, spiral galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major that exhibits a prominent inner ring structure. Initially thought to be about 30 million light-years distant, a 2001 Hubble Space Telescope survey of the galaxy's Cepheid variables determined its distance to be approximately 46 million light-years.\"\r\n\r\n***Version B re-captures color without moon.***",
