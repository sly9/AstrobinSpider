    "description": "9,000 light years away is this spectacular scene. NGC 3576 - a statue rising out of dense clouds with filaments looping overhead shaped by powerful stellar winds. Next to it is NGC 3603 - a glowing cloud of gas, dust and stars some 11,000 light years further on. At the center of this you can see a Wolf–Rayet multiple star system, known as HD 97950. \r\n\r\nCaptured with the Sky-Watcher Esprit 100 and the ZWO 294MM using 600sec subs in bin 1x1 mode which utilises the pixels at their native tiny size. I'm a definite fan of it after processing this image. \r\n\r\nThis is the third year in a row I've captured this nebula. Each time I'm happier with the results.",
