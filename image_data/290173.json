    "description": "Data capture for this object began in February and, courtesy of our UK weather, continued through until April.  Barry captured the RGB data on his WO FLT 132 and QSI 683.  I was able to get Lum and Ha on my Esprit 120/QSI 690 combination.  Filters were Astrodon.  It took so many nights that I hope you will forgive me if I just put down the final night as the capture date.",
