    "description": "What started out as a grand idea of a high resolution mosaic of the IC434 region, turned in to a bit of a problem!  We successfully shot L and H from the CDK14, but this was back when we were using other telescopes for color data.  I could never get everything aligned right with the stars from the refractor setup across the entire mosaic, so we may have to return next year to get color with the CDK.  For now, here's the Luminance only of this amazing region.  \r\n\r\nCopyright Casey Good/Steve Timmons",
