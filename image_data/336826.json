    "description": "I used one of my best photos from last year to create a polar projection from the Win Jupiter. For those who do not know, this program is very interesting possessing a large number of resources and the creation of a projection of the pole is just one of them. Note that this is not invented, it is the photo as if it were viewed from above one of the poles.",
