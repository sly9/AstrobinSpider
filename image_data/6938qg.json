    "description": "I finally found some time to process the data for the 2-panel M31 mosaic. This is the first time in many years that I was able to create a detailed image of our neighbor galaxy. \r\nThe LRGB data was acquired over two nights at a dark site while Ha narrowband signal comes from my backyard acquisition. I was lucky to get good seeing during both nights so I am happy with the details. It turns our that even with a mosaic the real extent of the galaxy is larger than what I was able to capture. On the other hand, I was happy to see that the dim extended halo is not without features. There are clear dark lanes extending far from the central region. All in all, at this scale the resemblance with our own Milky way is more obvious but so are the differences.",
