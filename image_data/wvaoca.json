    "description": "While capturing comet NEOWISE this morning with my telescope, I luckily brought a second camera and second tripod. I made some timelapses of the moving comet with 50mm focal length and suddenly NLCs appeared! So I took some extra shots with a well-thought framing and this is the result! A nice colorful dawn, some decent noctilucent clouds and comet NEOWISE, all with reflections in the water!",
