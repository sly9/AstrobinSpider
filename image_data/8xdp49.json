    "description": "The data here was taken over the last 2 nights. So pre-season?  I'm really ready for nebula season. \r\n\r\nI stayed up all night to get this.  Prior I was bouncing from galaxy to galaxy checking things out.  Tough time of the year for the redcat owners overall.  The Ha didn't have the best seeing but I wasn't going to let a somewhat clear night stop me when I knew I had a week and a half of clouds coming. \r\n\r\nThis is the first image I've tried to truly grab those golds and pull them out. It's really begging for more data and the first chance I get I will do so.  I didn't think it was to bad for such short integration.  I do plan to add SII when I can.",
