    "description": "In the upper left is the bright star HD26799, but on the right hand side a cosmic drama is slowly unfolding. The two galaxies NGC1532 and NGC1531 have collided, and streams of stars are strung out in the wake of this intergalactic smash. Bright regions in the larger of the two galaxies indicate intense star formation triggered by the interaction. About 50 million light years away, the large apparent size of this galaxy is an indication of how far the debris is thrown in these types of interactions. In the background, numerous small galaxies watch on in horror...\r\nThis image was taken over two nights through the 16\" on top of my house in Mt Pleasant, 10km south of Perth's CBD.",
