    "description": "A closer study of the fascinating dynamic central regions of the Rosette Nebula, contrasting with my previous widefield images, http://astrob.in/237827/C/.  Gathered in weather breaks from late December to date.\r\n\r\nThe Rosette is a glorious object no matter how presented, however the rich blues of the central region and ribbon of animal shapes including the obvious \"leaping cheetah\", really do sparkle in NB data, as they are blown and shaped from the vigorous radiation emitted by the central cluster.\r\n\r\nCS to all!",
