    "description": "Mars in the early hours of Mon 28 Sep 2020 AEST - annotated version.\r\n\r\nImaged Red Planet for just under two hours in alternating seeing conditions. This is a WinJUPOS derotated view of seven best four minute stacks captured between 1:42 and 2:15 am local time.\r\n\r\nVolcanic peaks of Elysium Mons and Hecates Tholus are prominent in the north west as is the blue-white cloud covering polar latitudes. To the south dark tongue of Sinus Gomer protrudes from Mare Cimmerum. On the P limb orographic cloud of already set Arsia Mons volcano is still visible, as is caldera of Olympus Mons immediately to its north. Eridania, Mare Chronium and Electris dominate the southern hemisphere. South Polar Cap was still relatively large in late September.",
