    "description": "In the constellation Monoceros, the light and hot matter from young, energetic stars cause the interstellar dust and gas to fold, twist, and stretch. The tree-shaped cloud created, nearly 100 light-years long, is decorated with glowing gases and starlight.\r\n\r\nFor this image I combined 19 hours of 2018 narrowband data taken with a 336mm FL telescope with 9 hours of newly acquired Ha data taken with a 925mm FL telescope. The color mapping was done with the 2018 data and the new 2020 data were used as a luminance layer.  This is an SHO rendition.",
