    "description": "Captured on Friday, July 10th at Cloudland Canyon State Park with the Barnard Astronomical Society. Half the image was acquired before the 50% Moon come up, the other have acquired with the moon rising before calibration frames and a break for comet Neowise.   A short video of the acquisition can be seen here: https://youtu.be/GxkL32vo7lY\r\n\r\nAbout:  From wiki -The Trifid Nebula (catalogued as Messier 20 or M20 and as NGC 6514) is an H II region located in Sagittarius. It was discovered by Charles Messier on June 5, 1764.  Its name means 'divided into three lobes'. The object is an unusual combination of an open cluster of stars; an emission nebula (the lower, red portion), a reflection nebula (the upper, blue portion) and a dark nebula (the apparent 'gaps' within the emission nebula that cause the trifurcated appearance; these are also designated Barnard 85). Viewed through a small telescope, the Trifid Nebula is a bright and peculiar object, and is thus a perennial favorite of amateur astronomers.\r\n\r\nEquipment: \r\nTelescope- Celestron Edge HD 11‚Äù w/.7 reducer\r\nCamera- QHY 168C \r\nFilter- IDAS LP2\r\nGuiding camera- QHY 174mm\r\nMount- Astro-Physics 1100gto\r\n\r\nAcquisition:\r\n45 x 3minute light exposures \r\n12 dark frames\r\n12 bias frames\r\n12 sky flats \r\n\r\nCalibration:\r\nPixinsight processing \r\n-Weighted Batch Pre Processing with The Cosmetic Correction applied\r\n-Photometric Color Calibration\r\n-Histogram Transformation\r\n-SCNR in green Channel\r\n-Exported to Photoshop for levels adjustment and export",
