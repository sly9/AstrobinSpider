    "description": "First light for my new full frame camera. The weather and fires in California only let me  collect data for one target during August new moon. Only 1/2 time for H-alpha actually turned out to be enough, and extra SII and OIII hours allowed to use both for luminance which brings additional detail.\r\n\r\nI chose a more authentic SHO palette this time (over Hubble variety) as it highlights  intensity distribution for different emission lines very well.\r\n\r\nThis target is very interesting as we see two distinctly different types of nebulosity. Sh2-115 itself is a typical star birth region illuminated by hot stars with dark columns, globules and prominent OIII regions. It is projected onto wisps of larger clouds with little ionized oxygen emission so typical for this part of Cygnus. Here we see some interesting filaments in SII signal. I am not sure what physical conditions in the interstellar medium they correspond to to.\r\n\r\nAbell 71 / PK 85+4.1 on the lower left is a nice little gem of a planetary nebula.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the full frame camera is tremendous so viewing at full scale is recommended even if the uploaded image is already down-sampled by a factor of 2. I left some prominent star halos intact as they looked pleasing to my eye.",
