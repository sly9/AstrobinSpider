    "description": "\"Second light\" with the tandem setup and the ASI2600MC Pro.  RGB data is only 4hrs; no luminance as the Moon was bright.   Ha is 5hrs and OIII is 14.5hrs from 2017 (see here: https://www.astrobin.com/317335/F/).\r\nSee the field of view of the \"smaller\" G4 in black and white for the Ha.  \r\nPretty pleased with the performance of the ASI2600 for colour.  Tilt and flats are not entirely right yet.",
