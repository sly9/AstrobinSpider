    "description": ".... because \"Pillars of Creation\" was already taken. \r\n\r\nNGC6820 is the name given to this area of emission nebula.  NGC6823 is the designation for the open cluster off the tip of the largest pillar seen here.   The complex sits approximately 6000 light years away in the constellation of Vulpecula.   It is a star forming region and bears a striking structural resemblance to the Eagle Nebula, M16.   \r\n\r\nThis entire area is bathed in plentiful hydrogen alpha emission, but when it came time to layer on the oxygen I knew I had some problems.   The resulting image involved a lot work to achieve a balance where the oxygen could even be perceived.  Then came the challenge of trying to find a visually pleasing mix.    I arrived on this for a first pass.   I'll also try out a more color-realistic blend â€¦ once my eyes rest.",
