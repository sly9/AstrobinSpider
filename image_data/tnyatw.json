    "description": "This is it! Centaurus A! My first 2020 Galaxy processing with data captured from one of the most privileged skies in the world in Chile at EL Sauce Observatory. This is what an hour of data looks like from 1525m and no light pollution.\r\n\r\nCentaurus A or NGC 5128 is a galaxy in the constellation of Centaurus. It's is located 10-16 million light yeas away. Is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth and is the fifth-brightest in the sky. The center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of 55 million solar masses, which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. By taking radio observations of the jet separated by a decade, astronomers have determined that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about half of the speed of light.\r\n\r\nThis is part of an ongoing collaboration project with Nelson Ortega Torres, Wanda Conde Silva and Rafael Emmanuelli Jiménez. We will arrange capture plans with TelescopeLive from Chile's Obstech - Observatorio El Sauce skies and process them. We want to work with data from objects captured in the southern hemisphere that we wouldn't be able to capture in the island due to our unpredicted weather and heavy light pollution. We will work with data taken with high quality equipment in perfect sky conditions!\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Samuel Ropert Rossel and José Joaquín Pérez Guy.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n03.30.2020\r\nRío Hurtado Valley, Chile\r\nCamera: FLI PL 9000\r\nTelescope: PlaneWave Instruments INC CDK24 (24”) (3962 mm)\r\nMount: Mathis MI-1000/1250\r\nExposure Time: 60 mins (30 x 120ss)\r\n⁣Filters: RGB\r\nCalibration Frames: Darks, Bias, Flats\r\nSoftwares: PixInsight",
