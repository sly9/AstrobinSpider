    "description": "After having seen Rodd's wide field image of Thor's Helmet (https://www.astrobin.com/384642) I went back to this data to see if I could bring out more of the red Ha signal, and yes there were plenty. So much that it became a completely different image and I therefore post it separately.\r\n\r\nSo, this is the same 6 hours of Ha and Oiii data that I processed from Astrobin public data pool posted by Robert Huerbsch. Scope: AT130EDT. Camera: QHY163m with Astronomik Deepsky 6nm Ha, O3 filters\r\nFrames: 70 x 150s each Ha, O3 at gain 139 and 200.\r\n\r\nThanks again for posting your data Robert!",
