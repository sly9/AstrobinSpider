    "description": "Target:\r\nThe Gabriela Mistral & Carina Nebulae. NGC3324, IC2599, NGC 3372.\r\n\r\nNGC 3324 is an open cluster in the southern constellation Carina, located northwest of the Carina Nebula (NGC 3372) at a distance of 7,560 ly from Earth.\r\nThe intense ultraviolet radiation from several of NGC 3324's hot young stars causes the gas cloud to glow with rich colours, and combined with the stars Stellar winds has blown open a hollow in the surrounding gas and dust. \r\nIt is closely associated with the emission nebula IC 2599, and the two are often confused as a single object which has been nicknamed the \"Gabriela Mistral Nebula\".\r\nThis is due to its resemblance to the side profile of Chilean poet, who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1945. \r\nThe 'bump' in the centre of the prominent gas wall resembles a human nose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquisition:\r\n18th February 2021\r\nBortle Class 6 Sky in Victoria, Australia\r\nIntegration Time: 2 hours 18 minutes @ f/4\r\nLights: Ha 9x360s, Oiii 8x360s, Sii 6x360s\r\nCalibration: 80 Darks, No Flats or Bias.",
