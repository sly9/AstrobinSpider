    "description": "Venus yesterday afternoon with lots of clouds and seeing total crazy! Only got a good capture in the infrared range (> 807nm), in ultraviolet the planet barely gave focus, frustrating! However many details appeared in the IR, details in the deepest layers of the Venusian atmosphere, between 65 and 75km from the surface.",
