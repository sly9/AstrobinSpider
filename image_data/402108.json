    "description": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nas you may know Chilescope was hosting a contest for editing astroimages. Unfortunately I was so busy at the time that I did not manage to enter the contest, but I still want to share my result with you. I have to say that this was one of the easiest data sets I ever worked with. Having no light pollution really is such a benefit in addition to the high etendue setup they have there.\r\n\r\nFor some reason I am also really starting to like diffraction spikes :D",
