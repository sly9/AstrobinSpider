    "description": "Centaurus A has been studied extensively by astronomers given that it is a strong source of radio waves and x-ray transmissions. It is classified as an elliptical galaxy and is thought to have been formed from a collision with a smaller spiral galaxy. There is a supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy that is the source of the x-ray transmissions.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of NGC 5128 is quite distinctive and it is often referred to as the 'hamburger galaxy'. It is a bright object that makes for a nice imaging target. The original name of Centaurus A for this galaxy dates back to the cataloging of sources of radio transmissions. Centaurus A was the first bright source of radio emissions discovered in Centaurus.",
