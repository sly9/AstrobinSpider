    "description": "NGC 1316 is a huge elliptical galaxy 75 million light years away in the constellation of Fornax. It is part of the Fornax group and is one of the brightest elliptical galaxies. Astronomers believe that NGC 1316 collided with the smaller galaxy NGC 1317 seen above the main galaxy. These tidal features show as ripples, loops and plumes which can be seen in this image. The dustpans that can be seen would indicate that NGC 1316 was likely the result of a merger of galaxies long ago.\r\n\r\nImaged on our Officina Stellare RiDK 400 at Obstech, Chile\r\nImage Processing: Mike Selby\r\nSystem Control Software: Voyager by Leo Orazi\r\nRiDK 400 Team: Mike Selby , Stefan Schmidt, Leo Orazi, John Kasianowicz, Scott Johnson, Josh Balsam, Rick Stevenson\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/masterdarkastro/",
