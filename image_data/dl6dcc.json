    "description": "Somewhere around 100 million light years away toward the constellation Virgo, this beautiful galaxy pairing lights up your night sky (faintly). The collection known as ARP271 consists of NGC5427, the larger face on spiral seen here on the right, and NGC5426 on the left.\r\nâ €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €\r\nThese two are currently in a galactic ballet, passing each other close enough to affect each other gravitationally. The subtle bending of the spiral arms can be seen, as well as, a bridge of stars strewn out into intergalactic space. What would the night sky look like from a planet around one of these stars, ðŸ˜¯?!\r\nâ €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €\r\nIf you havenâ€™t guessed this is a challenging and tiny target, with a separation of only 2 arc-minutes!\r\nâ €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €\r\nAs always, enjoy, and let me know what you think in the comments",
