    "description": "Wow the dust storm situation on Mars is evolving rapidly.\r\nThere seems to be intense activity as denoted by the brighter spots in the area of Deucalionis Regio, south of Sinus Meridiani which itself is starting to become obscured by fingers of dust spreading north. The southern part of Sinus Sabeuas is also obscured but the northern part remains clear. It seems as if a great deal of the dust that is now covering Aurorae Sinus, Oxia Palus etc, is originating with this intense activity and being spread in the f direction by trade winds.\r\nThe dust is spreading towards the south pole and covering quite a large area.\r\nAlso further round the f limb the dust has become quite extensive as I have observed in the images of others such as Luke Gulliver from Western Australia.",
