    "description": "The weather is still bad so I decided to process some data from August 2020, what I shot but not processed. \r\n\r\nI shot 180 x 30 sec luminance frames with the ASI174mm.\r\nThe color image is from 2018 and contains M31  and  M110 .\r\nThe camera for the colour image was the Moravian G3-11000c / 12 x 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nMessier 110,  is a dwarf elliptical galaxy that is one of the satellites of the Andromeda Galaxy.\r\nM110 probably does not have a supermassive black hole in its center like most galaxies.",
