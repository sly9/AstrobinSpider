    "description": "Well. I was planning on an hour animation but clouds rolled in. I was able to get 40 minutes but I think this will be the only useable frame due to terrible seeing.  \r\n\r\nHere is the master frame.  If you publish it please give me credit for the data :)\r\n\r\nMy processing\r\nImPPG for deconvolution and sharpening\r\nPS: Crop, high pass filter.  \r\nPI: ABE, subtract, normalize (helped with the uneven illumination due to the location near the solar edge)\r\nPS: false color\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/t/o5RcKmFYaqmv1vK3",
