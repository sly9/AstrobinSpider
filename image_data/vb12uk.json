    "description": "Another chance to combine some older sensor data with data from the new sensor. While it is less than ideal, and I would much rather have this much data from the very clean chip, any little bit helps! Especially for very very dim structures like the outer halo of this galaxy, or the jet and shells of Cent A. My original edit of this was rather poor and never posted it, I think this version has really improved.",
