    "description": "Shot over two months earlier this year amid the worst summer for cloud and rain in recent memory; it wasn't until March that I finished the shooting. About 10.5hr made the cut, but a very large number of subs were discarded when cloud crept in and ended the fun. Now after a month or two of other commitments I have finally had a chance to process the data - pretty happy with the result! Played around with a couple of colour palettes - the blue version really appealed to me from an arty point of view, but the redder version definitely won out with far better rendering of the abundant Ha detail.\r\n\r\nAlways a spectacular target, it blows me away that this is a nebula in ANOTHER GALAXY! One of the real gifts of the Southern Sky, it's a real privelege to get to see it every year.  \r\n\r\nTaking a bit of a hiatus from imaging, processing some of this old data has been really fun. More to come...",
