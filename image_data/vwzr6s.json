    "description": "The favorable south-west libration is a great opportunity for lunarists to look at the East Sea, and although the formations at the edge are visible in a short perspective, the view of this edge sea is very exciting. The picture was created in good conditions and there are many details on it, the enumeration of which would make this fast indigestible, so I will limit myself to a few. Shown at the bottom of the image is a cleft (ditch) from which hardly observable hair-like structures extend. The entire inner rim of the pool is visible, which means that we can see as much as 13 degrees beyond the western edge of the moon. The mountains of the inner ring (Montes Rook) are shown very visually, moreover, two lava lakes are visible: the Lake of Spring and the Lake of Autumn. You can also see two medium-sized craters lying inside the pool - Maunder and Kopff.\r\nThe emergence of the youngest of the seas was associated with the demolition of the entire western hemisphere. In many places you can see traces of this impact paroxysm: partially buried old formations, wide gullies and light streaks.\r\n\r\nMultistacking (2000/20000).",
