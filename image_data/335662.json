    "description": "Well if you like galaxies in all shapes as sizes this will be something for you.\r\nFollowing on from my recent Markarian's chain here is an extended look into the wider Virgo cluster.  \r\nA range of lesser seen galaxies including M89 with its delicate shells, M90, M88 and M91.\r\nIn fact, there are some many galaxies in this image it makes the brain hurt - I will put an annotated version up for you to see :) \r\nHope you enjoy, this area of the sky for some reason seems very difficult to process (well for me anyway)  but it is a really nice area to look at purely out of interest.",
