    "description": "Messier 94 (also known as NGC 4736) is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici. M94 is one of the brightest galaxies within the M94 Group, a group of galaxies that contains between 16 and 24 galaxies. This group is one of many that lie within the Virgo Supercluster (i.e. the Local Supercluster). Although a large number of galaxies may be associated with M94, only a few galaxies near M94 appear to form a gravitationally bound system. Most of the other nearby galaxies appear to be moving with the expansion of the universe.\r\nThe distance estimate to M94 is 16.0 ± 1.3 Mly, and Its galactroc-centric velocity is 360 ± 3km/s.",
