    "description": "Due to consistently bad weather over the last two months I've re-processed the data from last year. I wanted to see whether the current processing workflow produces a better result. I definitely hope so!\r\n\r\nColor calibration has been done using AutoColor script in PixInsight.\r\n\r\nThe revision A has been rotated in order to view the Needle galaxy from the top. It looks as if a small NGC4562 chases the UFO (NGC4565) through the stars :)\r\n\r\nRevision B has been annotated using <a href=\"http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=ngc4565\">SIMBAD catalog</a>. It turned out that there are a few quasars in the field.\r\n\r\nHere is the old image:\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"https://astrob.in/8n7ddi/E/\"><img src=\"https://astrob.in/8n7ddi/E/rawthumb/gallery/get.jpg?insecure\" alt=\"NGC4565 The Needle. Beautiful as always\"/></a>.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\nVitali",
