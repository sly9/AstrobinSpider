    "description": "Recently I posted some close up images of the magnificent Jupiter, but showing longitudes that didn't include the Great Red Spot (GRS). More recently on the 13th August 2020 I had a narrow window of a single cloud free night, with the GRS well placed. Not only that the seeing was excellent. This image is basically north up, although once again I tilted the planet for aesthetic reasons.The NEB is remarkably chopped up. The NNTeB has quite a long reddish brown barge on the p side of the CM near the limb.\r\n\r\nThe image has really good resolution of the GRS, which can be seen to have a quite dark but small central part. There is an annular section with a more orange colour and outside that a darker ring that curls around to two small  lighter coloured ovals on the f side. Outside this there is an amount of red material which I presume is a remnant of the latest flake activity. There are also two dark areas just on the p side of the GRS in the RSH.\r\n\r\nThe Oval BA shows distortion as it approaches the GRS and it exhibits some interesting dark structure as an internal ring, although the periphery is very white.\r\n\r\nThe complex wake of the GRS has large regular shaped and decaying eddies.",
