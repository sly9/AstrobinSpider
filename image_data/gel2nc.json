    "description": "This is the other object shot at 2nd half of the night. Star shape is quite challenge on corners using FSQ-85 with 0.73x reducer. The larger frame of 16200 chip made it worse.  Also misplaced 1.5 mm unwanted spacer didn't help.  I realized it after whole session is completed:-)  Other than this drawback,  I am happy with the result. \r\n\r\nNights:  \r\n10/1/2020, 10/2/2020, 10/3/2020, 10/4/2020, 10/5/2020, 10/6/2020, 10/7/2020, 10/9/2020, 10/10/2020, 10/11/2020, 10/12/2020, 10/13/2020, 10/14/2020\r\n\r\n\r\nSubs:\r\nha:  22x1800s\r\no3:  30x1800s\r\ns2:   20x1800s\r\nr/g/b: 60sx30 each",
