    "description": "This was one I have been working on for quite some time, but I am glad I spent the extra time with it. This data really helped this target shine, I think much more so than the SHO version of the image. However, I think that is just my fault. Seeing the end result of this image has just made me want to go back and really improve upon the SHO version after seeing what the LRGB was capable of!\r\n\r\nWhat surprised me more than anything though, was the inclusion of the SNR 1987A, a small target even for Hubble. While this image of course lacked the detail of Hubble, you can still clearly see it from its intense magenta.",
