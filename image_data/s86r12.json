    "description": "This one is an attempt at this quite faint nebula... As always I've never had enough time to make a proper exposure time but, instead, I've managed to include several sessions done along the years plus I've included exposures that my good friend Maurizio Mollica gave me. His setup was using a refractor scope (a Takahashi TSA 102) and the night He made his exposures was not the best one in terms of seeing. Mine too has different quality in terms of good seeing or trasparency sometimes thus the final image has \"strange\" stars a little bit bloated... Anyway the overall result seems quite interesting and I've decided to publish it. My exposures where acquired mostly with my moving setup with the Takahashi Epsilon 210 f3 and QSI 683 WSG8. Total integration time including Maurizio's frames is about 7 hours total.",
