    "description": "Gum 15 is a nebula from the Gum catalog, located in the constellation of Vela, around 3,000 light-years away from Earth.\r\n\r\nIt is shaped by aggressive winds flowing from the stars within and around it.\r\n\r\nThe bright star in the center of the nebula is HD74804, a double star.\r\n\r\nCaptured using the Telescope Live CHI-1 astrograph located at the El Sauce Observatory in the Rio Hurtado Valley in Chile, South America, the final result comprises 19hrs 20mins of broadband data.\r\n\r\nPost-processing was carried out using PixInsight with final colour corrections being made in Adobe Photoshop.",
