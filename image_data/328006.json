    "description": "I've always wanted to capture the Heart Nebula since the first time I've seen it a few years ago. Such a beautiful object, especially in SHO.\r\n\r\nI finally got a full set of narrowband filters last fall and set out to capture this object. But I ran into a dilemma. My scope is too long! I would have to do a 4 panel mosaic to capture the whole Heart Nebula. So I was left with a choice whether to split my integration among the 4 panes or go deep on, in my opinion, the most interesting region of the Heart. I opted for the latter, and I'm glad I did.\r\n\r\nIt took me forever to gather all the subs for this image due to the horrible weather we have here in California these past few months. Since I don't have a permanent setup yet, I have to set up and tear down every session. So I really dislike those \"clear nights\" with terrible seeings. With so few clear nights this time of the year, I just had to put in the effort to setup and try only to end up with a couple of usable subs.\r\n\r\nProcessing also took awhile since this is my first full narrowband SHO image. Just so many things to learn and try out, but it was all worth it in the end because I'm quite happy with how the image turned out.\r\n\r\nHappy New Year everyone!",
