    "description": "Never had a go at this object before but as clear skies have recently coincided with near full moon I needed to shoot a region with a lot of ionized hydrogen, so I decided to try this well known nebula. I shot the exposures during a cold spell in January and February with temperatures dropping as low as -25C so I practically didn't need to cool the ccd at all. And my neighbor the wolf seems to have returned. Saw fresh tracks when leaving the observatory in the forest at 05 in the morning. Cool.",
