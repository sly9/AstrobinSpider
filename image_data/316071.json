    "description": "Mapped Ha, OIII, SII to Red, Blue, Yellow.\r\n\r\nThe Bubble Nebula is seven light-years across and resides 7,100 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia.\r\n\r\nThe seething star forming this nebula is 45 times more massive than our sun. Gas on the star gets so hot that it escapes away into space as a “stellar wind” moving at over four million miles per hour. This outflow sweeps up the cold, interstellar gas in front of it, forming the outer edge of the bubble much like a snowplow piles up snow in front of it as it moves forward.\r\n\r\nAs the surface of the bubble's shell expands outward, it slams into dense regions of cold gas on one side of the bubble. This asymmetry makes the star appear dramatically off-center from the bubble.\r\n\r\nThe gases heated to varying temperatures emit different colors: oxygen is hot enough to emit blue light in the bubble near the star, while the cooler pillars are yellow from the combined light of hydrogen and nitrogen. The Bubble Nebula \"pillars\" are being illuminated by the strong ultraviolet radiation from the brilliant star inside the bubble.\r\n\r\nThe Bubble Nebula was discovered in 1787 by William Herschel, a prominent British astronomer. It is being formed by an O star, BD +60º2522, an extremely bright, massive, and short-lived star that has lost most of its outer hydrogen and is now fusing helium into heavier elements. The star is about four million years old, and in 10 million to 20 million years, it will likely detonate as a supernova.",
