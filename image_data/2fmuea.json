    "description": "This one is a bit off-season, but I had some data from last year of which I had only processed a center crop of the pillars. This time, I tackled the full FOV, which shows the eagle with its open wings. It is a Hubble palette composition, with a total of 20 hours, split as SHO (8.6:4.2:7.1). Acquired with an 6.6-inch AP refractor, and a QHY600, from suburban skies. In the processing I was very careful with the stars, to avoid distracting halos.",
