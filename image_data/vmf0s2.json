    "description": "My final backyard image for the season is this five panel mosaic of Integrated Flux Nebulosity (IFN) one hour west of the Fish Hook Nebula (Mandel-Wilson 5). The structures have no names or designations as far as I know so I decided to call them The Predator-Prey Nebula. The prey is that frightened looking central structure and the predator is the staghorn beetle like stucture coming up from lower right. Apart from being faintly visible on Aladin Sky Atlas (DSS red data) I have not seen any images of these very faint but gigant structures (about 60 moons would fit into this 6Â° wide image) in the outskirts of our galaxy, primarily lit up by the collective radiation from the galaxy.\r\n\r\nThe image has been downsampled from 10670 x 7931 pixels.",
