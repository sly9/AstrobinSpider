    "description": "The Tarantula Nebula, NGC 2070, is a large H II region in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It lies at the eastern end of the LMC's stellar bar.\r\n\r\nNGC 2070 is the largest and brightest emission nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and one of the largest emission nebulae known. The Tarantula Nebula has an apparent magnitude of 8. Considering its distance of about 160,000 light years, it is so bright that if it were as close to Earth as the Orion Nebula, the Tarantula Nebula would cast shadows.\r\n\r\nThe nebula resides on the leading edge of the Large Magellanic Cloud, where the compression of the interstellar medium likely results in a very active star formation region. In fact, it is the most active starburst region known in the Local Group of galaxies. Although the Tarantula is roughly 100 times larger than the famous Orion Nebula, it is illuminated in the same way: by the ultraviolet radiation from a collection of hot, young, massive stars embedded within it. \r\n\r\nVisually close to NGC 2070 is an open cluster NGC 2100 (shown to the left side on the image, eastern side on the sky).",
