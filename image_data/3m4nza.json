    "description": "This star cluster is located in the constellation Cabellera de Berenice, this cluster is very well accompanied by countless galaxies, given the FOV of the image we can see them planted around this star cluster, giving the impression that they are very small, this It is one of the regions that hosts a large number of galaxies, along with the constellations of Virgo and Leo. We are going to list some of those galazies, The Needle Galaxy (NGC 4665), The Koi Fish Galaxy (NGC 4559), NGC 4555, 4274, 4283, 4278 ... Without a doubt this is one of those images to observe carefully and every time If you look at it, you may see a new galaxy. This open cluster is one of the closest to us, it is only 260 a.l. away.",
