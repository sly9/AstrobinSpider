    "description": "Well 5 and half hours on the Flaming Star Nebula \r\n\r\nDone a lot of attempts on this , not got anything that really happy with \r\n\r\nCapture of the HA and Sii in the nebula was good but Oiii was virtually not there other than stars \r\n\r\nAlthough a SHO image so final picture lacking in blue \r\n\r\nTreatment of stars very poor ... need to do better on this \r\n\r\nBut still a lot better than my previous version at 800mm using my DSLR !",
