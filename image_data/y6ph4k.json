    "description": "I started photographing Barnard dark nebula, a bit like Iris Nebula, back in October, but I haven't encountered so much critical weather yet, so after 400 + some expos, I finished exposing the subject. Plus, during processing, the stacking was also stubborn and the flat didn't fix much (although it was good), and then I felt that it wouldn't be a spectacular topic, but I didn't give up and in the end this picture was made.",
