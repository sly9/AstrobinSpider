    "description": "This project took most of the summer but, for me, it was worth it. For the past few years, I have imaged the Iris, and I've wanted to do a mosaic of the region with the Ghost nebula in it as well. \r\n\r\n2-panel mosaic: 97x300s L, 120x300s RGB for each.\r\nTotal exposure: 36 Hours.",
