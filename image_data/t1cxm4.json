    "description": "Astronomy gives you nights you'll never forget.  After a sunny day on the beach in late April 2016, I drove up the volcano Haleakala on Maui on a moonless night to find temps in the 30s and 20 mph winds.  Watching the milky way rise on its side out of the horizon was an amazing sight I don't get in Utah.  With the winds, I'm lucky this panorama turned out usable.  I was just starting to do astrophotography and didn't have a star tracker (it probably wouldn't have worked well anyway with the winds). The shot has plenty of imperfections but it's one of my favorite pictures because it's one of my favorite memories.  Mars takes center stage near Antares with Saturn nearby.  Alpha Centauri and the Carina Nebula are visible just above the horizon to the right. You can see Mauna Kea 80 miles away in the distance along with the lights of the big island.",
