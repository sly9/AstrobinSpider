    "description": "Lightning is a bit of a stretch from Astroimaging, but in my defense Jupiter did pop out on the right a few frames later.\r\n\r\nThe storm was little more than 10 miles away but was completely silent - the dividing line of the clouds was right over my head, and the northern sky was completely clear. I wish I had a large mirror with me, I could have gotten stars trails from the reflected ground and lightning to the south.\r\n\r\nEdit: Looks like the aquisition details don't show up when you select \"other.\" This is a stack of a half dozen 120\" exposures taken at ISO 200, 18mm, and F/11 using a Canon 450D and a kit 18-55mm lens",
