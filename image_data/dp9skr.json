    "description": "I spent four spectacular nights photographing the Yellowstone National Park. Made all my plans for the night captures during the day, scouting the potential places and returning to shoot at night. The Park is simply gorgeous in day time, but at night it unveils a whole new perspective. Enchanting!\r\n.\r\nThe magic of one of the most spectacular night skies I have ever seen was mesmerizing. Zero light pollution. The conjunction between Cosmos and Nature is prestine there.\r\n.\r\nGetting out of the car to photograph was a doorway which lead to an experience filled with ancestral vibes.\r\n\r\nps: beware bears and bison (on the road)! ðŸ˜…\r\n.\r\n. .\r\n[ Tech Specs ]\r\n.\r\n24-70mm lens | Canon 6D (Ha mod) | ISO 3200 | f4 | Portable EQ Mount | Exposure time : 70\" secs | 1 shot for the sky, 1 shot for the ground | Two images taken in inmidiate sequence, forming a vertical panorama;\r\n.\r\nProcessing software: Pixinsight | PTGui | PS",
