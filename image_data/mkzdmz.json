    "description": "A great target of the southern skies, was almost worried we would only do it in LRGB! Glad to have gotten a chance to double back to it a few months later and pick up some narrowband. \r\n\r\nI made a ton of iterations on the colors for this (13 tries!), but ultimately, I think this classic scheme is what ended up looking the best. I am absolutely happy with the dynamicness of the image though, one thing I feel my narrowband images generally lack. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking, clear skies :)",
