    "description": "More experimentation with starnet++ neural net application.  This is a 5 segment hydrogen alpha mosaic covering bright portions of Barnard's loop  in Orion.   Image tiles were processed, star removed, then combined into the mosaic panorama as a final step.   The software does an excellent job on small stars, in very wide field images, while preserving subtail in the overall image.",
