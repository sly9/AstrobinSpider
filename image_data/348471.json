    "description": "NGC 2264; Cone nebula / Christmas tree cluster / Fox fur nebula\r\n\r\nMulti channel (HaRGB) process in Astro Pixel Processor and final editing in PS \r\n\r\nNGC 2264 consists of 3 main objects\r\n\r\n1. Cone Nebula ; at the top of the image. This nebula is a famous H II region located in the constellation Monoceros. It lies at an approximate distance of 2,700 light years from Earth and is located in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way. The giant pillar of gas and dust was named for its conical shape, which is a result of a dark nebula absorbing the light of an emission nebula that lies behind it. The faint emission nebula is illuminated by the star S Monocerotis, the brightest member of the NGC 2264 cluster \r\n\r\n2. Christmas tree Cluster; below the Cone nebula. The Christmas Tree Cluster was named for its triangular shape, formed by a cluster of very young stars,  that looks like a tree in visible light. It is located in the northern part of NGC 2264, just below the Cone Nebula\r\n\r\n3. The Fox Fur Nebula;  this nebula contains enormous quantities of interstellar dust and gas, which are illuminated by the massive young stars that are being formed within the nebula’s thick clouds. The nebula’s red glow is a result of hydrogen gas being stimulated to emit its own light by the strong ultraviolet radiation from the massive, young, hot blue stars in the cluster. The nebula’s blue areas are composed mainly of clouds of dust that reflect the blue light of the young stars.",
