    "description": "NGC7331 is one of the finest galaxies in the sky for both imaging and visual observation. It is about 40 million light years distant in the constellation Pegasus. Four companion galaxies can be seen above the main galaxy in this photo: NGC7335, NGC7336, NGC7337, and NGC7340, and together with NGC7331 the group is sometimes called the Deer Lick Group. The association is optical rather than real, as the smaller galaxies are much further away at approximately 300 to 350 million light years. There are other distant galaxies visible in the photo as well.",
