    "description": "During Mercury transit I took a photo with a strange phenomena. I send it to Les Cowley from https://www.atoptics.co.uk/ to check it. He asked me to need a second opinion and sent it to Professor Young in California as an expert on mirages and atmospheric refraction.\r\n\r\nAnd there was some good news for me from Les:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Dear Amir,\r\n\r\nI have good news. Andrew Young has confirmed that your peculiar green feature above the sunâ€™s upper limb was real. Not a camera or processing artefact.\r\n\r\nThe effect probably arose from a combination of (1) optical ducting from a weak temperature inversion (2) your position relative to the duct and (3) the hazy Tehran atmosphere.\r\n\r\nDucting is a phenomenon where a temperature inversion causes sunset rays to be refracted up and down and so travel considerable distances. More about ducts here:\r\nhttps://www.atoptics.co.uk/fza150.htm\r\n\r\nDucts produce images and green flashes. The appearance of them depends on your altitude and the height of the temperature inversion/duct.\r\n\r\nWhat you imaged is a type of sub-duct refraction seen when you are just below the duct. It would only have lasted a few seconds which accounts for it not showing on your other images. It is very rare.\"",
