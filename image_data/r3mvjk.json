    "description": "The 'Whale' (NGC 4631) is an edge-on spiral galaxy located 25 million light years away in Canes Venatici. Sitting above is the small companion (NGC 4627). Below and to the left is another edge-on spiral known as the 'Hockey Stickâ€™ (NGC 4656) which is around 30 million light years distant. \r\n\r\nSteve and Barry have recently photographed the Whale and Hockey Stick using their Takahashi FSQ106 rig in Spain.  This spurred me on to consider whether capturing the same galaxies using our Esprit 120/Moravian G2-8300 setup at home would give a slightly more detailed view of the galaxies (Pixel resolution 1.33 vs 2.1).  I started capturing the data for this image on 27 March and finished on 21 April 2020.  I tried 3 frames of Ha on the first night of capture as an experiment to see if it would be worthwhile trying to get a few hours of Ha.  There was more visible than I was expecting so I pressed on with it on our next clear night (2 April) as in any event there was really too much moon about to shoot broadband.  In the end I managed to get a total of 24 frames of Ha in addition to more broadband frames than we usually manage at home - we have had an unusual number of clear nights here!  \r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Sky-Watcher Esprit 120ED\r\nCamera: Moravian G2-8300\r\nFilters: Chroma (Ha), Baader (LRGB)\r\nMount: Mesu 200\r\n\r\nLum: 53 x 600s\r\nRed: 24 x 600s\r\nGreen 24 x 600s\r\nBlue: 24 x 600s\r\nHa: 24 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 28 hours and 50 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData: Elisabeth Milne & Steve Milne \r\n\r\nProcessing: Elisabeth Milne\r\n\r\nThe image has been cropped square as this seemed to give a more pleasing presentation.",
