    "description": "I know airglow can be a nuisance for astrophotography, but for nightscapes and widefields, it can be absolutely stunning. I lucked out (for a nightscape at least) this night as the airglow was so bright, you could see it with the unaided eye (a first for me). While this image is a tracked-blend, I took some singles (sky and foreground to be made into a pano without tracking) shortly after sunset with a crescent moon setting and the camera pulled out the airglow! What a fascinating night (minus the trek back down in the dark with \"bear activity\" signs everywhere). \r\n\r\nImage details:\r\n\r\nSky: 7 image panorama with the A7riii and Sony 24mm f1.4 GM @ 1.6, iso 1250, 83s vertical\r\nForground: 6 images with A7riii and Sony 24mm f1.4 GM @ 2.8, iso 1600, 204s horizontal",
