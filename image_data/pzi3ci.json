    "description": "The data for this image was collected with a TOA 130 and ASI 1600 (about 32.5 hours) and a Planewave 12\" CDk (about 32 hours).  It is an L(Ha)R(Ha)GB composition.  I felt this image deserved its own posting separate from my other IC-342 image as it is a wholly different scale--a different image really.  Due to the difference in scale I registered all data to the Planewave red stack, and ended up binning the image 2x2 in software as the resolution was between .6 and .7 arcsec/pix, which is too high for my sky--though the planewave was used at a pretty dark sight.    I was surprised to see that my data, was sharper than the planewave, though the planewave was cleaner.  Therefore, I ended up rescaling my original image and blending it 50-50 with the new image.  That seemed to impart the sharpness to an otherwise clean data set.  I was also surprised to see that despite the  ammount of data--no additional faint extensions of the galaxy were to be found--in fact I think I lost a bit.  I guess galaxies to have an edge after all.\r\n\r\nI would be interested in hearing opinions about this image compared to my original--can they be compared?  If so, which is preferred.  Its hard to argue with the scale--unless one prefers a bit of FOV.  I find myself torn.  In the end I decided that they can't be compared and decided to post it on its own.\r\n\r\nData Acquisition -  Rodd Dryfoos and Rick Kuntz\r\nProcessing - Rodd Dryfoos",
