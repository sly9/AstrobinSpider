    "description": "This is shot using equipment shared by me and Dhaval Bhrambatt in Marathon, Texas.\r\n\r\nMy main objective with this setup was to go after small target and focus mainly on resolution. However, this target almost filled up the FOV, leaving very little wiggle room to crop. I love interacting pairs and this one has very interesting structure due to the encounter.  The dark dust of NGC4438 is especially interesting. \r\n\r\nI had major issues completing this image. My OAG somehow lost focus and I had to use large , barely selectable star to guide. In addition, with frequent storms, the only time I managed to image was with quarter moon up in the sky near the target. I mostly got 5 minute subs instead of the usual 10 min. \r\n\r\nThe resolution looks good but due  the small FOV at this focal length, there is no place to hide issues :) . I really should look into larger chip to get more breathing room.  \r\n\r\nProcessed in Pixinsight and tweaked in photoshop.",
