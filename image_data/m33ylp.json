    "description": "Have had this one sitting around all winter long but finally decided to tackle it. I tried to enhance the dark clouds obscuring the nebula and especially like the \"smudge\" across the middle of the Cygnus Wall structure that looks like a wet brush has been dragged across the middle of a watercolor painting. Also tried to keep the deep blue glow present just above and to the left of the \"wall.\" I captured far more Sulphur data on this one and I think it helped bring out some of the more detailed structures in the object.\r\n\r\nData gathered August 2020.",
