    "description": "NGC1531 and NGC1532 are a pair of interacting galaxies in Eridanus, approximately 50 million light-years away.  The larger NGC1532 is an edge-on spiral, disrupted by its smaller companion. They were first observed by  James Dunlop in October 1826 from Parramatta, west of Sydney.",
