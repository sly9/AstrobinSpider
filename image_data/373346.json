    "description": "IPHASX J015624.9+652830 (also known as Ferrero 6) is the final image in my ‘trio of faint targets’ this fall. IPHASX J015624.9+652830 is a ridiculously faint planetary nebula in Cassiopeia spectroscopically confirmed by Laurence Sabin as part of the IPHAS survey in 2011 and independently discovered by amateur astronomer Laurent Ferrero in 2013 using plates of the Digitized Sky Survey. To date, I’ve only been able to find four other versions of this target (all of which were shot with CCDs): <a href=\"http://www.pbase.com/jshuder/image/154101251\">Jim Shuder’s version</a> using a C9.25 EdgeHD, <a href=\"http://www.frank-slotosch-astroseite.de/ferrero_6.html\">Frank Slotosch’s version</a> using an 8” Newtonian, <a href=\"https://www.spektrum.de/alias/wunder-des-weltalls/ferrero-6-fe6/1421368\">Sascha Schueller’s version</a> using a 16” f/4 Newtonian and 0.73x reducer and <a href=\"https://www.hansonastronomy.com/ferrero-6-fe-6-pn-g1296034/\">Mark Hanson’s utterly epic version</a> in November of 2017 using a 24” Planewave. If there’s another version you happen to be aware of that I haven’t found, let me know so I can add it to this list.\r\n\r\nEdits: \r\nJust wanted to add <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/376554/>Pat Rodgers' image</a> to this list. \r\nAlso wanted to add <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/399133/>Jerry Macon's image</a> to the list.\r\nAdding <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/6y78qk/>Peter Goodhew's epic version</a> to the list.\r\nAdding <a href=https://www.astrobin.com/tgxewh/>Andreas' (equinoxx) image</a> to the list.\r\nAdding <a href=https://www.szlaci.hu/gal/galeria.php?kod=216>Szeri László's image</a> from June 8, 2019, which I randomly found today (11/17/2019).\r\n\r\nWhile the OIII signal in PuWe1 is undoubtedly weaker than either the Ha or OIII signal in IPHASX J015624.9+652830 (Fe 6), the Ha signal in PuWe1 seems to be a good deal stronger, making this (probably) the faintest target I’ve ever done. I doubt more integration time would help me pull out anything more on this. A 30-hour stack looked like a single sub of other planetary nebulae I’ve worked on.",
