    "description": "I really wanted to enhance the stars of my previous version, so I made some RGB  20 subs of 60s exposure for each R,V, B, just to get the stars and colors.\r\nI used Starnet++ and Photoshop to clean out the stars of the SHO image.\r\n\r\nSo this is the new version with colors of the version A and B mixed , and RGB Stars shape and colors. \r\n\r\n6 nights : 16/17, 26, 30 September , 3, 5/6 and 26 October,\r\n\r\n54 SII Subs @300s (gain 139, -20°C)\r\n63 OIII Subs @300s (gain 139, -20°C)\r\n104 HalphaSubs @300s (gain 139, -20°C)\r\n=> 221 subs @300s about 18.4 hours of exposure\r\n\r\n20 Blue subs @180s gain zero and -20°C\r\n20 Green subs @180s gain zero and -20°C\r\n20 Red subs @180s gain zero and -20°C\r\n=> 60 subs @180s about 1 hours of exposure",
