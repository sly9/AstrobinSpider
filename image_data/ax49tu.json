    "description": "I recently swapped my Coronado PST for a used Lunt 60T Ha solar scope.  The difference in detail between the bigger aperture, blocking filter and pressure tuning vs tilt tuning are pretty amazing.  This was my first attempt at imaging through the scope (only 2nd day out with it), following mainly online tutorials for processing.  I'm really impressed with what it was able to get, especially since it was a pretty boring day on the Sun, according to Space Weather.\r\n\r\nI can't wait for the Solar cycle to start gaining speed so I can see what this thing can do with a Sun more active with spots, filaments and proms.\r\n\r\nThis was the best 15% of 3000 frames for the disk, the best 30% of 3000 frames for the proms.  Exposure time ~5-12ms for each.",
