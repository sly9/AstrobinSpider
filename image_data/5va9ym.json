    "description": "NGC 7380 is a young open cluster of stars in the northern circumpolar constellation of Cepheus, discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1787. The surrounding emission nebulosity is known colloquially as the Wizard Nebula.\r\n\r\nThe cluster spans ~20 light-years at a distance of 8,500 light-years.\r\n\r\nThis object has been captured using a QHY600 60 Megapixel Full Frame Monochrome CMOS camera mounted on a Takahashi 130 FSQ. Data acquired by Terry Hancock from <a href=\"https://grandmesaobservatory.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Grand Mesa Observatory</a>.\r\n\r\nHubble Palette version (SHO): H-Alpha mapped to green, SII mapped to red and OIII mapped to the blue channel. while the colors in this image are not the true colors, the narrowband filters were used create the nebula color. Then I added the natural star colors using RGB filters and Starnet process.\r\n\r\nRA: 22h 47m 21.0s\r\nDEC: +58Â° 07' 54\"\r\nLocation: Cepheus\r\nDistance: 8.5 kly\r\nMagnitude: 7.2\r\n\r\nAcquisition October 2020\r\nTotal acquisition time of 11.6 hours.\r\n\r\nTechnical Details\r\nData acquisition:  Terry HANCOCK\r\nProcessing: Nicolas ROLLAND\r\nLocation: The Grand Mesa Observatory, Whitewater, CO\r\nR 13 x 300 sec\r\nG 12 x 300 sec\r\nB 8 x 300 sec\r\nHa 17 x 600 sec\r\nOIII 17 x 600 sec\r\nSII 19 x 600 sec\r\nOptics: Takahashi 130 FSQ @ F5\r\nMount: Paramount ME\r\nCCD: QHY600M CMOS\r\nPre Processing: CCDstack & Pixinsight\r\nPost Processing: Photoshop CC",
