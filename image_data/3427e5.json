    "description": "First dark sky test of the 10\" ONTC Newtonian.\r\nSeeing was poor for the most part so I had to pick a subset of frames to pull out details in the brighter part of the galaxy. \r\nI added a few hours of Ha from the backyard to bring out the jets. It helped but not as much as I hoped.\r\nThe other small galaxies in this field are lovely due to the variety of shapes and colors.",
