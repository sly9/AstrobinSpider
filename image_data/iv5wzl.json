    "description": "This is a false color image shot using Sii, Ha, Oiii filters and combined in what is known as the hubble pallet. In total accounting for just over 20 hours of exposure time capture on the nights of Feb 21, 22, 26, March 7, 8, 20, 21, 22, and 23.\n\nThe Heart Nebula, lies some 7500 light years away from Earth and is located in the Perseus Arm of our Galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. It was discovered by William Herschel on 3 November 1787. It is an emission nebula showing glowing ionized hydrogen gas and darker dust lanes.\n\nThe brightest part of the nebula (a knot at its western edge) is separately classified as NGC 896, because it was the first part of the nebula to be discovered. The nebula's intense output and its morphology are driven by the radiation emanating from a small group of stars near the nebula's center. This open cluster of stars, known as Collinder 26 or Melotte 15, contains a few bright stars nearly 50 times the mass of our Sun, and many more dim stars that are only a fraction of our Sun's mass.\n<Wikipedia>",
