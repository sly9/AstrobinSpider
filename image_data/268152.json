    "description": "My first narrowband image... :)\r\nCrescent Nebula and surroundings.\r\nThe Crescent Nebula looks like emerges from space. Was created by the brightest star we can find in the middle. A Wolf-Rayet star.\r\nOn the rest of the image we find huge amounts of ionized hydrogen. On the bottom we see a planetary nebula discovered by an amateur astronomer on 2008.\r\nTech details:\r\nSky-Watcher NEQ 6 Pro tuned by HAS, Takahashi FSQ-106N, Moravian G2-8300 with Baader filters. 24*1800s HA + 24*1800s OIII bin 1x1. HOO Palette. Taken from my home observatory in Valencia (SPAIN).\r\nHope you like it...",
