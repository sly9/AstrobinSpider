    "description": "As always, I don't know how many times I've started taking exposures on that subject and, as always, I've never finished a session having enough datas... Recently I went to a star party (last year) and I've collected two nights of exposures with my Takahashi Epsilon 210 that I've used as a basis for the image. I've added two more sessions on tha same subject coming from two past starcamp and I've made the luminance funation for the final image. Since the Tak Epsilon has a rotating focuser, many images comes in different rotations and, as a result, You will see many non perfectly superimposing spikes... I then added many other datas coming from different setups (telescopes and cameras) gathered during the years. The final image is a composit of all these attemts at differnt scales and resolution and suffers of different SNR (specially the bottom right corner is the worst part and lack in SNR and color due to poor datas on that spot...). The final image has been edited in a film (meaning motion picture) compositing software handling 64Bit HDR images and Photoshop also used in HDR in the attempt of a most \"dramatic\" rendering of the area... Total integration time is about 18/20 hours including some Halpha (about 2 hours). Anyway, this is the final result.\r\n\r\nThanks",
