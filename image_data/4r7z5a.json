    "description": "Part of the Perseus Molecular Cloud. While other pictures of this area have the center of the FOV more towards LBN 749, I have choosen to have Atik near the FOV center. This results in a picture showing not only B 3, B 4 and B5, but having the molecular cloud almost diagonal across the FOV. Still the picture is dominated by bright Gingrich 1 (aka IC 348) and the beautiful LBN 749, a mix of HA and reflecting nebulae.\r\n\r\nThe image might be a bit over processed. It suffers from less than optimal conditions while collecting part of data (very high humidity, maybe even some very thin high clouds). Besides that, I hope you enjoy it.",
