    "description": "Not being wholly satisfied with my M33 taken with the ASI 1600, or my M33 taken with the STT-8300 (both with the TOA 130) I decided to combine the data to see if improvement could be realized.  I know some Ha regions are a bit loud (its hard to isolate them without the Ha master), and perhaps saturation is too high overall.  I only had the JPEG data for the STT-8300, so its probably not quite what it could be.",
