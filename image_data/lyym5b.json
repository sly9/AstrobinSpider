    "description": "While looking for a planetary nebula to image that would be of reasonable size for my Skywatcher 120, I came across Abell35  and although having a very low surface brightness, I thought it might be a good challenging object. I had never heard of a Stromgren sphere until I started reading about this target and was surprised to read that the Rosette nebula was also an example of a Stromgren sphere. I also thought the \"bow wave\" in front and wrapping around the sides of the central star was also an interesting feature.\r\nThis is most integration time I have spent on an object so far and after seeing the individual 20 min Ha and OIII subs, I was concerned that I would have little to show for all the time spent but was pleasantly surprised by the  amount of detail I was able to capture.",
