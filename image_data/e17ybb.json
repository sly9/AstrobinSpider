    "description": "This picture started from a classic capture of the Chromosphere, in H-alpha frequency, of the active area AR 12737, with his main spot.\r\nI noticed that the network of magnetic field lines, generated at the Chromosphere level, might be approximated  by midlines of the filaments lied around the main spot because, in fact, the filaments are driven right by the local magnetic field lines. So, I used a proprietary software, able to compute the midlines of each filament, these median lines having the thickness proportional to the size of the real filaments and  being placed in space by the magnetic field lines positions. \r\nThe result was this wonderful network of lines that successfully approximate the magnetic field lines, like position, orientation, and intensity. \r\n Also, I insisted on keeping the deepness effect of the lines, by specific processing, using the various shadow intensity on various levels.\r\nFinishing with using false colors as close to the H-alpha specific color but keeping the hot points  which marks more active areas.",
