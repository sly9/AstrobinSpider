    "description": "I've had equal amounts of fun and frustration processing this target deciding on the final colour palette of the nebula, which from reading is a reflection nebula with the light from a nearby star scattering to a red/orange colour (see APOD 9 March 2012: \"But unlike the Trifid, in NGC 1579 the reddish glow is not emission from clouds of glowing hydrogen gas excited by ultraviolet light from a nearby hot star. Instead, the dust in NGC 1579 drastically diminishes, reddens, and scatters the light from an embedded, extremely young, massive star, itself a strong emitter of the characteristic red hydrogen alpha light.\").  We imaged this target as an early evening target before slewing off to our main two panel mosaic which we are still imaging.  The first few subs were collected on 23rd October and the last on the 1st January 2020.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia: \"NGC 1579 (also known as the Northern Trifid) is a diffuse nebula located in the constellation of Perseus. It is referred to as the Northern Trifid because of its similar appearance to the Trifid Nebula, which is located in the southern celestial hemisphere of the sky. It is a H II region, a region of star formation.[4] The star cluster contains the emission-line star LkHÎ± 101, which provides much of the ionizing radiation in the nebula.[5] NGC 1579 lies within a giant molecular cloud known as the California Molecular Cloud.\"\r\n\r\nData acquisition: Barry Wilson & Steve Milne\r\nProcessing: Barry Wilson",
