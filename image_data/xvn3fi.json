    "description": "I've become a bit of slave to this high resolution mosaic of Milky Way project I'm working on, a 35 panel monstrosity shot with an ASI2600mc Pro and Voigtlander 110mm APO Lanther lens. So far I've acquired 23 of the panels, each panel consisting of 40-45 subs at 1 minute, gain 100, and f2.5. Using the AZ-GTi mount with everything controlled by the ASIAir Pro has made the acquisition portion quite easy thankfully. The hard part is the very long and very repetitive process of image calibration, stacking, stretching, etc etc. I put 20 of the panels together, it's very difficult getting a consistent background extraction and stretch through every panel and the amount of post processing work is taxing to say the least. I'm mostly happy with the progress so far, I'm going to reevaluate after 30 panels and see if I've covered enough area of the sky to be happy with that. \r\n\r\nSo far I'm up over 200gb of total storage used, the 20 panel stitched photoshop document is nearly 30gb itself! So far my custom built PC has been up to the task with the basic editing I've done, even with the total resolution now exceeding 35,000x30,000 pixels (finally moved past 1 gigapixel)! Final resolution should be on the order of 55,000x30,000 pixels. Looking forward to getting this wrapped up in the next month if I can get 2 more nights of clear skies, then moving on to the next project. Unfortunately this low res version does no justice to the detail and quality of the overall image.",
