    "description": "I was unable to realize the project to image the Moon-Mars conjunction of September 6, 2020 at the end of the night. \r\nHowever, in order to keep a memory of this event, I created a composition, as faithful as possible, using two images.\r\nThe one on Mars was taken on September 4, 2020, two days before the conjunction and therefore has almost the same relief (we can recognize Terra Cimmeria).\r\nThe lunar image dates from April 3, 2020. It corresponds to the northern region of our satellite \"flown\" by Mars on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe proportions are respected as well as the apparent distance Moon-Mars.",
