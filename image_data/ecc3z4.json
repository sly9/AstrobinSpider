    "description": "With all the rain this year, May turned out to be May Not, and imaging nights were scarce. I used this brief window to add more data to an M82 session a couple of months ago. I mistakenly thought the earlier frames were taken vertically, so my framing was way off and I had to crop a lot. It turned out OK, but my processing was a little rough and the stars are more bloated than they should be.",
