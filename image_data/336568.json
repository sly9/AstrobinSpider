    "description": "Finally had a chance to complete the data collection and this image after re-fielding the 8\" F/2.6 Astrograph. \r\n\r\nThe astrograph used here is my own optical design, I ground and polished all of the optics, 8\" objective asphere, 10\" flat fold mirror with central hole. 10\" primary mirror asphere, and both lenses for the cemented doublet field lens. A local machine shop did the metal machining, and I used a Clement primary mirror focuser. The tube is a passive athermal design of my own, and the entire OTA was constructed in my garage. \r\n\r\nThe system, when used in the field , employed home made electronics and control software, a portable UPS system, small field weather station, and SQM for site survey data collection. The electronics and control software for the observatory are home made as well.\r\n\r\nThe data for this image has been collected over several seasons starting in 2012. \r\n\r\nThis image is a combination of data collected using several scenarios:\r\n     1).  camping data taken near Black Rock Ranger Station in the Sierra Nevada mountains at 9,000' SQ 21.9. 2012\r\n     2).  on site data during construction of my observatory at 6350' SQ 21.83, 2013\r\n     3).  remote data taken once the observatory was complete, controlled from 220 miles distant. SQ 21.87, 2018\r\n\r\nNorth is to the left.\r\n\r\nI  used Astronomik RGB, OIII, and Halpha for camping and construction  integration scenarios.  Then used Astrodon RGB, Halpha for the remote integrations.",
