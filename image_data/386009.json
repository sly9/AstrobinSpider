    "description": "IC 59 and IC 63 are emission nebulae located around 600 light years away in the constellation of Cassiopeia.  Both nebulae are being ionized by the nearby (3-4 light years) star Gamma Cass - the star that forms the centre point of the ‘W’ (sometimes referred to as ‘Navi’).\r\n\r\nBecause of its distinctive shape IC 63 is often referred to as the ‘Ghost Nebula’ or even the ‘The Ghost of Cassiopeia’.  Back in May 2017, Olly Penrice and Tom O’Donoghue presented a widefield image of the region and described their image as the ‘Breaking Wave’, which seemed apt.\r\n\r\nThis image is a four panel mosaic.  Data were gathered between 8 October 2018 and 6 January 2018 from a remote imaging rig in Spain owned and operated by Barry Wilson and Steve Milne.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: Takahashi FSQ 106\r\nCamera: QSI 68390\r\nFilters: Astrodon HaLRGB\r\nMount: 10 Micron GM1000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 83 x 1200\r\nLum: 144 x 600s\r\nRed: 72 x 600s\r\nGreen: 69 x 600s\r\nBlue: 69 x 600s\r\n\r\nA total of 86 hours and 40 minutes of exposure.\r\n\r\nData Capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
