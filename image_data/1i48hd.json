    "description": "I took this shot of the northern Milky Way, including all of the Cygnus constellation and on up to Cepheus. The field of view is pretty massive here, 45 degrees on a side with a diagonal of over 60 degrees. That means it stretches 1/3 of the visible sky!\r\n\r\nAvid night sky photographers should be able to start picking out recognizable target after target. It’s so cool to see them all in relation to each other. If you are anything like me, you noticed some areas that look interesting that are rarely photographed.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it a little unique is that this was my first try at the Milky Way from significant light pollution in narrowband with the Radian Triad Ultra filter. The results are intriguing. The setup was a little tricky and I’m still dialing things in. So, this is a simple sneak peek.  \r\n\r\nThis little ASI533MC camera is so clean, I didn't even use calibration frames for this image.   This amounted to a test of the backspacing but I loved the initial results.   More to follow!",
