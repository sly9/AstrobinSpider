    "description": "The Crescent Nebula is an emission nebula in the constellation of Cygnus (The Swan).   The star at the centre of this object is a Wolf-Rayet star (WR 136) which is ejecting gas as a fast 'stellar wind'.  This stellar wind is colliding with and energizing gases left over from the star's previous state (around 250,000 years ago) as a red giant, leading to the complex pattern seen here.  \r\n\r\nImaging through Ha and OIII filters show these different gases well.\r\n\r\nThis image is the result of several nights of data collection from the Deep Sky West facility in New Mexico between March and June 2016.  It consists:\r\n\r\nRed: 8 x 300s\r\nGreen: 8 x 300s\r\nBlue: 8 x 300s\r\nHa: 18 x 1800s\r\nOIII: 17 x 1800s\r\n\r\nA total of 19.5 hours of exposure.",
