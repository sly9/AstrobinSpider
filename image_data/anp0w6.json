    "description": "IC 2574, also known as Coddington's Nebula, is a faint dwarf spiral galaxy discovered by American astronomer Edwin Foster Coddington in 1898.  Located in Ursa Major, a constellation in the northern sky, it is an outlying member of the M81 Group. It is believed that 90% of its mass is in the form of dark matter.\r\n\r\nIC2574 is receding from us at a speed of just 55 km/sec. It is about 50 thousand light-years across and located some 12 million light-years away in the northern constellation Ursa Major. IC 2574 is a member of the Messier 81 Group of galaxies. These dwarf irregular galaxies are thought to resemble some of the earliest that formed in the Universe. So these dwarf irregular galaxies serve as useful “living fossils” for studying the evolution of more complex galaxy types such as our own Milky Way, with its central bar and spiral arms.\r\n\r\nMy Collections:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2482/\" target=\"_new\">Abell Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2627/\" target=\"_new\">Planetary Nebulae</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2626/\" target=\"_new\">Galaxies</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.astrobin.com/users/jmacon/collections/2625/\" target=\"_new\">Sharpless 2 Objects</a>",
