    "description": "Here I have pointed towards zenith on an object I can see from Sweden but which is usually too low on the horizon for getting a good image. This is a 2-frame mosaic so I could fit in both the Witch and Rigel shining on her. 90 s exposures on the Witch and 30 s ones on Rigel. I really doubt I can get this deep on the Witch from back home, and I had almost none of satellite trails that mess it up when shooting at it from Europe. One challenge was of course to tame Rigel. For the first time here on Lizard Island I had a gradient issue, but not from light pollution but from Rigel, so natural in a way.  Dynamic Background Extraction in PI did a good job on the gradient.",
