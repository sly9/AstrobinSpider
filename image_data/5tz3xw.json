    "description": "Maybe the â€˜Running Chickenâ€™ Nebula should be renamed the â€˜Swimming Fishâ€™ Nebula, at least for this view. ðŸ˜Š\r\n\r\nThis rendition of the image was prepared after beginning-to-end reprocessing of data used before, including a differently cropped view. My original rendition showing a wider field-of-view will be updated similarly (with moderated lighting) in due course.\r\n\r\nIC 2944 is an emission nebula associated with an open cluster of stars approximately 6,500 light years from Earth, and can be seen in the constellation Centaurus. It is also known as 'Lambda Centauri' and the 'Running Chicken Nebula' (not that I can ever see the chicken, maybe fish). Dark Bok globules can be seen within the bright nebula.\r\n\r\nAcquisition Details:\r\nAstronomik Ha 6nm 1.25\":  10x360\", 2x720\", 2x600\"\r\nAstronomik OIII 6nm 1.25\": 3x1200\", 1x1800\", 2x600\", 9x720\", 4x900\"\r\nAstronomik SII 6nm 1.25\":  3x1800\", 5x720\" -10C, 9x900\"\r\nTotal Integration: 11.1 hours (all bin 1x1, -10C)\r\n\r\nThis image was processed in PixInsight using the Hubble palette (Red = SII, Green = Ha, Blue = OIII), with Lum = Ha . The final image was re-sampled by 150% for aesthetic reasons.",
