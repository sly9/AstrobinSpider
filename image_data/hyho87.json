    "description": "This is a HDR composition of two separate shots of the Moon: a full moon acquired on 01/26/2021 and a quarter Moon on 04/07/2021.\nEach of the shots was obtained with a lucky imaging tecnique and the composition is done in Photoshop.\nThe star-field behind is from another image of the same portion of sky. \n\nWhat I like most of this kind of image is the 3D look of the Moon.\n Let me know if you have any adivice to improve such kind of image!",
