    "description": "Mars image on April 28 with variable stability and good transparency! The images on the left are the real ones, the first with the south down and the second with the south up! On the right are the simulation images of the Martian face at the time of capture. The south polar cap is very evident while the north is barely visible. We also see orographic clouds over the volcanoes in Tharsis, especially over Mount Arsia. There is also fog over the Vallis Marineris that is already appearing close to the dark limbo of the planet.",
