    "description": "Collision between galaxies are one of the most interesting extra galactic events, and our Galaxy has a same fate with M31 Andromeda galaxy long time later (astronomical time scale). In local universe, M51 (known as Whirlpool galaxy) is a major example of colliding galaxies. Here are two different FoVs capturing same target. The wide field(2.0x1.5deg) with long exposure combined shows more depth toward this line of sight, and look at the a lot of other local galaxies. In the other ends, the longer focal length (0.5x0.4deg) reveals the more detailed features of the colliding galaxies.",
