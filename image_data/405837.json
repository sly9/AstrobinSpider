    "description": "My Winter project shows the Sulfur, Hydrogen, and Oxygen emissions in and around the Orion constellation in a very widefield view. In this false-color modified \"Hubble-pallet\" I show the Sulfur and Hydrogen emissions as the warm red-orange colors and the Oxygen emissions as Blue. As a bonus, towards the bottom of the image you can see the Rosette and Cone Nebula pair in the constellation Monoceros.\r\n\r\nIn the Winter months, Even in the brightest cities, you can make out the large rectangle constellation of Orion with the 3 belt stars down the middle. In my image you can see the bright red star Betelgeuse at the bottom-left of the rectangle. If you can imagine just how large the Orion constellation appears to your naked eye you can see the sky is most certainly not empty! Some of the most popular nebula reside in this constellation, try to find the Orion Nebula (M42) and The Horsehead Nebula (IC434) sitting within all the dust.\r\n\r\nWhen I was thinking of a target to shoot this last Winter, I really wanted to pair a widefield lens with my astronomy camera to capture the rich Hydrogen emissions around Orion. This is not new and has been done many times, usually in the form of HaRGB (using a Hydrogen-alpha filter to enhance a natural color image). A thought came to my mind that what if we were much further away from Barnard's Loop (the smile-shaped nebula) and were imaging it in narrowband. When imaging in narrowband, most nebula have strong Ha signal, moderate Sii signal, and faint diffuse Oiii signal. This combination creates those rainbow-esque images you often see from the Hubble scope. So where there is strong Ha signal, Sii typically follows, and I was puzzled why I could not find any examples of a wide narrowband view of Barnard's Loop. So after capturing plenty of Ha data I tried for some Sii exposures and to my surprise the signal was quite strong and showing up in a single exposure! So from that exposure I committed to going full SHO on Orion.\r\n\r\nNow here is where it gets interesting (or maybe not). Oiii emissions were expected around M42, The Horsehead, and Rosette Nebula, were a pleasant surprise on the \"head\" of Orion (SH2-264), but completely unexpected as a large-scale diffuse signal around Barnard's Loop. With a discerning eye you can see in the individual Oiii channel a very diffuse background glow extending around and below Barnard's Loop. I know from my data that it was signal well above the noise floor, but I cannot say for certain that it is in fact diffuse Oxygen emissions until someone else goes after this widefield view with the same results.\r\n\r\nView \"Revisions\" for channel examples: \r\nA: SHO\r\nB: SII\r\nC: Ha\r\nD: OIII\r\nE: Ha - starless\r\n\r\nEquipment:  \r\nLens: Rokinon 24mm f/1.4 (stopped to f/4)\r\nMount: Orion Sirius EQ-G (HEQ-5)\r\nNo autoguiding used\r\nImaging camera: ZWO ASI1600MM-Cool\r\n\r\nAccessories:\r\nQHYCCD PoleMaster\r\n\r\nSoftware:  \r\nSGP\r\nPHD2\r\nCdC\r\nStarNet\r\nPixInsight\r\n\r\nAcquisition:  \r\nLocation: Atoka, OK (Bortle 3)\r\nDates: 1/4/19, 1/5/19, 1/27/19, 1/30/19, 2/7/19, 3/5/19\r\nGain: 200 Offset: 50\r\nCamera temp: -20C\r\nSii: 53x600\" Astrodon 3nm\r\nHa: 42x600\" Astrodon 5nm\r\nOiii: 43x600\" Astrodon 3nm\r\nTotal integration time: 23hr\r\n64x darks per calibration (master from library)\r\n30x flats per calibration\r\n200x bias per calibration (master from library)\r\n\r\nPreprocessing:\r\nBatch PreProcessing script to generate calibrated images\r\nStarAlignment\r\nLocalNormalization\r\nImageIntegration\r\nDrizzleIntegration\r\nDynamicCrop each master\r\nDBE each master\r\n\r\nCreated a starless version of each channel using StarNet for use later in processing:\r\nTGV & MMT noise reduction (via Jon Rista's method)\r\nArcSinhStretch x3\r\nHistogramTransformation\r\nStarNet\r\n\r\nLuminance Processing:\r\nDuplicated the master Ha to use as the luminance\r\nTGV & MMT noise reduction (via Jon Rista's method)\r\nArcsinhStretch x3\r\nHistogramTransformation\r\nHDRMultiscaleTransform to restore M42 and Rosette\r\nCombined the starless Ha image with the luminance using PixelMath expression \"F=0.4; (1-(1-$T)*(1-s)*F)+($T*~F)\" (s=starless photo).\r\nVery small amounts of MMT noise reduction\r\nHistogramTransformation\r\nUnsharpMask\r\nHDRMultiscaleTransform to reveal overblown parts of Barnard's Loop\r\n\r\nPreparing the separate Sii, Ha, and Oiii starless images for tonemapping (applied to each master individually):\r\nHDRMultiscaleTransform to reveal M42 and Rosette\r\nHistogramTransformation\r\n\r\nCombined prepared Sii, Ha, and Oiii masters with ChannelCombination:\r\nR: Sii\r\nG: Ha\r\nB: Oiii\r\n\r\nTonemap Processing:\r\nInvert>SCNR green>Invert to remove magenta\r\nSeveral a/b channel CurvesTransformations using ColorMasks to alter the channels to an aesthetically pleasing palette\r\nMMT for slight noise reduction\r\n\r\nCombined Tonemap with Luminance using LRGBCombination\r\nCurvesTransformation for slight contrast\r\nCurvesTransformation saturation\r\nMorphologicalTransformation for star size reduction\r\nResampled to 40% for web posting",
