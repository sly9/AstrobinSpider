    "description": "Cyg X-1 provided the first observational evidence of a black hole. One of its jets appears to have created the bubble-like structure which shows best in OIII. This target was suggested by Paul Kummer, who would have been with us in July but for the pandemic, and taken with a dual TEC140/Mesu 200/Atik 460/Moravian setup co-owned by myself, Tom O'Donoghue and Steve and Elisabeth Milne.\r\n\r\nOIII 25x15mn, Ha 20x15, L 11x15, R and G 6 x 10, B 7x10. (17 hours and 10 minutes total.)\r\n\r\nOn the bonus side the sky was outstandingly transparent but a heat wave made for very poor seeing and my OIII filmter in the Atik is terrible! The X-1 generated loop is heavily emphasized in the processing but that was the object of the excercise.",
