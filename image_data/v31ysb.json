    "description": "Inspired by the fantastic job Alberto Pisabarro did with this data (https://astrob.in/5tbwco/0/), I wanted to try it myself. \r\n\r\nThis is my first try with Hubble's data. Instead of just reproducing the image already released by STScI Outreach in 2018, I switched off my 'auto-constrained mode' to focus on the complex textures. I also tried to keep the whole field. \r\n\r\nVery, very clean dataset from STScI Outreach Imaging Team... processing was a pleasure.\r\n\r\nHST WFC3/UVIS instrument. I used only F658N, F656N and F502N filters data, corresponding to [NII], HÎ± and [O III] emission lines. \r\n\r\nRetouched manually to remove light leak from a out of field star.",
