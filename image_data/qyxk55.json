    "description": "A close look at the \"head\" region of the Seagull Nebula, which resides within the winter constellation of Monoceros.  Its gaseous hydrogen clouds are some 3800 light years away.  Of interest, is a jagged river of dense-dark gas, which may give rise to new stars and possibly planets.  The image was taken over a period of two hours on the night of January 9th. A RASA 8 telescope armed with the ASI294 camera gathered the photons that produced this colorful picture.",
