    "description": "Going back to 2014 when I first got myself into Astrophotography, I built my own tracker mount (CNC the gear, stepper motor, rotary decoder and Arduino) and fixed my Olympus E-m5 with 300mm F6.3 zoom lens on it, I was able to capture Andromeda galaxy total of 35 subs 30sec each, and after learning how to stack and process those images few details started to show up, I was super happy with the results.\r\n\r\nFast forward two years later with iOptron ZEQ25 mount, Celestron EdgeHD 9.25” with hyperstar, ZWO ASI1600MM at (gain 300) and Astronomik HaLRGB filters, (Lum 20x15sec, 20x30sec, 24x60sec – Red 20x30sec – Green 20x30sec – Blue 22x30sec and Halpha 15x120sec) and the results are just WOW.\r\n\r\nAndromeda galaxy (M31, M32 and M110) is 2.5 million light-years away, the closest spiral galaxy to our Milky Way. It’s the most distant thing you can see with your eye alone or pair of Binoculars",
