    "description": "The whole field in this image is essentially Sharpless 2-119 (AKA LBN 391). It is in a region of emission nebulosity in the constellation of Cygnus. The bright blue star is HD 203064 (aka SAO 50690, 68 Cygni). This star is considered one of the more significant of 6 ionizing stars for the emission region. Within the overall structure of Sh2-119 are seven LBN objects (LBN 383, 389, 390, 393, 400, 401, 402) and  nine LDN objects (LDN 942, 943, 944, 946, 947, 948, 951, 952, 953). Weakly seen in this image data is the small Ha region PN WE 2-245 (formerly classified as a planetary nebula) as well as background galaxies PGC 66592 and PGC 66627. These object and some of the brighter stars are seen in the <a href=\"http://www.jthommes.com/Astro/images/Sh2_119_FSQ_PI3_PS1_Crp_annotated.jpg\">annotated image</a>.  The Horizontal FOV is 120'.",
