    "description": "Hi,\r\nCalifornia from a decent cannon! Canon 400mm f2.8L II IS USM in action. Unfortunately, Canon did not survive this misty night and the glass was collapsed by the damp, hence the halo of mostly Menkib stars. Material collected from the area of ​​Nur nad Bugiem.\r\n\r\nCalifornia Nebula - An emission nebula located in the constellation Perseus. It was discovered on November 3, 1885 by Edward Barnard. Its shape resembles the California coast. It is located about 1,500 light years from Earth and spans about 100 light years.\r\n\r\n51 x 120s ISO1600 @ F3.5 iOptron CEM 25p Canon 6D mod",
