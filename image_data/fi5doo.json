    "description": "This patch of sky in the constellation of Gemini is home to several supernovae. The most alluring and studied is the Jellyfish Nebula (IC443) about 5,000 light-years away that exploded between 3,000-30,000 years ago. Its true age is unknown due to the misalignment of the pulsar that was left behind located on the left outer ridge (middle-left) of the nebula. It’s anchored top and bottom by two bright stars, Mu (top) and Eta Geminorum (bottom) at the foot of Castor, one of the twins.\r\n\r\nThe Jellyfish Nebula itself is pictured at the bottom right and located in the galactic anticenter direction (l=189.1°), close to the galactic plane (b=+3.0°), with \r\nthe brighter arcing ridge of emission colliding with the less dense hydrogen region above it and the dangling tentacles being blown apart by the surrounding \r\ngamma radiation. An emission nebula cataloged as SH2-249 (IC-444) fills the field of view in the middle and top of the image.\r\n\r\nThis image was constructed using narrowband image data, with emissions from sulfur, hydrogen and oxygen atoms shown in red, green and blues hues.\r\n\r\nShot from my backyard in San Diego.",
