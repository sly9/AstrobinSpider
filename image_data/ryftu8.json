    "description": "This is a complete reworking of my latest image of the Cygnus Wall. In that image I was experimenting with color palette and saturation and, after going back an looking at it with fresh eyes, I REALLY disliked it.  I decided to rework the image from scratch.  I think this is a much better version than the <a href=\"https://astrob.in/llnjfw/0/\">previous one</a>, both in terms of color and detail that I was able to bring out.\r\n\r\nI hope you agree but, as always, I welcome your comments and criticisms.",
