    "description": "A ‘Dervish’ is a member of a Muslim religious order who follows an ascetic way of life.  Some dervishes practice ecstatic, devotional rituals (sema), and this gave rise to the term ‘Whirling Dervish’.  Whether or not the dust cloud at the centre of the Soul Nebula resembles such an individual, I cannot say.  Nevertheless, the term ‘Whirling Dervish’ has been applied to this feature.  \r\n\r\nThis star forming region is to be found around 6,500 light years away in the constellation of Cassiopeia.\r\n\r\nIC1871 was photographed between 15 December 2018 and 27 January 2019 from a remote imaging rig in Spain that is owned and operated by Barry Wilson and me.\r\n\r\nCapture details are as follows:\r\n\r\nTelescope: TEC 140 \r\nCamera: QSI 690\r\nFilters: Astrodon 3nm NB \r\nMount: 10 Micron GM2000HPS\r\n\r\nHa: 24 x 1200s\r\nOIII: 22 x 1200s\r\nSII: 22 x 1200s\r\n\r\nA total of 22 hours and 40 minutes exposure.\r\n\r\nData Capture: Steve Milne & Barry Wilson\r\nImage Processing: Steve Milne",
