    "description": "The last one in a set of wide fields taken with the Canon 200mm lens. Both objects are most frequently shown individually, but not often together. \r\n\r\nIC443 is strong in Ha (and SII) but O3 only appears around the \"jelly fish\" and very weakly in IC444 where the signal is drowned in Ha.\r\nIn contrast,  the center of the monkey head contains a lot of O3 and it is easily visualized.\r\n\r\nI have dismantled this setup and wait for better weather to go after some galaxies now.\r\nHope you like it, CS\r\nVolker",
