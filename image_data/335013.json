    "description": "My first attempt at the Seagull nebula, although I think it looks more like a Phoenix. My son says it looks like Fawkes from the Harry Potter movies.\r\n\r\nFinal image is a crop because I changed framing after the first night of integration.\r\n\r\nSeeing and transparency were abysmal at best on all 3 nights, high cirrus were also present on and off. Wisconsin weather isnâ€™t just not astrophotography friendly, especially in the winter. From lemons .....come lemonade!",
