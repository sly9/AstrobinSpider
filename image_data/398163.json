    "description": "Here is my first image in LRGB since my return after some time out.\r\nSome nice data to play with from SSRO - spent a lot of time working on the layers of colour and tone to try and provide as many perceived details as possible.\r\nPlate solving does not seem to recognise this area - maybe it is too busy!\r\nThere are a plethora of features from the main blue reflection nebulae a variable nebula,  some dark nebula and for good measure some Herbig-Haro objects.\r\nHope you enjoy.",
