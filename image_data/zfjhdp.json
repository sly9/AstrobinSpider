    "description": "A remarkably difficult object, I see why it isn't imaged that often now (other than its location being in the Southern Hemisphere). It is spectacularly dim, making it rather difficult to pull details out of. However, what I found the most difficult was controlling the stars while trying to perform some of the intense stretching to bring out the dust. A lot of the dust is rather thin and leads to a bloating / huge glowing area around the brighter stars, and it would quickly get out of control. I think taking a second crack at it though definitely helped while keeping that in mind. Not my absolute favorite, but I think it is the best I can do for now on this target. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",
