    "description": "Here we have my attempt at M65, one of the Leo Triplet.  These seem to be so often imaged as a group and I thought it was a good idea to try to image these separately this galaxy season.  This intermediate spiral of 90,000 ly in diameter lies about 35 million ly away in Leo.  It is espimated that it contain about 200 billion stars.\r\n\r\nThis was an interesting image to make and I'm fairly pleased with it.  M65 is not a very colorful galaxy and I looked at a lot of professional images to sort of calibrate my eye for saturation and the like.  I shot a good amount of Ha thinking that I might be able to bring out a H3 region in the galaxy but to no avail.  I did however, use the Ha data in processing my L channel and that seemed to have a good affect on the final L.  When I tried to incorporate the Ha, all I got was a pinkish tone throughout the image which leads me to believe that perhaps this Ha filter is just not narrow enough.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this was a very nice project to do, the OAG is giving me superb guiding resulting  eccentricity values around 0.4 or a little less and noticeably tighter stars.  Fewer throw-aways too...\r\n\r\nI hope you like it and as always, comments and criticism encouraged.\r\n\r\nCS and good health!",
