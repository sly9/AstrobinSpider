    "description": "During the stay (too short!) In the Hautes Alpes, between 2 shots, I was able to create a small mosaic (3 pics) of the center of the Wilky Way. I could have done it more properly.\r\nOnly 180s for each picture, without DOF.\r\n\r\nThe sky, which was excellent, allowed to reveal much detail in this region of the sky, as among other nebulae like Omega, Trifide, Lagoon, clusters M7 and M22 ...\r\nAn HD version of 10000px width is available by clicking on the image below: http://maximeoudouxphotographie.fr/centre-de-voie-lactee-haute-definition/",
