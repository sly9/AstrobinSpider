    "description": "The run-up between the two giants\r\nCredit: Giuseppe Donatiello\r\nCanon EOS 4000D + EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 III on tripod\r\n\r\nI had never spent so much time composing an image, taking shots in each cloudless evening, but the rarity of the event (which I had been waiting for for a few years already) was worth commitment. It was not an easy task because many shots were taken using a short \"window\" of time between my return home after work and sunset, very short in December.\r\n\r\nIt is a more demanding composition than it seems because you have to move, as much as possible, into the same position with minimal error. With the sequence of an occulation or an eclipse it is much simpler because you are there for the entire duration of the event, the images just add them and that's it. With this composition I had to use multilayer, trying to match the stable details (trees, houses, etc.). Then I had to select the shots to have a readable whole, taking care to find a balance and regularity. Equal intervals did not reconcile with the \"holes\" due to the overcast sky, instead a progressive sequence (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 days) was functional and I had all the shots! Clearly, a number of them are left out and I'll try to use them some other way.\r\n\r\nDespite everything, I am satisfied with this result and hope you like it.",
