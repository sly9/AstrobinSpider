However, I have learned a few new techniques since then ... and abandoned a fair few others!  In any event, I thought it was worth having another go at it.  \r\n\r\nThe Seagull nebula lies around 3,800 light years away in the constellation of Monoceros.  This is data from the Deep Sky West facility in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nSII: 4 x 1800s\r\nHa: 23 x 1800\r\nOIII: 7 x 1800s\r\n\r\nA total of 17 hours exposure",
