    "description": "Here is my animation of AR 2781 from yesterday.  Data was suboptimal and I tossed several files. I had variable seeing and clouds.\r\n\r\nI captured 10s video every 30 s for 40 minutes\r\n\r\nProcessing flow:\r\nStacked in AS3!\r\nAligned in ImPPG\r\nTransfered to PI (batched processed with process container and image container)\r\n-Dynamic Crop (large crop)\r\n-ABE (subtract, normalize)\r\nImPPG for deconvolution and sharpening (batch processing). This could be performed in PI.  I had to realign in ImPPG since I wasnt happy with initial results.\r\nBack to PI \r\n-RGB convert (color\r\n-Color\r\n-Histogram adjustment\r\n-PIPP to make .gif (20fps)\r\n\r\nSolar equipment is pretty pricey so I decided to try and upload my data for people to  try it.  I am including a link to my master stacked calibrated frames (see link above).  If you publish please mention where you got the data.  As you will notice I had a pretty big crop for the animation.\r\n\r\nIf you have PI and want to download ImPPG (outstanding software for solar), here is a tutorial by Chuck. (This is a great tutorial).  Obviously it focuses on prom but you can use the same principles. I find ImPPG is a little easier to fine tune deconvolution and sharpening.\r\n\r\nChuck Astrophotography tutorial\r\nhttps://youtu.be/VXijbjkclMc\r\n\r\nWarren's excellent tutorial\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI2PGDVrxk0&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nHere is an excellent tutorial on ImPPG\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LpiVFcabbo",
