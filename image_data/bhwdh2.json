    "description": "Wanted to image this region for a while and it took some time to gather the data owing to cruddy weather and a desire to get enough integration time to do it justice.  The Cave Nebula area is part of the greater Cepheus molecular cloud region and is home to many interesting targets.  I framed this to highlight the emission area of the \"cave\" but also to grab a good bit of the dust cloud nearby which includes other goodies including HH 168 (the deep red blotch at the right) and GN 22.55.2 (a small emission nebula).  Although it's tough with NB to pick up the reflection nebulosity that frequents this area, I was pleased that I got some good structure on HH 168 showing several outflows and also was able to highlight many of the awesome dust streamers that litter the foreground.  Thanks for looking!\r\n\r\nWeb sites:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.stellarsolace.com/\">StellarSolace</a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StellarSolace-1588021434610921/\">Facebook page</a>",
