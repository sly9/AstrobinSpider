    "description": "This is a reprocessing of Cygnus Wall data using Steve Milne’s PI Pixel Math formula for a “natural” color palette with narrowband data (Ha, OIII, and SII). In addition, in this version I created a master luminance layer using Ha and SII sub lights with HFR <1.8, only 4 hours of data total. For my taste, I prefer the look of this image to my earlier post in which I used a HST palette approach.  I find this image has more subtle detail and values. What do you think?",
